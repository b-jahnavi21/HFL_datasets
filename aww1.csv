aww,"&gt; Certain sharks, particularly among those that live in reefs, have a swim bladder that filters air through their gills for them so they can survive.

Huh? 

1. Sharks do not have swim bladders
1. Swim bladders are for buoyancy control and not breathing
1. Sharks pass water across their gills, not air
1. Many types of shark use buccal pumping to pump water across their gills and don't have to swim all the time"

aww,"For anyone who is interested, a good way to help a stunned bird is to pop it in a box/shoebox with a cover over and leave it somewhere dark and quiet like a cupboard for an hour. Then take the box outside and leave open under a tree. If the bird flies off it is fine, if not, it needs to go to a vet.

EDIT: Because a lot of people are asking: In Australia, normal vets will take injured wildlife off your hands for free. They will euthanise humanely on the spot if necessary, or provide treatment and then pass them to a licensed wildlife carer."

aww,"I think it's probably more that dogs' digestive tracts adapt to a kibble diet, in a similar fashion to how vegetarians will adapt to a non-meat diet and can make themselves sick trying to eat meat after too long without.

but in that time your world slowed down, you took the time to see

that i would be ok again - so much you learned from me!

that life can come n go so fast, a fragile thing -  it's true

may all the good you do for others, friend - come back to you"
aww,"Yeah, I meant that it was weird that in America, our culture always feels the need to disclose whether or not a teacher is married by how we address them. It doesn‚Äôt really make sense now that I think about it, because as you said, why should kids care anyways?"

That makes you a really good person, really well adjusted.  Someone who spends all his time shitting on people who achieve things he never will."

This all seems so unreal, but it's an extremely clear memory. I was probably 8 or 9 years old."

I'm 30 now, and I will literally gag at the slightest whiff of any sort of whiskey. Just thinking about it gave me the shivers actually.

So yeah, apparently making a pretty good pet at first and then a fucking horrible pet.  Hence, you don't want them as a pet."

Wombats have a giant bone mass in their rear end that they use to attack predators.  
You may wonder how they use a bone mass in their rear to defend themselves.  
Well you see, wombats are fast af when they sprint, so they get to full speed and slam the breaks on, resulting in the predator slamming into this bone mass and getting messed up by it. Think a fast moving car into a brick wall."
aww,"This is really cool, something similar happened to UFC fighter Calvin Kattar, a bird started [following him on the street](https://gfycat.com/FakeSimpleAsiantrumpetfish), stuck to him [like they're best buds](https://gfycat.com/unequaledbrownkillifish) and stayed with him for a good day or two before flying off."

aww,"Very much tameable, but they‚Äôre very intelligent, escape artists, and curious shitheads (for the latter, picture your average housecat assholery, but where the housecat has dexterous hands). 

They don‚Äôt make good housepets, but if you live out in the country, it‚Äôs very easy to make raccoons ‚Äúoutdoor cats‚Äù. If they get food, they‚Äôll stick around, learn to trust you, and eventually have litters and bring on more raccoons (but the moms can turn aggressive seemingly out of the blue when their young are concerned).

The majority of people dislike even having outdoor raccoons on their properties. They tear stuff up, find *all the ways* to get into your garbage, aren‚Äôt good for crops or farm feed, and don‚Äôt have much natural predators, which leaves you with a whole lot of raccoons.

A bunch of raccoons were once imported to Japan because people wanted them as pets. Japenese people no longer keep raccoons as pets, and Japan now has a raccoon problem."
aww,/r/mastiff would like a crosspost
aww,It's what they do with their mates. She said the head is platonic space but down below the neck is sexy space. I'm skeptical since birds probably didn't participate in any Kinsey or Masters and Johnson surveys. :P (but really body touching is mating behavior)
aww,Just doing what needed to be done üíô
aww,"A way to prevent a bird flying into you window is as simple as putting a sticky note on it near the middle and some near the sides. They can't tell that there's glass, it looks like a shaded alcove or cave to them. This allows them to recognize that there is something there. 

If you want to step up your game window clings work great. Even better are the UV reflective clings that go on the outside of the window. They look super bright to birds but look like etched glass to us."

aww,"There used to be a cockatoo in a pet store near me named Smokey. That bird LOVED being scratched under his crest. As you scritched him, his head would sink and his wings would spread until his beak was resting on the counter and his wings were fully stretched out.

aww,"I was on the verge of falling asleep at 5pm from crippling depression if I‚Äôm being honest. I really, really needed this."
aww,"What I‚Äôve learned from doing some research as an architect: Aside from keeping blinds completely closed, the best way to effectively reduce bird strikes is to have a ceramic frit pattern on the outermost layer of glass (surface-1). Of course, this is an expensive solution that can only be applied to brand new windows, so it typically gets used in commercial, not residential, buildings. Another product called Ornilux has a pattern embedded in the glass that birds can see but humans can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm hoping frits will become more affordable and widely available in the future! (Many glass manufacturers still won‚Äôt even print on surface 1, as they are concerned about warrantying the glass.) Some major cities are starting to pass laws that will make glass standards more stringent."

aww,"I was outside my house power washing stuff, and saw a bird sail directly into a bay window, almost power washed him right out of existence by accident but stopped in time. 

Found the little guy shaking under a bush. I left him there a minute while I hurriedly found a box and threw some soft moss inside and Kleenex inside it. Brought the box out front, and found the bird still quivering in the bush. Slowly approached him and gently scooped him up and held him in the cup of my hand. Just sat down and let him work out his daze. 

We probably sat there together for an hour or more. He still seemed super out of it so I eventually deposited him in his box, he settled in pretty quick. I added a tiny cup of water and closed the cardboard flaps into a gable, so there was a crack for air and light. 

Left the box on my kitchen table, and my then-fianc√© told me to be prepared to find a dead bird in the morning, I sort of agreed, and we went to bed. 

Next morning, open up the flaps and hello! Little sparrow bro looking up at me, all bright eyed, alert and poised. Brought the box outside, he spent some time looking up around the sky and around the deck. Then the littlest flitter of wings and he flew into our trellis, perched there a minute, staring at me, then flew off not to be seen again. 

Until the next day, and the day after that. And not everyday anymore but pretty regularly he stops by to peck around in my plants and always spends a moment looking at me. His name is Medgar, and I know it‚Äôs the same bird because his head feathers still look all fucked up."
aww,His tail is working like a propeller.
aww,Can confirm. Heart stolen. He is too cute!
aww,"Can confirm, there used to be a wombat that lived nearby, he was super cute but if you got a bit to close to his burrow he would chase you, and he was pretty fast too! Nothing is scarier than being chased by a wombat"

aww,"""Sir why did you bring me this bird that's been dead for an hour due to suffocation? """
aww,"It laid on the table for about 20 minutes until it sprung up, flew around for a few seconds, then landed on my lap and chilled with me for about 5 more minutes until it flew back off into the sky."
aww,"It was just a silly thing to start, and normally he won't allow you to put anything on him except his sweater when it's cold. I'm wondering if he is seeing different colors for the first time. Everything looks more vivid with blues and greens, and dogs tend to see those colors as well as brown. 

My place is 20 meters from the beach, and I think the colors might have been more vibrant than he is used to seeing."

Ended up having to pull security during the show, increased threat level because of said event, so I never got to see the show. Totally forgot about the big TK picture I kept in my armor until I got home two months later and I realized I hadn‚Äôt had anything remotely dangerous happen since I had his picture.

I would always feed my cats the best quality cat food I could afford. Lately, I haven't been able to keep that up. They love the damned Friskies gravy cans more than any expensive (2-3X the price) food I've ever given them. I hate this, because from what I've read it's not very good for them."

aww,I wanna bet they were actually alpacas.
aww,I just had a Hairy Woodpecker *insert dirty jokes here* hit my window the other day. I took a fleece and bundled it up to create a nest with a roof then put him inside to recover. When I came back 20 mins later he had his head under his wing sleeping. Recovered well cause he took off the instant I touched the fleece.
aww,I was prepared to be horrified. Less gruesome than I thought.

Step 3: they‚Äôll poop in your hand right before flying off

aww,So I just got my nails done last night and this reminds me of when the nail techs are talking in Vietnamese to each other in soft tones. Most of the time they don't even look in each other's directions.
aww,But she white walker now
aww,That is so strange
aww,"I've only had her for 2 weeks, so I'm still getting to know her, but she's very agile and energetic. I can throw the pony tail on the dresser and she'll hop back and forth from the bed to the dresser. It's rather impressive"
aww,"&gt;I think sharks in the waler family need to keep moving. So Makos and Great White sharks.

Makos and white sharks aren't in the ""w[h]aler family."" They're mackerel sharks (Lamnidae). You are right that those sharks need to maintain forward movement, though.

&gt;Bottom feeding sharks are more closely related to rays...

This is categorically false. There are a number of benthic (bottom-dwelling) sharks that are scattered among the various orders and families of sharks (in both the superorder Squalomorphii and the superorder Selachomorphii...both of which are equally distant from the Batoidea, the superorder which contains the skates and rays)."
aww,"Have you ever heard the wolf cry to the blue corn moon?

Well my friend, today you have!"

aww,So much fluff!  I want to pet that fluff!
aww,Those eyes.... they stare to the left and right of my soul... cute sweater tho
aww,I couldn‚Äôt do it!
aww,What did you do before?
aww,Omg I pet a bird today too! I went outside to my rock garden to check on my succulents and there was the tiniest little bird looking right up at me. It‚Äôs little beak was red from eating the wild strawberries in my yard. I gently took my finger and stroked its back. It barely moved so I did it again. Then it hopped away. Such a sweet moment!
aww,Ah yeah a murder cat love it
aww,His teeny tiny hands!!!
aww,"I had the same thing happen twice. First time there was blood from the birds mouth, and I held it in my hand and tried to comfort it until its last breath. Second one was a few years later and was basically the same thing that happened here. 2 very different emotions."

Its family lives on though and there's always at least two birds living in it, they seem quite happy in their little home away from the cold with the house's heating warming them up"

aww,I imagine there be lots of big poops from that household.
aww,"Came here to say this! When I was 12 or so, I sat at the window and watched a huge flock of warblers migrate through the yard. It was incredible. One flew right at my face and at the last moment pulled up, striking the glass with its belly. It continued to flutter, hovering motionless on the glass, for about a second - then rocketed up into the trees. The thing that stood out the most, seeing as the warbler was literally two inches away from my face, was a red band across its breast. Initially I thought, *oh no! He‚Äôs hurt!* but as it turns out, my bird book showed that‚Äôs just how Northern Parulas look. :)"

aww,"You would be right if _S. fasciatum_ wasn't commonly referred to as the leopard shark in the English-speaking regions of its native range (_e.g._, Australia).

aww,The real LPT is always in the comments
aww,"True. The bird had been stunned on a table for 20 minutes. Snapped out of it, flew around for a few seconds, landed on my lap and let me pet it for a few more minutes. It easily could‚Äôve just flown away off the bat but it came back around and chilled. If that‚Äôs not thanking me idk what is"

aww,It‚Äôs head was much softer than it‚Äôs body/wings. I also think it was just a lil baby so it also had baby feathers which are waaaay softer than adult ones
aww,"This is a really good question. I did some googling and it appears that birds are too small to receive treatment for a brain bleed. If they are so bad that they shouldn‚Äôt sleep, they are sadly untreatable anyway."

aww,"I think the word you‚Äôre looking for is natural? Just leave the bird alone if that‚Äôs your preference.

Technically, crushing its head quickly with something heavy is the most humane thing to do if you can see it is not going to recover. But I don‚Äôt have the stomach for it. The cat strategy also doesn‚Äôt work well for larger animals in shock like ducks, which I have also used this on before."

aww,We had a hummingbird get trapped inside our house once. It was frantically trying to leave through a big picture window and got caught behind the shades. I reached in to try to move the shades and it came over and landed on my finger and just sat there a moment catching its tiny breath. It was AMAZING. I could see it sitting there but couldn‚Äôt feel anything because it was so light. I carefully took it over near the open door and it zoomed off and went straight to the feeder.
aww,"Tried running past a family of geese like that on a woodland trail once. You think those f-ers are mean normally? They are grade A assholes when their goslings are around, nearly fractured my right pinky metacarpal trying to get away."

aww,"But man, does our new logo suck"
aww,They are both MUCH lighter than you'd expect when picking them up and much softer. I had to rescue a bird that flew in through our chimney from our cat a while back. It's very odd how light they are - you feel like an ultra powerful giant due to how fragile they seem.
aww,You are a disney princess now
aww,My cat is on prescription cat food now because he developed urinary tract crystals that caused a blockage. The vet said it was most likely brought on by cheap cat food... Wish I had splurged on the higher quality stuff in the beginning because now I pay $45 for a small bag less than 10lbs.

aww,"I petted a vireo who flew into one of my windows.  I just used my little finger so it would be a very soft pet.  I wouldn‚Äôt have done it except some of the feathers were ruffled from his ordeal so I smoothed them down.  It was pretty soft, but I was too afraid of smoothly crushing him by accident to really notice. 

I sat with him for about 45 mnutes and put out some water and the most luscious strawberry in my refrigerator right in front of him in case he got hungry.  He didn‚Äôt.

Anyway, my mother always told me that if you sing ‚Äúgod bless america‚Äù (or ‚Äúgod save the queen‚Äù if it‚Äôs a british bird) it will relax them.  So I started singing after the petting/smoothing and banquet presentation.  That‚Äôs when he opened his mouth real wide, slowly turned his head to look me directly in the face - presenting me with a full on expression of indescribable contempt, and flew away.

aww,I was thinking it looked like an Ewok and a teddy bear had a baby.
aww,"Awww

Once I found a bird and realized it was still alive, and probably dazed from flying into the windows. I was on my way to work and was trying to come up with a plan as it let me scoop it up. 

I worked at the mall at the time, and the idea of scaring the poor thing further by having it wake up in a weird place, I figured I‚Äôd at least walk around to another entrance and minimize time between outside and a box/small dark space in the break room. I already had a mental list of people to potentially call if the little bird was injured. 

It was cold and windy, so I  was using both arms to sorta cradle the bird. I also didn‚Äôt want to move too much as it wasn‚Äôt moving much, and I didn‚Äôt want to injure it further. 

Lo, part way through the walk, little dude perks up!! I was so excited! My reward, of course, was pets and time together! 

Just kidding!! The bird made eye contact and shit on my arm before flying away. I‚Äôm glad that it wasn‚Äôt injured and felt well enough after some time to fly off, but what a shitty reward"

aww,I believe putting reflective tape on your windows should help the birds realize that they can't fly through it. That's at least what we did eons ago in my second grade class when we put out bird feeders for bird watching.
aww,"I‚Äôm pretty sure none of that is real

aww,They are floofer poofers!
aww,"&gt;I thought its leash was attached to the wall and I thought ""Isn't that dangerous""? Then I realized it was just the electrical plug.

aww,"I'm so jealous! I've never had my pup that asleep on me! So cute, I could die!!"

aww,"This is the complete opposite of the guy who had a bird smash in through his window, shit on his laptop, then die."
aww,"WE used to get hummingbirds in our house who would freak after flying past us when we opened the back door, they fly all over inside the house, burn up all their energy before flying up to the sunroof where they'd hide and go into a tuper.  We'd make them some sugar water, feed them from a tube,  and then keep them warm and quiet for a half hour before taking back outside in the shade to rest and recover.... all of them eventually flew away safely recovered.    I always was amazed to feel their tiny heartbeats while holding and stroking them (which they seemed to like)  The trick was not to distress them anymore than what they'd already been thru and feed/water them."

I used to watch those hummingbirds at the feeder for hours throughout the day, so holding one in my hand for a few minutes as it got it's bearings definitely had a big impact on me."
aww,"Australian here who has camped at Wilson‚Äôs Prom with these little fuckers. There cute and stubborn. Like a furry version of a toddler in a fairy outfit; the outfit makes you think they will do what you ask....

They are little tanks who destroy anything that stops them from getting food. We had one walk straight through two tents, steal lollies and keep walking out the other side.  Ripped huge holes in the tents. 

One teacher on Camp, who is an amazingly caring teacher and person, lost it at one wombat and was yelling and screaming at it to stop hassling the kids for food. The wombat, slightly confused, walked off thinking ‚ÄúWow, that one is noisy...‚Äù"
aww,"Okay, this is fucking adorable and I'm giggling like an idiot right now."

aww,she even lets you rub it!
aww,"I have balm too but I tend to use it on nicer occasions where I want it to look nice with a good sheen and smell nice as opposed to an everyday product.

The oils and creams are more maintenance and moisturizing products for me"

aww,I wanna know if the little bird whispered in your ear hmmmm
aww,"Yeah that's partially why I went to the oil, especially since I go through the balm a lot quicker it seems where I only need a couple drops a day of the oil."
aww,"It's the wet food that she goes after. As soon as I put it down, she wants to be on it like a plague of locusts. She's gets so  insane with it that I have to put her outside in order to give the cats a treat, and they don't exactly devour it, because they're cats and all."
aww,"I want one
*slides 20k across counter*
I SAID NOW DAMN IT"
aww,"But humans are ‚Äúdenser‚Äù compared to birds no? Like birds are more aerodynamic. They have light bones, and excrete solid urine so they‚Äôre not carrying excess water in bladders, etc
So mass wise humans are 700x but size or volume wise it may only be 500x maybe? Pulled that  number out of OP‚Äôs mom‚Äôs ass, and it is still crazy large. I guess all I‚Äôm saying is mass comparisons may be a little more misleading?"

aww,"I can't speak to this scientifically, but I've seen one of these sharks in the wild. It sat on the bottom while we snorkeled above it watching for a long time... 10-15 minutes. We would dive down to get as close as we could be it did not care at all. Eventually he moved to swim for about two minutes and resettled back on the bottom again."
aww,you're a disney princess now
aww,"Did you lose someone recently in your family ?
Might be a form of reincarnation..a way of saying thanking you and your action frees them from the chakra of rebirths"
aww,It is VERY rare for most mastiffs to bark. My parents own a bull and a British royal. It's super frightening when they bark because it's so rare. It's deep and growly.
aww,"I know what you mean, I have done similar for a big toad that got stuck in my Mum's neighbour's electric box, hehe.  That big guy ended up a garden pet to my Step-Dad, lol.  Legend. x"

aww,"I have a year old Old English. She doesn‚Äôt bark much but does bark from time to time. Looking forward to the mute part of her life. I will say that she has quite a vocal range, if you didn‚Äôt see her do it and just heard the barks I bet you could be mistaken that she was 4 or 5 different dogs."
aww,"As long as my kids were dressed I didn‚Äôt care if they went out with old Halloween costumes on over their cloths.
My son went to the mall as Frankenstein‚Äôs monster once and my daughter went in a ladybug costume a few times.

How small do they even make cat collars? This was basically all our Walmart had, I want to find something better fitting. For her size and personality hah"
aww,"Here's a basic rule:

If you live in the Western Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, SE Asia, etc.), call it a leopard shark.

If you live just about anywhere else - especially the U.S. - call it a zebra shark (because we have a _different_ ""leopard shark"" in the Eastern Pacific).

Both names are correct, but being mindful of the region you're in will help to avoid confusion.

And if you're on Reddit...idk maybe stick with the scientific name. :P

(Zebra shark is a safer default on Reddit tbh.)"
aww,Fair enough. I am basing my anecdotal evidence off of oriental cats (grew up with tonkinese and siamese cats) so I've definitely noticed some drastic pattern changes with them but can't honestly speak on cats of other breeds so you're probably right there.
aww,He wasn‚Äôt thanking you. The little dude had brain damage!

aww,Well if you just found it you should've left it
aww,omg what types of cats are these
aww,"Yes. The idea that you shouldn't sleep with a concussion is a myth, provided there's no internal bleeding. That said, I had weird dreams."
aww,STOP BEING SO FUCKING CUTE!
aww,"Yes, if you can get it in one go and a brick would be more precise. But I simply don‚Äôt have the stomach for it."

There are a lot of stray cats in the area, so I was standing guard more than keeping it company. It seemed like it had turned to stone, then slowly relaxed, and finally flew off after about five minutes. And as soon as he was gone, when I turned around to go back inside, one of the stray cats slinked (slunk?) into the yard.

I hope you have experience with raccoons, and if you don‚Äôt please take my advice and contact an animal sanctuary or other rehabilitation facility ASAP."
aww,"If you look through some of reddit's cat pics you'll find bell on cats are actually not common (at least not anymore, it's more of an older generation tradition). There are of course pros to the use of bell on cat's collar. some people think it helps them locate the cat, and some use it to warn off preys (birds in the garden etc) when the cat tries to catch them. But the cons are quite concerning though: As for the cat's health, as they have very acute hearing, having a literal BELL placed so near to their ears ringing 24/7 can easily damage their hearing, which can be irreversible. And as for they psychological side, yes some cats may not seem stress at time with the bell and the constant ringing, but like humans, stress can build up or at least the constant ringing will most likely put these cats on a higher stressed level compare to the rest of the 'bell-free' cats.

And yes of course the cat may see fine with the bell especially when you have put it on since you got her. But remember she does not have a choice. She's never been 'bell free'. So for her, it may be just that, like us humans when we're in an irritating situation that we cannot escape, many of us will just bear it quietly because there is no other option... \^-\^; 

Sorry if it came off a bit harsh, bro, I know you love your cat. I love that you love your cat too. :)

Maybe just give it a try and take that thing off for a week or so at least and see how she likes it?

All the best man."

I was drunk for the whole weekend, not sure how I didn't die of alcohol poisoning, but I woke up wearing her clothes and she in mine (not sure how that shook out) from what I've told we ran out of firewood to which I responded by obsconding with the chainsaw, running into the woods, felling a tree(in the dark) I deemed suitable for firewood, dragged it back the apparently 2 miles back to camp and exclaimed at the top of my lungs, quite drunkenly ""Now I don't wanna hear any complaining about fuckin firewood"" and promptly passed out in a hammock by the water. I never once dropped that bottle, I clutched it like it was giving me life. To this day, I refuse to drink Tequila or even look at a bottle of Jose Quervo."
aww,2 miles is 3.22 km

aww,Imagine flying into a wall you couldn't see and a giant 1000x your size picks you up. And then pets you. People are great.
aww,I think the little wiggling of tail keeps him move forward
aww,"she don't think that, she knows it."
aww,I had a similar experience once. I was walking home from school and I was 2 blocks away from my house I see a baby blue jay trying to fly over a small stone wall. It try‚Äôs and try‚Äôs but could seem to get a couple of inches of the ground. I go down next to it and it hops right on my show I just froze and took my back off and Kaye‚Äôs it down and carried it on that and when I got to my house I set out water and later it flew away just wanted to share my small story.
aww,"Funny, that's my favorite retaliation also."
aww,Are you a Disney Princess
aww,It's a matter of perspective really.
aww,Indeed he wobbled into my heart.
aww,"You‚Äôre actually the first person to comment about my shaking! That was the first thing I noticed about the video too. I was just trying to be as gentle as possible, with a side of panic attack because so really, really didn‚Äôt want birb to die."
aww,Hanzel and Gretel run out of breadcrumbs and just get better and better at taking cubic shits.
aww,"Me too. Blacked out on way too much vodka on 2 separate occasions when I was 17 (vodka and Mountain Dew the first time and pineapple vodka the second). Even at 25 the mere thought of vodka churns my stomach. It took me many a moon to learn my limit (alcohol takes longer to effect me and for most of my underage and early twenties I mistook that for a high tolerance) and the last time I got drunk off liquor was 2 years ago when I broke a 2 day fast with tequila (I meant to break my fast with food before heading to my friends to get ready for the night but I was running late and by the time we started drinking I forgot). I threw up pure stomach acid and it fucked up everything. Pretty sure it gave me a sinus infection, blisters in my throat, ear aches, jaw aches. I felt like I was dying for about 2 solid weeks. Even now I occasionally get random isolated pain in my throat and I feel like it‚Äôs because of damage from that time. Haven‚Äôt really touched liquor since."
aww,"Thank you for being so amazing with animals. I feel like many people don't view other animals as ""life"" and disregard their lives easily. This bird will remember you!"
aww,I answered your question you are over analyzing
aww,"Size and mass are two different things, son.

We're 721x the *mass* of a bluejay, but size is a measure of volume, mass is how much matter is contained within us.  We could be much smaller than them and still have a mass many times larger than a bluejay.

So you need to take the volume of a human, the easiest way to do that is water displacement.  

[The average human displaces about 18 gallons (69689.431mL) of water.](https://sciencing.com/measure-density-person-5834091.html)

I couldn't find data on bluejays [but a Budgie displaces 46.08 mL,](https://svpow.com/2013/06/01/how-dense-are-birds-some-new-old-data-also-hummingbirds-and-ketchup/) and they're about the size of a bluejay if not a tad smaller, so let's call it 50 to be fair.


So we're 721x the mass of a bluejay, but we're over 1,512 times the *size* of a Bluejay, on average."

aww,"You can also buy stickers and coatings which are mostly transparent to humans but visible to birds, since their eyes are sensitive to a different set of wavelengths."
aww,"it was a story that someone may have recognized, wasn't sure if you got multiple reply notifications"
aww,"I didn‚Äôt pick up the bird at all. I stroked its back trying to get it to snap back into reality, roughly 20 minutes later it stood up, flew around for a few seconds, then landed on my lap and allowed me to pet it. No force involved. The bird easily could‚Äôve flown alway off the bat, but it turned back around and landed on me. 

Watch where you step."
aww,"Sometimes the bird break their keel bone, which punctures their air sacs and they die slowly. Sometimes head injury, and they die slowly. Their position wouldn‚Äôt help either of these situations, but warmth and quiet to help them calm down can help them out of shock, since they are so sensitive just the heart rate or cold during shock could kill them, best to not mess with them too much other than keeping them safe and warm in a quiet place."
aww,The mom/caretaker joining in is great and adorable!
aww,"Congratulations!  You are now an official Disney Princess!  Please make your way down the hall for your fitting.  The mice are expecting you.  :)

I ran in and grabbed the bird (it had just flown into a wall).  Brought it outside, expecting it to immediately fly away.  I held my arm out, and it just sat there (I now realize it was stunned). So, I stood in the middle of a crowded outlet mall with my arm stretched out and a sparrow resting on my hand for a solid 5 minutes. I looked like a crazy lady, haha. Eventually the bird woke up from the shock, pooped on me, and flew away :)"

aww,"So I do this full time. I have dog handling experience and I'm certified in dog nutrition and planning on working towards getting dog training certification and I'm also privately insured.  A majority of my clients (the dogs) are rescue dogs, some of which come from horribly abusive pasts. I work with them (and sometimes the owners) one on one with leash training and learning how to trust humans and other dogs. It's more than just holding onto a leash. A good dog walker is hyper vigilant of their surroundings and the behavior changes of the dog they're walking and any person or dog they come upon.

I'm a 5'8, 125 lb female and I can safely walk 150+ lb dogs (and multiple at  time) and know how to safely break up dog fights. I've had to pick up a 90 lb rescue labradoodle and get her to safety when 5 dogs came out of nowhere and started attacking both of us. 

I also do boardings and doggie daycare at my house which is a great socializing opportunity for the skittish dogs."

aww,"A good way to help prevent birds from running into windows is keeping something reflective or solid on them. My university has some see-through stickers that can reflect light so the birds can see that the windows are actually there. Before they got those stickers, I'd always walk by at least 3 birds that died from crashing into the windows.  every week. Since then, I don't think I've seen a single dead bird."

They also do the same thing as the birds when I come outside, climb to the top of the fence and look at me waiting for honey roasted peanuts.

None of these little shits let me pet them wtf! Apparently they're just out there letting everyone else pet them, but then they come to me for a free meal and scatter when I stand up. Bunch of jerks.

aww,"Bird feathers are quite soft! Especially the downy feathers! There are different types of feathers on different part of the bird, and they have different textures.

Downy feathers are like a dog‚Äôs undercoat: they‚Äôre really soft, fine and fluffy. And they serve the same purpose, which is thermoregulation. Baby birds are so fluffy because they‚Äôre covered in down.  (They‚Äôre also EXTREMELY annoying to sweep up when your pet bird molts because they go EVERYWHERE and they‚Äôre SMALL)

Body feathers and coverts are smooth and kinda soft. 

Wing and tail feathers are the least soft. They have a thick quill to make them stiff for flight. The hairs are thicker, but pretty smooth to the touch. 

Overall, birds are really really soft to pet."

* Silver lining stories still fall under Rule 1. &gt; For example, ""Jakey was hit by a car and had cancer, but he is a happy little fella today!"" is not allowed.

aww,"I don‚Äôt really know as this was a first for me, but this little guy was laying on a table for quite a while, stood up, flew up and around for a few seconds, he easily could‚Äôve just flown away then, but instead he flew back into my lap and let me pet him. 

Most of the comments are saying things like ‚Äúbirds can‚Äôt feel sentience so they can‚Äôt be capable of wanting to thank or socialize with humans.‚Äù But I‚Äôd like to optimistically disagree. I feel like this birdie knew the risks and took them nonetheless.

aww,"Boxers are considered a ‚Äúbully‚Äù breed. 

Bully dogs share a common ancestor, the Molosser. These dogs date back to the Greeks and were identified by their short snouts and bred for their muscularity and guarding/defending abilities into the more common bull dog varieties we have today. This bully fam includes a few other breeds that don‚Äôt include ‚Äúbull‚Äù in the name like Boston terriors, Great Danes, pugs, mastiffs, staffordshires, and in this case, boxers, to name a few.

aww,"They see me Rollin, they hatin..."
aww,"They make separate kitten collars that are around 2‚Äù smaller than standard cat collars. They should have them at a pet store, rather than a pet department of a box store. They were kinda mixed in with the regulars at the one I went to, so it might take some looking. 

If she‚Äôs anything like my floofy girl, the standard cat collar will fit before she‚Äôs 6 months. Lyanna might not be small for long! In my experience the fluffy ones are often the big cats üòç."
aww,Which is Puddles? My dog's name is Puddles!
aww,Props to you for not killing the poor little guy‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,Unfortunately the dog only visits a couple times a day. I have obviously enquired about the best way to sneak one out of the hospital unnoticed. They thought I was joking.

aww,Ah I see you've found the prop for the next pet sematary movie.
aww,What a little goober
aww,"Some dogs just can't help but roll in it! Once they catch a whiff they will go and find it and some will eat it. It really can mess the day up if you need to hose the dog down. It has a very unique odour that really stays with you, so it's important to get them clean if they are going to be going home otherwise the house will smell too! Some owners are more bothered by it than others."
aww,Why is he sitting alone?
aww,Labs are so good.
aww,I love how much you love her.
aww,"For a moment I thought [you were talking about this](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/injured-grizzly-bear-warning-park-bow-valley-survived-unscathed-1.4272095), but nope."
aww,look at them mooooove
aww,"Hey, I know you mean well by rescuing these guys, but you should probably leave them where you found them. Momma rabbits only visit the nest maybe once or twice at dusk to feed the babies, so people usually don‚Äôt see them and assume the nest has been abandoned. The stress of moving the babies around and into an unfamiliar and unnatural environment can, and usually does, lead to them dying. If you have any concerns, call animal control or a rescue center, don‚Äôt try to do it yourself."
aww,"Just make sure you research rabbit treatment, baby rabbits have a very high mortality rate when away from parents. Not a week ago a friend of mine took one away from her dog and tried her best to take care of it, but unfortunately it didn't make it past 4 days."
aww,Oh...my...God.  Too freakin cute.  Cannot look away.
aww,"I once had this crazy situation in Mexico at a posada (small family-run hotel) where I was working. There was a big-ass cage full of budgies, and one budgie-sized sort of parrot. 

I was mopping this huge floor, and happened to look at the cage and notice the parrot passed right the hell out on the floor of the cage. Totally limp and unresponsive.

I didn't know what to do, and could not stop mopping, so I did what any titted-person would do, and shoved him into my cleavage to keep him warm and my hands free. 

Eventually I finished the cleaning and put him in a box with a soft t-shirt, and about ten minutes later heard him scuffling around in there. I opened the box, he tried to murder my hand, and I wrestled him back into the cage where he calmly went about the rest of his day and life.

Not a clue what was going on there, lol."
aww,It‚Äôs more like ‚Äúget me out of this bathtub!!!!‚Äù
aww,Is someone going to tell him it‚Äôs dead?
aww,Boxers and mastiffs have a high level of derp.  Frenchies replace most of the derp with cute.

aww,"The big breeds have shorter lives, so sad, they tend to have bad hearts.  Dog physiology is limited, they can get only so  big and the heart simply can't handle the load.  Has to do with the mitochondria of the heart muscles, if memory serves."

&amp;#x200B;

But in all seriousness, you're awesome for making sure the little bird was okay!"
aww,"Probably should have phrased it better. The owner volunteers theirs and the dogs time to do this.
Although I think the dog should be on a pay scheme. He could spend his money at the pet shop and buy himself toys."
aww,She trained you well üòä
aww,"I‚Äôm guessing that the relative sentience of the meat source makes drawing the line at cold blooded fish make sense for some folks.

aww,If I torture a dog is it all right as long as I eat all of it
aww,She insists on non-boring patches when they are changed
aww,Beautiful kitty and dope facial hair
aww,"I know all that. But I wasn't really serious so I apologise. They're cuddlier than crocs at least, and don't mean us any harm. Yeah, even with koalas, that everyone finds adorable, a person needs to be careful. They need to be picked up properly or they'll sink their teeth into the person."
aww,I have a very large sliding glass door. Basically it's the whole back wall of my house that opens the room up. Birds love to fly right into it sadly :( They're usually flying so fast they don't survive. This warmed my heart tho.
aww,"I was happy they had what looked like really lush grass to chomp on. Plus, they are outside on a beautiful day, hangin with their friends and trotting next to amiable humans. Happy cows! Maybe that's where that great Irish butter comes from?"
aww,"We think so. The left is learning to see at the same rate as the right, so the patch forces this to happen."
aww,Does that cat have only one front leg?
aww,"We are not, as much as I'd love one"

aww,"When physics don‚Äôt apply to her, gates don‚Äôt apply to her"
aww,Thanks! But no thanks.
aww,What breed is that?üòª
aww,"This reminds me of my Springer Spaniel/Lab mix.  What I didn't realize when I got her was that she was actually just part spring.  She hated being left alone and it wasn't long before she and I both discovered how easily she could clear our 6.5' side gate.  She also had no problem suddenly joining you in the middle of the pool on a hot day, going from sitting quietly by the edge to full flight in the blink of an eye.

edit: I found an old puppy pic.  [This](https://i.imgur.com/vUScEQT.jpg) is Snowy, wet from playing in the lawn sprinkler."
aww,I think that's a great name.
aww,"my rat terrier does this. there is no enclosure he can not conquer.

aww,Sweetie kittie!  What's her name??

aww,Yeah I‚Äôm pretty sure that gate doesn‚Äôt apply to her
aww,"Poor boy, at least he‚Äôs going to arrive now
*zooms out*
Oh fuck"
aww,"Considering the sheer rarity of being able to even get close to considered by a pro team in any of the main US/Canadian pro sports, that would be more than enough to make just about any family member cry in joy. Can't remember who did the video on it, I think it was Wendover, but there is a great video on YouTube that lists out the least likely things to happen to you, and in it he lists each of the pro sports in the US, and NHL I think was second or third least likely chances to make it there at all. The chances are almost insultingly low actually."
aww,... another Freaky Friday?
aww,"Sneak 100 

*Visibly confused*

Wait a minute!"
aww,"ugh boxers are such lovable, athletic, idiots"
aww,"The way I look at it: humans are social creatures, and that certainly hasn‚Äôt changed in your lifetime. If it takes a camera for someone to do something positive, then so what. Then compare that to someone legitimately complaining about it because it was shared to a public site. It‚Äôs ridiculous to me. I respect your opinion however as I can see you‚Äôve thought about it."
aww,"I‚Äôve tried that. Can confirm, not a good idea."
aww,"But have you seen what they look like outside of a shell when they don‚Äôt have a big enough shell to move into? Have you seen when they stress out and loose their limbs?? Super creepy!

Let‚Äôs not try and convince people they‚Äôre super cute fun pets. They are complicated and they‚Äôre part of that group of pets like betas that we think are ‚Äúsuper easy! Super small cages! It‚Äôs cheap!‚Äù

Edit: sorry wasn‚Äôt trying to attack OP Just re read this and realized it was sort of that way...but more like a general thing since that‚Äôs how they get sold typically."
aww,Awe! He's adorable. My cat is 17 and still acts like a kitten.
aww,"I've never seen them with a green plume, only white."
aww,"I'm just gonna go ask my husband to impregnate me, brb."

aww,"Holy cow. That is literally what happened to me. I had a brain tumor surgery that went poorly and caused a stroke, bleeding, and parts of my cerebellum was damaged. 

She is young and will heal. I woke up strapped to a hospital bed. Now I can walk and talk again. Also, my double vision improved a lot. I now it sounds silly, but I can see the computer monitor. I saw it better everyday and now I don‚Äôt need to wear my glasses with tape over a eye. 

I will leave you alone. I guess I just wanted to say that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Things still suck for me but they get better everyday 

Also, I know it‚Äôs taboo but cannabis did wonders for my strength and balance

Before my tumor I walked from Mexico to Canada on the pct, I was a lifty at DMR, I could do backflips off slack lines, I could spin ice sickles while I balanced them. I told myself

aww,"I had this happen to me a couple of years ago. A robin too! It was a lot younger. A fledgling. I‚Äôm assuming the mom died and the baby was starving, so it hopped over to me as I was walking by. I took it in, started feeding it mushy dog food, after about 3 weeks he was flying in and out of my house. I thought him how to hunt for worms out of the ground. Pretty cool. I should upload the video"

aww,"One day, a bird hit my back door and looked wounded and wouldnt fly away. I made it a little bed in a box and put out some food and water. I would visit him everytime i went out for a smoke, and just sit and chat to him(her/it?)
Over the next few days he got better and better, and eventually was able to start flying again. But he still came back to sleep and eat/drink...
One day i was sitting out there with him and a group of his birdie species were making a lot of noise by the tree about ten feet away. He started bouncing towards them and they looked at him weird and caw'ed at him. After a few seconds the goup took off. My bird friend looked over at me and caw'ed. Then he took off to join them...
Over the next few weeks,  random birds would land near me often. Sometimes i thought it was my guy, other times i was sure it wasnt. Maybe he told his friends i was cool or something :)
After a few weeks my bird encounters went back to normal.
I was and am still proud of my bird friend. I bet he was scared, but he trusted me and i hope he got to have a good life because of it"

Apparently, bird bones have to be denser because they're hollow, so birds don't actually weigh any less than they would if their bones weren't hollow."

Sometimes she tries to cat but it doesn't work. Generally, she cats at like a 10% level. But you give her a circle ball track under a chair where she can perch on the chair supports and hang her head upside down and she will circle ball track for an entire movie so you can't hear a thing."

aww,"Yeah birds are just nice tbh.  As long as it's a tame bird (i.e. it isn't biting you), just about the only downside to holding one is that it might shit on you.  But I've been shit on by a bird before and it's basically irrelevant, you can wipe off a fresh birdshit from clothes or furniture and it's like it was never even there (no smell either).  

Definitely hold/pet a bird at some point in your life."

aww,"RIP u/OofThisIsBad.

And now his watch has ended."
aww,"We adopted one from an acquaintance who got it for her kids. They kept it in a stupid enclosure and then promptly lost interest in it. 

We got it a real habitat with a proper humidity level and tried to give it a better life. He really liked homemade soup. At one point it burrowed into the coconut fiber/sand and didn't come up for months. I was sure it was dead, and then it popped up one day. We got it a collection of appropriate shells so that it could upgrade if it chose to, but it never did. 

One year we thought about taking it to the Jersey shore to set it free, but it was nearly autumn and we figured it'd be eaten in an instant (painted shell) if the cold didn't kill it first. We actually came across one in the wild on that trip, and regretted not bringing our little buddy for a few hours of freedom before a seagull carried him/her away.

To be honest I continually hoped it would die and often considered euthanasia. They're social creatures and it was living a pretty pathetic and pointless life. It lived way longer than I thought it would. When it finally seemed to have kicked the bucket, I put it in the freezer just to be sure.

Don't buy hermit crabs for your dumb kids."

aww,"I used to live next door to a dairy farm, and in good weather I liked to practice (badly) tai chi on my deck , which overlooked the farm.

We go to check on the kitchen and the panel was still up and her brother was upset bc he couldn't make the jump. I miss my pupper."

aww,"You can check if the mother rabbit is visiting or not by lightly laying a few small threads over the entrance to the hole and waiting a little over a day, then checking if the thread has been disturbed. 

The mother is likely still around, though. These babies are very young, which means if they had really gone ""a long time"" without receiving parental care they wouldn't still be alive. Since rabbits have a lot of predators, rabbits are very secretive about visiting their nests and don't visit very often, so the most likely scenario is that you just haven't witnessed the mother's visits. You should put the baby rabbits back in the nest. You could set up obstacles (deck chairs, etc.) to block the dogs but the rabbits will have their best chance in their own nest with their own mother.

Please read [this article](https://rabbit.org/faq-orphaned-baby-bunnies/), it has a lot of information for you that should be helpful."

But oh yeah.. It's more important that we humans breed fucked up dogs with too small skulls for the brains, breathing problems that we find cute rather than the well-being of the animal. I forgot."

New Zealand orca‚Äôs are rather fond of stingray/eagle ray wings. They have learnt that f they approach slowly from behind, the rays will raise their tail in warning rather than flee. One of the orcas can then grab the tail (they can‚Äôt sting you if you hold it by the tail) and flip it upside down, rendering it immobile. Then they bite off the wings and swim away in search of more rays."

aww,"Just wanted to add some things I learned while volunteering at a wildlife rehab center because there seem to be some lovely people in the comments willing to help animals! I‚Äôm not a vet or anything though and just learned this from volunteer training, so if anyone more knowledgeable has better information please feel free to correct me! 

- If you‚Äôre helping an animal, don‚Äôt talk to them at all. It can be soooo tempting because they are so cute, but no baby voice, no normal voice: nothing. This can lead to animals becoming desensitized to humans and not being scared of us - and them being scared of us can and often does save their lives. This is one of the #1 things that vets and vet techs working at the wildlife rehab center preach to people coming in, because often times they are talking in a baby voice to the animal and petting the animal thinking it‚Äôs helping to calm them, but it is not. The best thing you can do is secure the animal, let them be, and immediately take them to somewhere like a wildlife rehab center where they can get the care they need.
- Kinda going off that last bullet point, if you are holding a wild animal and it isn‚Äôt shaking, it is not because it is calm. It is terrified.
- If you have a case like a stunned bird and they don‚Äôt need serious intervention but just a safe space to recover, that shoebox idea above sounds like a great idea! Just make sure to release them where you found them, so they can find their way back to where they need to be. That is what they do at the rehab center, even if it means releasing the animal into someone‚Äôs backyard or driving a state away. 
- Where I live the weather is getting nicer and that means turtles (in my case, painted turtles and snapping turtles) are going to be having babies soon. This means returning to their nesting grounds - which can mean crossing roads and busy streets. If you are going to help them across the road (which you should, and thank you thank you to those that do), bring them to the side of the road they are trying to get to. Many people (myself included) make the mistake of bringing them to some pond or lake close by: do not do this. Turtles, from my understanding, have set nesting grounds and will go however far necessary to get there. Just help them with the crossing the road and let them be on their merry way! (P.s. grab snapping turtles from behind and make sure your hand is nowhere near their head; the rehab center let my mom and I (inexperienced volunteers) release a 15 lbs. rehabilitated snapping turtle that (if I remember correctly) can cut through bone - so it is possible to safely handle them. If in doubt, look up how to hold them.
- Squirrels, chipmunks, rats, mice, hamsters, rabbits and hares are not carriers of rabies and do not give rabies to humans. While they are wild animals and there is a chance of getting bitten, you shouldn‚Äôt need to worry about contracting rabies and should be safe to handle the animal and bring it to where it can be treated. My rehab center let‚Äôs people who have not be vaccinated for rabies volunteer in the squirrel room, and has a special crew with people who are vaccinated who take care of animals that are carriers.
- Baby ducks, goslings (baby geese), and especially baby swans can imprint on people. If you are dealing with an animal that imprints, please do everything in your power to avoid the animal imprinting! When we have a baby swan, we have to keep their box covered with netting and be extra silent because they are so prone to imprinting. 

Sorry for the essay; I just really love animals and want to make sure that if anyone else wishes to help them that you can do it in a way that helps the animal not just short term, but long term! A lot of these mistakes (like trying to calm an animal through petting and talking) are coming from a good place and I don‚Äôt want to discourage anyone from helping! And if it is worth anything, please know that this internet stranger really appreciates anyone who tries to help out our fellow creatures, and I personally want to thank you!! And if you are looking for other ways to help, volunteering is super rewarding, but if you don‚Äôt have time, (from my experience) wildlife rehab centers are always in need of things like towels, pillow cases, and boxes! So don‚Äôt toss, donate! If you have a local place, check with them to see what they need! 

Okay essay over. Again if you have any better insights, comment!

aww,Are there four dogs in this picture? Sorry only three.
aww,I can do this all day!
aww,I disagree... the most important thing is realizing that we don‚Äôt need to condemn millions of these very social and lovable creatures to our industrial slaughterhouses just to sustain ourselves. The way we get our meat is the farthest thing from natural.

aww,What a beautiful thing to be crying about at 3am!
aww,"No, no, no. Boxers and Mastiffs (all variations) ARE NOT bulldogs. They fall into the ""bully breed"" category ONLY because of their similar looks (pushed in noses and derpiness) and their shared ancestor. 

Boxers, bull mastiffs (and other mastiff variations), bulldogs, French bulldogs and any other dog with a short/mushed nose form the breed group know as Brachycephalic breeds.
In cats, the Persian is also Brachycephalic.

French bulldogs are a variation of the English Bulldog which have been developed over time to be smaller and have upright ears. They are a stand alone breed. Not just a smaller version on the English Bulldog. They were also bred for different purposes than the English Bulldog (who, in the current state, could never perform its original function). 

Also, boxers and bull mastiff look similar in some aspects. But they do not look remotely the same. For starters, a bull mastiff is 2 to 3 times heavier than a boxer and are larger in shape.

I'm enjoying the incredibly cute faces of all three of these babies looking longingly at their parent waiting for the food, that is clearly for them, which will be dropped and demolished by the trio of slobber monsters."
aww,Enjoy it now... That little fucker will be an asshole in no time!
aww,She is not mine! Found her pictures on the world wide web. I would break in her hoomans house just to give her a stroke
aww,What the fuck it‚Äôs a cat dude
aww,https://imgur.com/gallery/PYb1SCZ here‚Äôs a video of one of my crabs changing shells. For a crab to be out of it‚Äôs shell for any extended period of time means it‚Äôs extremely stressed and will die if it doesn‚Äôt get shelled again soon.

aww,"How and where do you get private insurance for this? Additionally, have you taken animal first aid/cpr courses? Before my current job i was looking into rover/normal dog walking and sitting. 

Would be nice to do this if i knew it'd pay decently for a college student."
aww,"Gawd they have been thumping a lot this spring. I should find some kind of nice fake stained glass window thing to stick onto the sliding glass door. 

On the flip side though it defeats the purpose of the door and watching the birds through it."
aww,Save me from the wee turtles!
aww,"Munchkins are a genetic mutation that came about spontaneously. Munchkins can only breed with non-munchkins, because Munchkins bred together produce dead kittens."

aww,"Munchkins are a spontaneous genetic mutation and they must be bred with a regular cat, because two munchkins reproduce dead kittens.

aww,"Gawd my sister and I made a few very ugly plasticky glue ""stained glass"" things that you put on the doors and it was horrible. the art was ugly and they were impossible to get off the door in one piece or move around. It was so nice once we finally picked them off. They stayed on the doors for wayyy too long."
aww,This kitten reminds me of a fluffier version of my cat when she was younger &lt;3 So cute!!

aww,"""You seeing this shit?"""
aww,"I know with dogs if you lightly stroke that area between their eyes, from bottom by nose to forehead, they will typically start to fall asleep. The mother dogs use this trick to put their pups to sleep."
aww,"I'm so jealous of pet owners whose pets just want to be.....pet.

I have the sweetest funniest most beautiful pitbull mix. An extreme onslaught of love and playfulness.

That said, and many un-fixed male pitbull owners will tell you they only want to be pet when you ain't with it 

Come home and say hi and go in for a pet and kiss? Nope. Runs away and brings me a toy 

Chilling next to me on the couch watching TV? Go for a pet....perks up and runs and grabs a toy

Pets while asleep? K now I'm up time to go get a toy.

The worst? You try to play and they won't give you the fucking toy either.

So you go on Reddit or look at the TV

Look down five seconds later there's a toy on your lap and a dog staring you down until you throw it.

I literally only get to pet my dog when he thinks he's getting table food or when he's tired of playing (play time usually goes midnight til maybe 6am depending how drunk I am, which makes me equally chase him around playing

Cutest freakin dog I swear he let's me pet him 5 minutes a day"
aww,"&gt; for some reason

LOL. I heard of a marine lab that had crabs go missing at night. Eventually figured out that an octopus in a room down the hall had learned to climb out of his tank, squeeze under the door and nip on down to the crab room for a snack and then climb back into his tank."

aww,They dont realy count as cute if you cant make them giant and have them still be cute.
aww,Exactly i think she is enjoying a lot.
aww,"Oi, you got a loicense for recording that mate?"
aww,Yesss! Let‚Äôs go on a road trip
aww,"Your writing style is hilarious. You don‚Äôt sound old, you sound intelligent and experienced; I think that‚Äôs what they meant :) I actually thought you were the young man in the pic."
aww,Mods please block these spam bots!!!!
aww,Holy Crap I went to sleep and this blew up. And I got my first gold! Thank you all so much Dani‚Äôs mom is gonna be so happy when I show her!
aww,"I've eaten meat all my life but I've struggled with it at times when I see videos like this. Whenever possible, I usually buy meat when its on a clearance sale because its approaching the use by date, otherwise its very likely to just get thrown in the garbage the following day anyway, even despite still being perfectly fine for consumption for at least another day or so. The amount of perfectly good meat that stores throw away while it's still edible is really disturbing."
aww,"The problem isn‚Äôt the breeding itself though. It‚Äôs the perceived quality of life of the animal. 

If its quality of life is significantly lower just so you can have a cat that‚Äôs slightly cuter it‚Äôs seen as a bad thing."
aww,Now u go throw it
aww,The lab is confused
aww,That remote obviously had it coming
aww,He also loves the bath.   I think I adopted a dog.

Bravo!"
aww,She thinks they're more of a suggestion!
aww,Hind legs are like sprints. SPRONGGGG!
aww,"They're suspected to have more health problems, but study since the mid 90s hasn't really shown them to be any worse off than any other non-Munchkin"
aww, That is the biggest dog I've ever seen. It must be really fun to ply with. But a nightmare to wash and keep clean.
aww,I think the intended meaning is that you shouldn‚Äôt sleep *instead of seeking immediate medical attention*
aww,Did they tell you I came with the deal? I want this cat in my life.
aww,"It's quality of life, from what I've seen, is pretty good. They can have spinal problems and hollow chest issues, but the same can happen to humans with similar genetic dwarfism."
aww,That little bit of pink paws is so perfectly cute!
aww,That's so cute. Oh my goodness.
aww,Aww so cute! His name is Cheese
aww,Was scrolling looking for this comment
aww,"I feel like this is fake, or real but with the stick itself made bigger. There were two other popular gifs just like this - dogs carrying sticks that seemed WAAAY too big for them to be carrying and they were both proven to be CGI. This looks *incredibly* similar to those videos, wouldn‚Äôt be surprising to find out if this was made by the same person. Still, they‚Äôre getting better, this one was a lot more realistic!! (the first had the stick dip into the ground, every one this far has been an improvement)"
aww,"Looking cute, don't delete later!"
aww,I‚Äôm guessing the first ‚Äòsad‚Äô dog is female and the goofy ‚Äòjealous‚Äô dog is male.

aww,What a cute sleepy little blep
aww,Except they did survive in the wild.  For at least 40 years before a stray and her litter of Munchkins and non-Munchkins were found in the mid-80s
aww,"I loved my hermit crabs but after having to rehome them for a move I decided not to get anymore. The kiosks and pet stores sell them in painted, sometimes toxic shells. Like someone else said, they're usually in the wrong type of habitat; they need humidity and warmth and proper burrowing materials. It's a lot of work to maintain them well and I don't think someone buying them on a whim from a kiosk is going to put in the proper amount of work to take care of them. And the biggest factor is that they can't reproduce in captivity. Ever. They are never secure enough and feel safe enough in captivity to be able to reproduce. I don't think it's fair to keep an animal that will constantly be stressed out. I really miss having my babies though and think about them a lot but I feel like its better to not have any."
aww,Sinks should be measured in kitties. This would be a 4 kitty sink.

aww,Have you seen them when 8 or 9 line up in a row in order of size and all trade up to a larger shell? It is very efficient and rather charming

aww,What's your go to fish to eat? I really enjoy Salmon.
aww,Cat's coat looks like carpet
aww,"I find it intellectually tantalizing that we find the young of OTHER SPECIES to be more cute and adorable than our own.

A human baby?  They're loud, obnoxious, expensive, shit everywhere, annoying as hell.

But then you think of baby crocodiles.  Puppies.  Lambs. Kittens.  Bunnies.  And a sense of ""AWWWWWW"" comes over you.

Kind of messed up when you think about it."
aww,"Every time I watch a video of an animal my cat gets worried and goes looking for it. I show him my phone and that it's where the sound is coming from but he always goes in search of it because it's obviously in another room. 

I watched a video of someone playing a flute and he freaked out. He's special."
aww,"It's a bit more difficult when you life with a none-veggie who does all the cooking

Your mention of salt licks reminds me of a school trip I went on in the mid 90s. One of our stops was a salt mine, where we had the opportunity to take a sample of huge salt crystals and also run up the enormous salt mountains. The teachers were sure to encourage us to *not* wash our hands after this.

&amp;#x200B;

It turns out that was some strategic planning, because the next trip was a dairy farm. A group of 100 kids got off the bus with hands in the air to avoid touching anything, for whatever surprise awaited us. We were promptly ushered into a pen with calves and instructed to hold out our hands. Much to our delight, the little baby cows quickly latched onto our salty fingers and went to town like brand-new Hoovers.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a memorable experience."

aww,"Again, I disagree... the mass consumption of meat is extremely taxing to our environment and health. There‚Äôs a lot to say about the ethical treatment of animals, and I respect the shit out of people who give up animals products for the consideration of animals, but the most convincing statistics that swayed me relate directly to the immense scale of the animal food production industry. Our consumption of meat leads to an insane amount of water usage, emissions, and environmental pollutants that come from farms, slaughterhouses, packaging facilities, and means of transport. When our mass consumption creates a demand for cheap, accessible meat for every meal of the day, we‚Äôre left with a ton of consequences that have negatively impacted our environment and personal health."

One got away the first night, I found him on the other side of the house. They did live about a year but it was trial and error and I made many mistakes. Years later I saw a massive one (size of a baseball) trapped in a lonely cage all by itself. 

While they are fascinating creatures to observe I don't think they should be pets unless you know a great deal about crustaceans and have the time and desire to give them the home their unique requirements demands."

I live in a place where horses are king and everywhere is plastered with fences mimicking the farms. The dog parks do have chicken wire around the decorative fencing so small dogs can get through so it‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be a problem... right? Well not at all. I brought my pup into the park and went back out of the gate to grab my phone literally twenty feet away. I got to my car and she jumped into the car all happy and excited.

aww,"I am very floofy

And sort-of old, too

I been here a while

Gots nothin' to do

I spend most my days

Layin' behind bars

Can't see any trees

Can't see any stars

The people walk by

And don't pay me mind

They see younger kitties

They treat them more kind

Got no one to love me

Got no one to say

""Oh hey big guy! 

Let's go home today!""

Until one morning

A nice lady came

She saw my old face

She called me by name

She opened my cage

And petted my face

She made me feel happy

In this old scary place

She held up her phone

She said, ""Buddy, pose!""

So I did my best look

I nom nommed the nose

She laughed and she smiled

And sent picture to friend

He said I ""looked cute""

And that was the end

She got so excited 

She scooped me right up

She took me home

She gave me big love

And now every day

I no more see bars

I see flying birds

And fast moving cars

The window is now

My favorite place

To wait till the evening

To see her nice face

As she opens her car door

And yells really loud

""Hey, Buddy! I'm home!""

It's my favorite sound

And when she comes in

I stretch out my toes

She gives me a kiss

And I nom nom her nose."

aww,Reddit believes munchkin cats are super deformed and must be sick and in pain all the time. They are one of healthier breeds because you cant breed 2 munchkins together so the breed is constantly being cross breeded with cats of different breeds.

I have friends in big cat conservation and one who legit traveled to the jungles for years to track tiger movement and has joined many others to securing strict rules of ‚Äúowning‚Äù big cats to governments and the outcome of a lot of these big cats are horrendous. Not to mention the truth about white tigers and I wonder how many unwanted tigers were tossed aside just so the white ones can sell at a higher price. It‚Äôs truly sad. 

You and I may be passionate about the conservation and the perseverance of tigers but a lot do not. I upvoted you because I feel the same as you.

Now after having this hilariously always hungry dude around for the past 4 yrs I can definitely attest to at least him living up to those rankings.  Has got to be up on the list of one of the cleverest dogs I've ever been around, maybe they get that rap because sometimes he'll give you that look when your telling him something, knowing full well he shouldn't do it and he still does it.

Depending on the birds you're banding, you might also have cage traps around feeders or for raptors a bait pigeon in a cage surrounded by nets. (The pigeon is fine! They're protected from hawks in their cage and just chill there all day.)"

aww,I don't know why more cats aren't bread makers.
aww,"Well hello there. Lets have a disscussion on the sources used to reach our respective conclusions.

My belief is that they are unhealthy and should not be supported by anyone: https://www.ufaw.org.uk/cats/munchkin-limb-deformity

The source is trustworthy with links to researches done, and also declaration by many societies not to acknowledge munchkin as a breed.

aww,"1.3 billion cows take up 23% of land mass on earth, the methane they produce is one of the foremost polluters of the planet and cause for climate change, agreed. 
We wouldn‚Äôt need to slit the throats of cows who are only creating a problem because of the scale we breed them to be eaten, it‚Äôs not really their fault is it. They have feelings and emotions and mothers and children, they just want to live. 

Like you say becoming veggie is the best way to save our planet (methane has a shelf life of 9 years so we could still make the 11 year breaking point with climate change) but what got us into the problem in the first place is losing touch of morality and forgetting that we should be caretakers of the earth and its inhabitants and not the exploiters who deny rights to sentient beings."
aww,It‚Äôs a Willy Wagtail I think

aww,"&gt; Our lab once brought home a cooked ham with only the one set of toothmarks on it. She was so proud of herself! My father couldn't find the owners (looking back, I'm not sure he tried that hard), so Candy got the sliced up, marked section, and we ate the rest.

You ate a ham your dog dragged in from somewhere?"
aww,Do you have a source for methane shelf life?
aww,"&gt; They probably thought you were ~~adorable~~ carrying breakfast

Edit: forgot a word, and changed the entire sentence"
aww,"Maybe it was just our neighbourhood, but there were 4 dogs including ours. Big neighbourhood but only a few houses, the road hadn‚Äôt even been paved yet so there were rarely any cars around. Very out of the way so any cars there weren‚Äôt just passing by. Not to mention half of the land was covered by bush land. 

Most of my friends have similar stories about free roam dogs, I‚Äôm sensing it‚Äôs an Australian thing. Kind of phased out in the late 90‚Äôs but in rural areas there are still towns where people keep dog bowls out for ‚Äúneighbourhood dogs‚Äù, which are dogs that free roam and even though they have owners, everyone loves them and feeds them and plays with them around town."

aww,"&gt;humans are capable of providing small good deeds to balance out the bad ones.  If humans can run over animals in their cars, I don‚Äôt see why we shouldn‚Äôt also use our power to prevent unnecessary suffering where we can.

aww,You must be really good cat-parents if he trust you that much:)
aww,"As someone whose parents got me one because I apparently wasn't responsible enough for a dog, this is true."
aww,"I had a similar incident as an adult. A hummingbird flew into my office window and knocked itself silly. I tucked it into an empty tissue box and gave it a quiet corner to rest in. I read up on how to help him perk up (when he was found it was hot af outside) and made him some sugar water. I fed him with a straw but he looked pretty dehydrated and perhaps like he was choking on something. In an attempt to save him, I tried to pull a thin, brown stick out of his beak. After several unsuccessful tries I realized it was his tongue.

I eventually got him rehydrated and off flying again but boy, I felt dumb. Poor bird was probably thinking, ""Ack! Stop yanking on my tongue, stupid!"""

aww,"It‚Äôs more the squatting and turning. I saw him look at the other one briefly, but you have no idea how quick they are!

...naturally there were other people there to warn him (like the camera guy) and they‚Äôre socialized tigers, but still makes me cringe knowing"
aww,"He was.  His name was Dia (Day in Spanish) Lost my other baby (Noche - Night in Spanish) 10 days before losing Dee so was a double blow! They were my children, since I don‚Äôt have any human ones, so they were loved beyond measure. I don‚Äôt get how people can call them ‚Äòjust dogs‚Äô.  Dogs have the most amazing souls and you are sooo right, they recover/get over things much faster, and we can learn a lot from them.. especially unconditional love.  Happy Belated Birthday to Joey.

aww,So cute!  Be careful.  Raccoons can carry rabies without showing signs.
aww,"I'm about 99% sure that both of those videos you were talking about are not CGI. I'd analysed them pretty well and the amount of work that'd have to go into them would have been crazy. It take a lot of time and effort to make something like this if it were to be fake, and i'd found nothing that would indicate it to particularity be fake either. Also, it's not unreasonable for a dog to be carrying a large stick. Though if you can find any material that talks about how it was made or a breakdown of the VFX, i'd love to see it."
aww,"Awww... I had a kitten named Zelda that I adopted from a shelter. She was born with a parasite in her brain (contracted from her mom in utero) and only lived to 7 months, but I loved her so much and she was the sweetest little thing. At the end, she wasn't able to walk or eat, but she purred in my arms while the vet helped her fall asleep forever. I may have only had her a few months, but they were wonderful months. May your Zelda be the light in your day and live a long, happy, and playful life."

aww,Cat's never look where you point.   It's annoying.
aww,I wouldn't do this to a cat but what's the main reason not to? Bad for them to have too short a coat with certain breeds or something? Odd balance?  I've never seen a grooming that short other than small areas for surgeries.
aww,&gt; Malamutes have several coat types but only one is the correct breed standard. ... Sometimes a recessive gene pops up in a litter and it can produce a long coat Malamute or a woolly Malamute

aww,"The stillborn effect requires homozygous genotypes. The munchkin gene paired with a normal gene would not be homozygous unless the normal cat is actually a heterozygous carrier. That could happen since the cat would be normal height and so humans wouldn't be able to know that. However the chances of that are relatively slim at the breed's current population size.

aww,I've always wanted to say this. I knew two guys at school who I swear looked exactly like Growlithe and Arcanine to each other. I don't think they ever really knew each other because they were a year level apart and I didn't know anyone who knew both of them.

aww,"My Jack Russell and I (or my Dad) used to do this all the time in the evening or when it was raining. Our staircase was much longer though, so the ball would hit several steps on its way down. We would aim to hit the landing wall, so that it would bounce down the upstairs corridor, Sugzy would then fetch it, and chew it, then drop it down the stairs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally we completely wrecked the back wall (it needed repainting quite often) but it kept the dog happy, so that's all that matters."

aww,"False. Dogs are like kids. They are what you train them to be. Labs are great at learning. They excel at retrieving (obviously), and also as service dogs. The numbers might show that a lot are untrained, ""short on brains"" dogs, but that's likely because they're one of the most popular house dog breeds, and most people don't take the time they should training their house dog. Saying labs are short on brains is the same as saying all pit bulls are man-eaters. 9/10 the human is to blame for the dog's behavior.

aww,"Willy Wagtails are cheeky buggers. We had a real fat one that used to follow us around the garden and eat all the bugs as we kicked the grass or dug through the garden. If you dug the compost you had to be careful not to bury him and walking around could be a real hazard as he liked to come sit on your feet to be closer to the bugs so there was a real risk of accidentally stepping on him. 

This guys strategy worked a little too well, as he became definitely way too chonky to fly properly and he got whacked by a brown falcon one day while we were watching. But then, after that we had an amazing looking brown falcon hovering meters above our head for a few weeks, looking for more chonky birbs to snack on, so it was hard to be too sad."

NB: Shearing an animal's coat that doesn't usually get shorn can be problematic if it's cut too short as that can lead to ingrown hairs and sunburns if exposed.

ETA: for those asking, a lion cut is usually used on cats whose fur tends to mat."
aww,"Those babies are going to die, when they didn‚Äôt have to. Look at the baby. It‚Äôs not dehydrated. Mama has been visiting. 

We had a nest of babies in our backyard last year and set up a wildlife camera to watch. Mama came back every day or two, either at 5am or right when it got dark. 

When she hadn‚Äôt visited for two days I called a wildlife rehabber and asked what to do and she said **even with professional wildlife rehabilitation, babies that young are so sensitive, they only have a 10% chance of survival**. 

If you think there‚Äôs a chance dogs will get them, put a weighted laundry basket over the nest so that only mama can get in.

We got one of those automatic ball throwers for our dog.

The gotcha with these things is training the dog to drop the ball back in the thrower; our dog is quite bright, and I'm pretty sure he figured out that once he could do it, we wouldn't be throwing the ball for him any more....and considering ball throwing is someone dogs want to do *with you*, I really should have figured that out sooner.

aww,"In general I think this represents poor animal welfare (AW). AW can be hard to define, [The Five Freedoms](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_freedoms) , developed to help protect farmed animals &amp; promote their better welfare, can be adapted to help guide us when it comes to animals kept as pets.

In this context, I‚Äôd be concerned about 2 &amp; 5 specifically. I readily appreciate that for some cats, clipping parts of the fur might be needed due to matting (because the cat cannot reach those areas or just isn‚Äôt motivated to do so) and yes, surgery will require a close shave of the surgical site &amp; a sizeable area surrounding it.

I doubt that either applies in this case, I think this has probably been done for ‚Äúlaughs‚Äù and social media ‚Äúlikes‚Äù. I feel the same about dyeing Poodles / similar breeds and some of the less functional clips that many poor dogs are subject to.

By now, you‚Äôve probably guessed that I‚Äôm also not a fan of the extreme breeding that has brought about [brachycephalic breeds](https://www.bva.co.uk/news-campaigns-and-policy/policy/companion-animals/brachycephalic-dogs/) etc

The clipping of cats &amp; dogs should be reserved for necessity and should be done for their benefit, in a way that does not curtail their welfare. The cat depicted here will have been subjected to a lengthy &amp; distressing clipping session and will be unable to groom normally for some while, until the fur grows back.

They love being loved and protected.  Just set rules, no outside.  No, never!  And keep them forever.

My money is on this being some rich dude or a less than reputable ""rescue"" or something. Sorry to be a downer. That career path definitely exists, but not like this."
aww,So you want to teach the tiger that breaking it open and eating the inside is better.  I don't see how that lesson could ever go wrong.
aww,Happy birthday! You look like a tiny bear!
aww,Thank you!  I needed this in my life!
aww,"I wouldnt be so sure. My gramps lives in Alaska and his back porch/dock looks exactly like this, and so does all of his ""neighbors"" (way spread out) back yards, whales and everything. It's a 4 bed 2 and a half bath at 7200 square feet. He bought his house 4 years ago for 240,000. Granted there is pretty much nothing, in terms of civilization, surrounding it. But compare that to where I live and for 450,000 you can have a nice view of the side of your neighbors house."
aww,Yeah that was bugging me too so I eventually moved it. He‚Äôs messy and leaves his toys all over the house.
aww,"llab - i think i'm gonna sit here in front of the fence, nothing weird will happen here

aww,CA has populations of wild sea lions + highways that are mere feet from the ocean. Sea lions are [insanely smart](http://discovermagazine.com/1993/feb/riothelogicalsea184) and curious animals so stuff like this happens.

aww,Seems like he should pivot forward on his front paws
aww,I'm not so scared anymore after the growling that morning lol as it is I'll let her continue her shenanigans and keep visiting her friends. There's an old vet across the street that she visits. He hates animals but he's taken to her and let's her come in to roll around. Now he gets mad at his nurses if a new one tries to chase her out. Cat's are special.
aww,Peach. Caramel. Orange Creamsicle.
aww,I heard a tiny little birdie squeak at the end.

aww,Is this really a 'bengal' tiger?
aww,"No bite, only lick"
aww,"Actually my dog is the same way with apples. He doesn't ""get"" that he can bite into it so he will lick until he gets bored and gives up. I have to show him he can bite it, then he loves it and gobbles it up."
aww,Too adorable ... totally made my day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüñ§üñ§
aww,"""Loosely translated from Meows"""

aww,I hope one day that we can use the power of science to make sure this dude's descendents will be licking a watermelons on mars.
aww,"One time at the beach I opened up the beach umbrella and there were hundreds of ladybugs under the canopy. It must have been mating season. A whole bunch fell on me, and ladybugs are probably the only insects that could get away with that without driving me totally insane. We tried to move but the other umbrellas were infested as well."
aww,Paw to door service!
aww,I was fully expecting a boot to come in at the end
aww,My GF actually was worried about that exact thing whenever we were looking at one. Dogs really want us every bit as much as the ball.

aww,"I'm not so convinced. After all, mammals or birds have one distinct but *massive* advantage over octopi. Both raise their offspring, and often have sort of cultures. They are able to pass on ideas and skills and such, wheras octopi are on their own when they hatch. Often their mother guards the eggs but dies shortly before they hatch. Then again, with how intelligent octopi are, imagine if they did raise their young!"

aww,"Okay, but what did you get them?"
aww,"I used to follow this guy on Instagram (only stopped due to the frequency of posts were a bit too much for how often I actually check it - feed was always full of his stuff), but as far as I can tell he does legit conservation work with protecting these animals, I think a lot of them are with him from birth/ very early age so they aren't aggressive around him. I could be proved wrong though.

 I do think live and let live would be best implemented by getting people to really think about what they eat in order for humanity to live and let animals live. It‚Äôs difficult trying to think of eating animals and their products as a choice because the choice is still being denied by the animals. I‚Äôm definitely trying my best to learn how to be active to help the animals by engaging people in conversations without making people feel like I‚Äôm judging them.

A lion or a tiger *can* lick your skin off, because their tongue is covered in sharp barbs. But it is incorrect - and an extremely common misunderstanding spread throughout the internet - that they will flay the skin from your arm just by licking you affectionately.



An analogy to a panterine's tongue would be like sand paper. If you were to scrub at someone's skin in a sustained fashion with sandpaper, you would eventually rub their skin off. But if you just rub it briefly, you'll just graze them."

aww,Why didnt you show the other one? Does someone have favourites?

aww,"I‚Äôm so sorry for that. It‚Äôs obvious you do care for animals and love them. My whole life I‚Äôve always loved animals so much, even when I ate them, it‚Äôs a difficult thing for me to make sense of looking back. What I know for sure is that love will always conquer hate. Often the hate you may receive may come from a side effect of love for the animals, but love for animals should never result in hate for humans. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs acceptable for people to make you feel so horrible, all humans should be working together as a team to navigate our way through this life and try to minimise suffering for all animals, humans included.
I‚Äôm sorry for waffling, I really want you to know that I don‚Äôt come from a place of judgment, I‚Äôm trying to connect with you in a place of compassion"

aww,"Yesterday on one of our long training walks, my 7yr old rescued Labradane was super focused the whole time! That is, until we saw some ducks on a hill leading to a pond. I had to choose between being dragged into the water or letting her fall in the pond. She ended up swimming after the ducks. It is so hard to be mad at her when I know she absolutely loved it."

aww,thank you so much for the kind words :D
aww,"I do this, too. My dog would get super jealous if I paid any attention to my cat. She would nip at him until he felt threatened and left and then try to get me to pet her. I always pushed her out of the way and went to the cat saying did that bad dog scare you and continue on. Over time, this taught the dog that she will not get any attention from doing that. Now she will come sit by me and wait her turn. Or I'll pet one with one had and one with the other."

aww,"Alright, I know this is stupid of me, but since you seem to know a thing or two I'm responding to you so you can tell me why this is stupid of me so here goes. I get that cats aren't tigers but I was always told that cats are solitary animals and yet my cat loves the ever living shit out of me and follows me around everywhere, actively desiring my company over other options. That said, I've had her since she was a kitten. So all I'm saying is, how sure are we that tigers don't like being around maybe one or two other tigers and maybe a person who raised it?"

aww,"No, they're not. They're obligate carnivores. Dogs are capable of eating, and even digesting in some cases, plant material. But that doesn't change the fact that everything about their teeth and digestive system aligns with being a carnivore.


Although, although they do have the ability to eat plant material in small quantities, that doesn't qualify them as a true omnivore. If someone has told you that dogs are omnivores, you've been lied to."

aww,Or... a laser pointer works too!
aww,"This reminds me a story that still makes my blood boil every time  I think of it. 

About three years ago I went to a white elephant Christmas party at my girlfriend's job. When it was my turn to pick out a gift I choose this sweet looking box with a picture of a pizza slice on it...cause ya know, I like pizza.

I open the box to find a goddamn Red-Eared Slider just sitting in a cardboard box with nothing but a wet napkin. This dumbass girl who brought it was like ""His name is Michelangelo and don't worry! I included a care sheet from Petco!"". Except it wasn't a care sheet, it was a pamphlet about the risks of not washing your hands after holding the turtle or something that was equally useless. The gift including nothing else, and the poor little guy had been sitting in that box for hours.

Of course, after I opened it no one wanted to steal it, even the girl who brought it was like ""hell no I don't want a turtle LOL!"". We had all been drinking so most of my inhibitions were gone at that point, so I said to her ""What the hell is wrong with you. Who brings a live animal to a gift exchange"". She just didn't respond and her big boyfriend got all offended that I insulted his girlfriend.

Anyways, she clearly would've just dumped him on the side of the road if I tried to make her take it back, and frankly I didn't like the idea of Petco selling it to some other idiot so I kept him. Immediately afterwards we went straight to Wal-Mart where I proceeded to drunkenly buy a full tank set up for this little guy and then stayed up until like 4:00am trying to get it all set up.

Many studies have been done showing dogs do not need meat to survive because they can digest many fruit and vegetables and thrive only on that diet.

Whilst dogs are not ‚Äòtrue‚Äô omnivores in the way bears and humans are, they still are perfectly capable of eating an digesting plant material but with a preference for meat. They can be considered omnivores or carnivores depending on your definitions. The term ‚Äòobligate carnivore‚Äô, however, does not mean any animal that prefers meat, it means animals that are physiologically incapable of digesting plant matter such as axolotls and cats."

If you like Luna you could rename him something like ""Lunar"" and just call him by the nickname ""loon"" (then it can be a homage to both names!)

It kinda worked, but obviously we won in the end.  

It's been a fun campaign so far."

aww,"You've misread. On one occasion it burrowed and presumably molted. When it died, it was on the surface, didn't move for days, and started to stink. 

That's absolutely incorrect that they aren't high maintenance. Don't give people that impression. They need a proper habitat with the correct medium to burrow, with temperature and humidity at the right level so they don't struggle to breathe. The medium needs to be regularly thrown out and replaced or baked in an oven to sterilize it.

This guy was bought at the shore and kept in a tiny novelty bird cage-like thing with a thin layer of pebbles and shells as a medium for six months to a year, in a dry, sometimes cold apartment where it likely couldn't breathe properly. It had a painted, possibly toxic shell. This wasn't a hermit crab from an ethical pet store. It was bought and sold as novelty trash. Expecting it to live a long, healthy life after that kind of start is fucking stupid. Get fucked."

It's a gel made of volcanic ash. You use a really tiny amount and it's extremely sticky. Then it dries out completely and leaves your hair how you styled it, matte, and completely touchable (not crispy or sticky or greasy at all). The stuff is magic."

aww,"That's what everybody is telling me. Happens everytime I foster. It's really easy to fall in love with all of them.

The thing is, this guy has a lot of energy and I think he'd do well with some animal friends. He'll have two cat siblings, two dog siblings, and three humans to look after him. I live alone with no pets, so when I'm gone he's bored and gets crazy rambunctious.

Also, someone fell in love with him and wanted him. I'd like to consider myself a purveyor of fine kittens. My perspective is that there are a million other cats/kittens in the world that I can love just as easily. So if someone has space in their home and heart for Kitten Boy, that's fine, I'll just wait for the next one.

For what it's worth, he's staying in the family. One of my friends fell for his sweet face and fuzzy tum so I'll get updates and visits pretty often."

aww,Just like my teacher looks cool but is actually very toxic
aww,Probably a mixture of having naturally thick hair + pomade. Im not sure without having already thick hair you could do this. Parting your hair on the opposite side from where you normally do it before applying pomade might help though.

aww,"# for those who don't get the reference

Seems there was a treasure ship on its way back to port.  About 
halfway there, it was approached by a pirate, skull and crossbones waving 
in the breeze!

	""Captain, captain, what do we do?"" asked the first mate.  

	""First mate,"" said the captain, ""go to my cabin, open my sea 
chest, and bring me my red shirt.""  The first mate did so. 

	Wearing his bright red shirt, the captain exhorted his crew to 
fight.  So inspiring was he, in fact, that the pirate ship was repelled 
without casualties.  

	A few days later, the ship was again approached, this time by two 
pirate sloops!  

	""Captain, captain, what should we do?""

	""First mate, bring me my red shirt!""

	The crew, emboldened by their fearless captain, fought heroically, and 
managed to defeat both boarding parties, though they took many 
casualties.  That night, the survivors had a great celebration.  The 
first mate asked the captain the secret of his bright red shirt. 

	""It's simple, first mate.  If I am wounded, the blood does not 
show, and the crew continues to fight without fear.""

	A week passed, and they were nearing their home port, when 
suddenly the lookout cried that ten ships of the enemy's armada were 
approaching!  

	""Captain, captain, we're in terrible trouble, what do we do?""  
The first mate looked expectantly at the miracle worker. 

	Pale with fear, the captain commanded, ""First mate.... bring me my
brown pants!"""

aww,"When I was a kid our family cat left for quite some time.  He had been a street cat before so he did spend time outside, and we thought maybe he got hurt and died out there.  After months or years, he returned, and we welcomed him back.  A neighbor stopped over one day and was surprised to see her cat with us.  We laughed and told her he had been ours and had returned to us after all this time.  I don't know if she was mad or anything, but this was the kind of cat that chose us, not that we chose him.  He came and went as he pleased.

Anyway, when the cat did die, he died in our home.  He was laying down with his head up, and his legs tucked neatly under him, below our dining table.  It was an honor."

They also can't process sugar the same way we do, which makes them very prone to diabetes if fed diets high in sugar or carbohydrates (like most mainstream kibble)."

aww,"Sometimes the mothers die. Sometimes the mothers reject the lambs, which can‚Äôt be explained, but it does happen. Sometimes there are multiple births and the mother can‚Äôt handle it. Sometimes the mother‚Äôs milk doesn‚Äôt come down. There are many medical reasons why the ewes can‚Äôt care for their lambs, just like humans. 

So the farmers, to ensure no lamb is left behind, will take the orphan lambs and hand-feed them to ensure that they grow up healthy. The farmers should be commended for trying to nurture every life they are responsible for, and to do the best for their livestock, not condemned by people who don‚Äôt understand animal husbandry and are ignorant of farming."

I also know people with FAKE service animals ARE an issue. 
I was saying it shouldn‚Äôt be any issue as long as a person truly is DISABLED and a health PROFESSIONAL has given APPROVAL for it. There shouldn‚Äôt be a question of ‚Äúwell I just think you should get an ESA‚Äù when a doctor has told someone with a disability that use of a service animal would be helpful.

A random person without a disability, with a poorly trained dog, being an asshole is a problem. Someone with a disability with a well trained service dog whom a doctor has approved is not a problem. 

Idk how you twisted my original reply around to mean that random people with FAKE service animals are perfectly fine but okay...sorry for any misunderstanding"

aww,"2 cups of warm water, dissolve 1 and a half table spoons of yeast with 1 tablespoon of sugar and salt. Add 5 to 6 cups of flours slowly into the mixture, constantly mixing it. Knead for 15 minutes or longer, adding more water or flour when it gets too dry or wet. Once fully kneaded and even , not sticking to surfaces, put in a bowl in a warmish place (Kalahari sunshine) and put wet dish cloth over it. Let it be for 2 or more hours (I did 3 Nd a half) until it has doubled in size. Knead it again and form them into cats, cutting with scissors for ears. Let them set for 10 minutes, then put them in the oven for 2 hours or until golden brown. For a glaze, you can use a mixture of even amounts of honey and butter. Using a tooth pick and food colouring, you can add the whiskers and faces.

Edit: Oven at 180¬∞C (350¬∞F).  You can also put a tray of water in the bottom of the oven, helps make them crispy and hold their shape."
aww,"True, it‚Äôs just a very small minority of males can have s mutation causing them to be able to be calico"
aww,Old pupper boxy needs treats and scritches.

aww,"Yeah, looks like that ‚Äúfelting‚Äù technique?"
aww,She looks like she‚Äôs on spring break üòÜ
aww,"actually, the same innervation exists in most mammals just the placement is slightly varied, even humans. Rubbing the temples and stroking the ears releases many of the same endorphins. Works on horses like a charm as well, ever seen a 1000+lb animal melt into butter?"

aww,"Not a cat, but my dog ran away from home and was gone for many months.  One day she showed up and ran right up to me super happy.   She had a collar and was fatter and fluffier and to me that meant she was happier at her new home.  My mom had always refused to let her inside and thought animals weren't to be played with.  Basically from a time when animals were on the farm and for practical purposes only.  It broke my heart to say goodbye to her again, but I knew she was better off in her new home. She ran off after some cuddles and I never saw her again."

aww,"Doubt it, legs seem too long and ears too short for a corgi mix."
aww,"To anyone who sees this and thinks ""Hey I'd love one of these as a pet!"" DO YOUR RESEARCH. This is not a simple pet, nor should you just get one. Pairs minimum. They also take a big commitment. They are nocturnal. They require you to be on top of their diet, males that are not neutered can smell(this can also depend on the diet). Their claws hurt and they can nip you pretty good. But if you spend the time, bond with them, and interact with them, they can be awesome. Also, like most things, illegal in California due to the goofy blanket law on ""exotics"" we have."

I want to see cute vids/pics not memes. If only more people knew about/followed this rule."
aww,"Some nice, pure bread cats"
aww,"That's the problem. In conservation, the reason human contact isn't allowed is because it might make the animals more familiarized towards other humans. Since this tiger now might see humans as friendly companions or sources of food, it both raises the risk of it attacking human settlements and the risk of it getting captured and killed by poachers. For example, in Canada, if you are killed by a bear, they have to hunt and put down the bear because now it has a taste for humans. And since this is a problem due to the value of bears in nature, your family is then fined 10000 dollars. 

It's just an unnecessary problem in regards to conservation that could easily be avoided. The difference between your cat and this is that your cat is meant to be your pet for a long time. I'd presume in this case, they hope to release him again one day back into the wild."

aww,"Definitely four space bar presses, not tab. Also -

It's Reddit's old style markdown text formatting. 

Most people don't use it anymore since they updated the editor, and in fact trying to do so can screw things up now by not being recognised.
But on the mobile app you still need to remember the formatting rules, and also if you look somewhere around the edge of the reply box there should be a button to return you to using the old style editor. 

Then you'll have to use things like \* to italicize, \&gt; to quote people etc. Four spaces afaicr places any following lines into a sort of unicode box, mostly used if you're trying to share snippets of code so there's no more formatting recognised within it. It more commonly gets used for multi-line quoting though"

aww,You look like my husband lmao I was like that is NOT our cat üòÇ
aww,Give him a cuddle from me. He's a sweetie.
aww,Is he a chocolate lab crossed with a bear?!
aww,"Cute pets, are they both girls?"
aww,Still just as much as a cutie!
aww,"I think some species count, and some just kind of have to trust that all their babies are with them. Our dog would count up her 10 pups frequently, but I'm not sure ducks are intelligent enough to keep track of them all, especially due to the very high mortality rate early on."
aww,Maya is too good for this world!
aww,Oh my heart !!!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
aww,"Hmmmm reminds me when I was a kid lil brat and I said I wanted a birb, so I took a insanely long piece of rebar and said: ""I'll shake this bar until I get a birb"".

&amp;#x200B;

Suddenly a bird like the one you are holding fell down the sky, apparently I hit it with the piece of rebar.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so sad :'( I got the birb but it died shortly thereafter, thanks God, how you make something that unlikely happen :'( :'( :'( :'("
aww,"*In a very manly voice

_MOO NIGGA_"
aww,You can tell by his sweet face and his kind eyes that this is a very good boy. Many birthday hugs!

aww,Turtle food.    Count them every day.   They decrease.
aww,Are the minecraft lets plays
aww,It was cool and important for us as the spectator too. A lot of people think nature is all cute and innocent and about 90% of the time that's just not true. This is some good informational footage of how fucking fucked up some shit out there really is. I mean holy shit they didnt even kill the antelope they just went straight for the baby and the asshole.
aww,where can i find this kitty !!!!????????????????? I need to pet
aww,"Me, waiting for the lochness monster to swoop up"
aww,He‚Äôs a Maine coon! He isn‚Äôt full blooded I don‚Äôt think. The main feature of Maine coons is the long hairs on the bottom of their paws. Also their personalities are usually different from normal cats. They aren‚Äôt known to be very lovey and to be a ‚Äúlap cat‚Äù.
aww,It is for the better that they aren't as bulky. Even a lab not prone to hip problems will usually develop hip issues when they get this old and chunked.
aww,Very unique meow this fellow has! :D
aww,"With dogs I feel like if you get it from a shelter or a stray you say adopted and if you bought it more commonly you say say got a dog. So I don‚Äôt know why with cats it‚Äôs not the same, maybe bc more often than not people just become owners to cats rather than buying one."
aww,aww don‚Äôt cry - just give him lots of treats and cuddles!‚ò∫Ô∏è
aww,Cool! Thank you for that :)
aww,"Awe, I'm sorry, but hopefully you can call or talk to them soon. I bet they miss you just as much as you miss them:)"
aww,Give him a big hug for me
aww,Is your girlfriend single?
aww,The cat is a stand
aww,"How you can make nice selfcooked meals for your cats, you can read in this book."
aww,More like the repost squad. This picture is on this sub every week.

aww,It looks like a little kid waking up from a nap
aww,I wish your parents were bred so your ears would end up inside out too.

aww,Shame they turn into Giant Murder Potatoes.
aww,Use clay for your hair. It does miracles.

aww,So you traded up. Good for you!
aww,"The office is so old now that a cat named after a character ( whose name wasnt Phyllis VANCE until a few season is)  and that cat is a senior now..,... wow"

aww,How did she count them?
aww,Give him some headpats for me! :D
aww,Happy Birthday you big brown bear!
aww,"That's weird, my cat was breeded from a tabby siamese and tortoise shell, but he looks exactly like your cat and fits your description, he isnt much of a lap cat and has the hairs on his paws, and has a funny personality too!"
aww,Bro is slapped together like a well-aged Terry Crews
aww,"The way she ‚Äústeals‚Äù the bear in the reversed version doesn‚Äôt look anything like what you would do when stealing a stuffed bear. 

Edit: Same with the way she takes the blanket off. It doesn‚Äôt look right at all."
aww,I love him.  Thank you for sharing him with us.
aww,What a sweetheart. How old is he?
aww,"I mean, once dogs get to a certain age you kind of just cater to their needs. Our beagle gained near 15 pounds in the end of her life because we knew she had cancer and we couldn‚Äôt fix. So we just let her eat whenever she wanted, happiest I‚Äôve ever seen that dog."
aww,"""I really just came back to cool off for a few days and really don't have time for this shit, Dave.""

aww,"Can we please have a static pic or a still of the video- last frame just as he flicks his head up and sticks his nose out, I think it‚Äôs going to be a really cute pic"
aww,Look at that bear!
aww,"So sweet.  Meanwhile, house catches fire while cats &amp; photographer look on."

aww,"He chonky.

*hugs chonky bear*"
aww,"I appreciate your love of dogs, VeryMoistWalrus."
aww,"To be cool? Maybe that's projection on your part, but I'm not in high school mate. Plus I didn't call her Hitler. So many people are misunderstanding what I said."
aww,"Squeeeeee, this is adorable!"
aww,It's the buffalo chickens origin
aww,Omg I love senior dogs so much
aww,"PSA: This old boy deserves all the pets, but the older your dog is, the more their weight matters. Being overweight doesn't make arthritis any easier and I feel like most older dogs I see on here are significantly overweight."
aww,Twin a is the baby girl who‚Äôs a pound bigger and 4 minutes older!
aww,Yeah love him and care for him and pick up chicks because of him
aww,"I'd say get him a cat treadmill, but since this is a cat we're talking about, he'd probably completely ignore the very expensive made-for-him treadmill and still play in the washer instead"
aww,"He‚Äôs a very special boy
I can tell"
aww,"Oh lawd, he comin"
aww,You're a master of belly rubs
aww,Why did he sleep in a leash though?
aww,In some of those rescue stuck ducklings videos you can see the mother wait until all ducklings are back with her. So I'd guess they know how many babies they got.
aww,"Get ahold of a local wildlife center or rescue as soon as possible. Try to keep from handling it yourself, it needs to have vet attention as soon as possible."
aww,Goblins from Gringots bank
aww,Look at the size of that lad.
aww,The cake is a lie
aww,Look at that face üòç
aww,What a cutie! My chocolate lab turned 14 today :)
aww,That's what I was thinking. He's such a sweet looking dog.
aww,We tried! She only likes her pillow near the back patio door. The heating vent MUST be pristine and free of obstructions ü§£
aww,Take it to the nearest animal rescue or wild life service asap!! Please!
aww,"Once, I showed my daughter a Picture of a sloth and she said that it was ugly. Then I showed her a video of a baby sloth and now she is obsessed! Love the sloth!"
aww,"Okay, now this time I'm really going to get him!   Huh, what, oh yeah, my ear is scratchy again, see?"
aww,"He‚Äôs got a goofy face, just like my guy.  Give that big boy a hug for me!"
aww,Google this question instead of filming the Injured animal and waiting for people to reply. It‚Äôs really not rocket science
aww,Glad to see there were others who immediately assumed that was a bear
aww,Better than the one in that new movie
aww,I want to hug him
aww,"If you've got a Humane Society shelter nearby, that's your best bet."
aww,Looks like quite the unit.
aww,Get a wildlife center and take it there
aww,"And now I'm crying, thanks."
aww,Not at all. That's something I really love about him. He's an epic nuzzler.
aww,"Huhh then yea I ain‚Äôt too sure then. We actually found him inside of an old tractor so we aren‚Äôt 100% sure about his breed but he fit into most of the categories of a Maine coon.

Edit: also he‚Äôs really big. Weighing about 15lbs which is another trait to the Maine coon"
aww,I was gonna say either that or a licensed wildlife rehabilitator so that they can get the fox pup fixed up
aww,When you use beast instead of yeast.
aww,@powaqua is he a rescue? I think I have his brother!
aww,"Gone as in gone üò•, or you‚Äôve left for a bit?"
aww,Look at the paws on that boy!  He's done some travellin'
aww,I hope you're not actually planning on eating those. They're too cute to be eaten.
aww,"Presentation, 10. Cleanliness, 10. Personality, 10. HIRED!"
aww,I think this is Tony from the San Diego zoo.  It's on their Instagram
aww,pretty cute. I guess.
aww,I thought his eyes were right above his nose and he had two sets
aww,"Agree. Dog looks very overweight, which isn‚Äôt good for him."
aww,Sent this to the bf as a guessing game lol
aww,"I like how he licks the guy's arm like ""you know now that I think about it the arm sounds better!"""
aww,"He's 15, dude. Let him go out in a treat-riddled blaze of glory. That's old as hell for a big dog."
aww,Ok but whats in it?
aww,Ohmygod!! That is a cute ol boi!
aww,Old boys are the best &lt;3

aww,"Look up animal sanctuaries and rescues in your area, particularly ones dealing with foxes or small mammals, and contact them. Theyll give you the best course of action"
aww,"Ah wow cool! It's funny, not to get into too much detail but the father of my cat is also the brother of his mother so, yeeaaahh, cats do that, anyways give your cat many pets for me!"
aww,You will die in your sleep for this... ;)
aww,What a good doggy!!
aww,Make sure to give him all the lovins
aww,This is one of my favorite things.
aww,He is a unit.
aww,"After all those years and stitches, OP did think those paws were rather aggressive."
aww,I sure do wonder where she stowed that 18 eggs away...
aww,"I have a 14 year old dog, and the weight gained is mostly from not being able to run around as much (like at all really). Literally any food dropped by a toddler can add on 5 pounds."
aww,this shit looks like a demon
aww,Can you explain please? How do you stage two felines interacting? A cat is gunna cat.
aww,Mr. Potter must not go to Hogwarts!
aww,The detail exquisite - I need one of my 19 year old Betty next! ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,Haha I already know!

aww,"Clarification, I‚Äôm away on vacay for a month.  Sorry!"
aww,"Learned and cultivated behavior over thousands of years. Cats and dogs alike have spent so long with the job of ""companion"" (even when it's not their primary job, it's still their secondary) that it's become second nature to read human moods and tell when they're needed most."
aww,"Reminds me of my old lab, passed away 5 months ago at 14 &lt;3"
aww,"It's a repost, but they are cute as always."

aww,happy birthday sweet good boy!!
aww,The doggo of wisdoms.
aww,Can tell by that face he's a good boy.
aww,"She would basically just walk around sniffing each one.  It wasn't really obvious until we started giving away the pups. Once one was gone, she would go around frantically sniffing each one, and once she got to the 9th, she would just look up at us and whine really loudly and look panicked, before running back to go through them again. It was heartbreaking."
aww,This is the famous fable about the Tortoise and the Hairball.
aww,"My chocolate lab (7) is pretty bulky as well! Not quite as much as your sweet baby, but he‚Äôs got a chest like a barrel! Just means there‚Äôs more of them to love ‚ù§Ô∏è his fur is also thicker than his sister‚Äôs (4 year old black lab!)"

aww,An adorable killer :):)
aww,"No, that's too strong for the old bear. Cub hug."

aww,For me please could you kiss him right between the eyes. My old Labrador used to love that.
aww,"Thankfully, my cat is addicted too."
aww,"I don‚Äôt want to steal any attention from this good boy and op but I just lost my chocolate on 4/20/19, he was the best dog I‚Äôll ever have. Give your boy extra love for me in remembrance of Jack. 5/22/07 ‚Äì 4/20/19"
aww,what does this quote even mean
aww,How long do bears usually live??
aww,I will and I‚Äôll give him extra chin scratches too!
aww,Oh my god I remember seeing a duck with two. Now I'm sad.
aww,I just found a new page to follow.
aww,"Ugh, seeing these just makes me think about my little man who is getting on in years.  Hes not even fully there yet and already I'm dreading the loss.  Hug your pup extra tight for me please."
aww,"She's laying in the hole she dug herself. She was very satisfied with her hard work. Unfortunately for her, we didn't like the hole that much and closed it üòÇ"
aww,this cutie is older than me!
aww,"That's great,good for you."
aww,"I have 3 gsps, 1 weim, one husky, 2 cats (all under 3 years old) 4 kid (3months -10 years old)

Honestly, just working them outside long enough to tire then out. 

Granted, I have to be available 18 hours a day tending to someone's needs... but it beats the hell out of the daily production meetings I was going to before I moved out here and started  doing all this."
aww,Don‚Äôt make life harder than it needs to be.
aww,Who even uses Kelvin apart from scientists nowadays
aww,Grandboi does a good stand.
aww,"Yep! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiny_orb-weaver

They come in a variety of color combinations, too. I've white with black spikes and yellow with black spikes on my property."
aww,Watch his tongue get more and more active the closer he gets to putting his head under
aww,You should be so lucky
aww,Dogs get excited when they think you are going to take them for a walk. If someone trips over his leash the dog will hear it and wake up excited for a walk. Same probably goes for the poop bags
aww,Nawww so cute and so small. I bet it‚Äôs the fiercest dog when he/she wants to be tho. I had a west highlands terrier and a Great Dane at the same time many years ago. The little westie was the boss of those 2 lol
aww,"What a cute bear, eh dog? But he looks super sweet!"
aww,Such H  E  F  T
aww,I had 15 year old chocolate just like him. Best pups in the world! Cherish him ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,"I agree with this. He does look overweight, but I also think that at his age there isn't a whole lot you can do. His joints and bones are probably not doing very well, so it might be painful for him to walk enough to lose weight. Cutting back on his diet would be something to ask the vet about tbh."
aww,Yeah it sucks though. Turns out watching people who are just as bad as you is t all that fun
aww,"That is so cute that the qualifier ""fucking"" is needed. That is fucking cute!"
aww,"The prodigal son returns! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm glad he came back to ya'll! Must have been a whirlwind of happy emotions !! 

Wish I could give additional plus +1's for each of the guns + awestache but alas!"
aww,"As someone that regularly pulls up a chair to stand up meetings, I disagree :)"
aww,It wasn't a good idea.  I wasn't thinking at the time and I made a bad decision. I should have turned around and driven home when I found him.
aww,Mayhaps for good luck mayhaps because Op might be an idiot they only know lol
aww,Damn you play quarterback or something?
aww,Not today you useless troll.
aww,Me @ the club after ‚Äúone more‚Äù redbull vodka
aww,"Gently though, he's a hero."
aww,Post on animals being bros sub too
aww,Exactly.  And why wouldn‚Äôt they use a flamethrower?
aww,He looks good for huggin'.
aww,"Well, dogs have actually failed the mirror test. So even if directly looking at herself in the mirror, she would not recognize that it was her. 

So she was probably just weirded out by the owner applying the dye and then never even gave it a second thought and has no idea what the purpose or end result was."
aww,He looks so nice and soft.  I'm happy he's had you for an owner :)
aww,You can tell this pup‚Äôs had a good life!
aww,This is about as old as big dogs get.
aww,Oregon :) wish we were in Norway though
aww,Look at #10 being a lil asshole trying to take the point from him
aww,In my experience they are harmless.
aww,"That‚Äôs my GF. And yeah she‚Äôs good at throwing things. Sometimes at my head, which I don‚Äôt care for, but probably deserve...."
aww,"Hehe

I once was working on a Husky Kennel in Kanada and huskies love digging holes. But there was one husky that loved it too much. He dug under his little house until it was in the hole and his neighbour was covered in dirt üòÇ dogs are great :)"
aww,Never mind the belly look at that little hand!
aww,"Imagine how much money you would save, you wouldn‚Äôt get bored of this! 

... until you open the bottom and reuse the same coin over and over."
aww,Damn...that is a good dog.
aww,"haha nah I meant that if he heard the sound of his leash (the metal part) jingle then he auto-assumed that it was walk time and he wouldn't stop throwing a fit until we finally went or he got a snack to pacify him. Same with the sound of the bags being opened, he belonged to the people that I lived with and I was only there for the last few years of his life so I just went with the flow"
aww,#C H O M N K
aww,Please stop over feeding him. It‚Äôs bad for him
aww,Can someone make this go in reverse please? Cuz that would be freaky.
aww,"It's really just the state not having any fleet in place for clearing snow, so they just call it a state of emergency and say fuck it."
aww,"Thanks for the heads up. Her teeth and gums looks pretty good, plus her vet complimented her teeth at her last appointment last year. Something to keep an eye on though! 

She only ever drools like that when she climbs onto out chest to nuzzle and get pets. It seems to only happen when she's super happy with life."
aww,No that‚Äôs clearly a lab.
aww,Maybe feed him a little less and he'd be able to stand more easily
aww,Sign language: you are the best boy!
aww,I love how the Golden is licking mum and dad like ‚Äúomg CONGRATS!‚Äù
aww,"He is adorable! Also bitey, but that's to be expected at such a young age. We start puppy class next week!"
aww,That is a dog saint.
aww,"""Mr. Bond, so we meet again..."""
aww,I wish him 15 more.
aww,He‚Äôs also 15 and it‚Äôs his birthday...relax.
aww,pat him for us üòç
aww,My chonklate lab is an absolute unit as well. He‚Äôs very nice though.
aww,I just laughed at an innocent animal and I feel like trash.
aww,Yep that is fucking terrifying. Thanks.
aww,That‚Äôs a big dog
aww,"Oh my garshkk, THE EARS!"
aww,"Keep in mind that under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act it may be a felony to keep this bird. You can ask your local vet(s) if they know of a bird rescue/rehab center in your area that can give you further advice on the legal aspects, as well as advice for feeding and care."
aww,"You have to tell us what it was, so basically this is a video of someone dropping a briefcase on the ground. How is this ‚Äúaww‚Äù material, exactly?"
aww,That doesn‚Äôt matter at all. They are hurting him and shorting his life like this
aww,"Joint problems are extremely common on labs, I don't think his weight has anything to do with it."
aww,"That's just adorable, makes my heart melt"
aww,Looks pretty fucking ugly tbh
aww,i rate this doggo 12/10 - looks like the older version of my beloved friend who is named Buddy !
aww,"lmao sure I'll bite. Here's some of that attention you crave so much you miserable, small person."
aww,"Oi mate, that's called spawncamping"
aww,My condolences. I know it's horribly painful and I hope the gifts of his love and memories see you through it.
aww,"I mean, if he's struggling to stand, it's probably not really a blaze of glory."
aww,"OP, your friend looks like the goodest of boys. I would love to see you r/Pokemonify him."
aww,Look up eating pet coin bank on Amazon
aww,Agreed. I cut down my senior dog's food to match his activity. He lost a little weight and became a lot more mobile
aww,Looks like a unit of a sweetheart.  Congrats ol' boy.
aww,"Aww, I hope my cat dies this. I got out at the end of March. He had a collar and everything. I went driving around all night and searched for a week after. Never found him. A few weeks ago I saw a cat that looked like mine and a neighbor lady told me it was a female who was hanging around her porch. Not my Binx who is male. When I mentioned him to her she looked stunned and said a while  ago some guy was walking around asking if a black cat with a red collar belonged to her and she said no and that was the last she saw the man or cat. Soooo some man has my cat somewhere. I just hope Binx is happy and healthy. üò≠"
aww,"dunno how old you are these days, but you reach a point where getting party-drunk automatically means a hangover and a half. it kinda sucks. it's why I've generally switched to weed for my altered states."
aww,I read the caption as ‚Äúflowers‚Äù but was still not let down by the actual contents ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,"Yeah, not if they're struggling to stand though..."
aww,Yes this dog sits in her throne all day lmao
aww,"[Hug a bear, you say?](https://i.imgur.com/KPX4VtP.gifv)"
aww,It really doesn't pay to maintain a fleet of plows for the one time every three years we need them.
aww,"Where are my testicles, Summer?"
aww,"He's called Logan, thanks!"
aww,"We all want one, so give us the link please."
aww,Never lie down awake when you can lie down asleep. Never stay asleep when you can be dead.
aww,"Bit of a big boy, but that's more to cuddle. He looks so soft.

It's amazing how the things I say about dogs would be very creepy if they appeared in the context of talking about people."
aww,"Now, eat the kitty!!!"
aww,damn those ninjas cutting onions around \*angry fist move\*
aww,"Might be his most wise, actually."
aww,I like that it gets faster and faster and he starts smiling bigger and bigger
aww,Very kind eyes &lt;3
aww,Did you actually look at the reversed gif posted in this thread? It looks unnatural as shit. OPs is the real one.
aww,You can tell the brown doggo has worn a cone of shame before and knows what it feels like. The way the doggo is comforting friend doggo makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside .
aww,I hope everyone who gets their wild Schnoodle reads it to their pets. You the shit.
aww,"At least snakes are pretty, spiders are just creeps."
aww,such a cute chonker. wishing him a long and healthy life
aww,"They pretty much all are harmless. There are very few spiders in the US that are venomous, and not that many more that even have the facial geometry that would allow them to bite a person."
aww,Cat just wants to give birdy a little kiss... heh
aww,"Omg he looks so proud and pleased with himself. 
Adorable"
aww,It's well known that doggos can read lips.
aww,"I actually like to stand up with effort, too."
aww,What a lovely thing to do! These three are precious. You have turned their lives around.
aww,"Good boy!! He has very nice eyes, looks like a sweet pup"
aww,That doesn‚Äôt look normal at all! OPs is the real one.
aww,Awww! They could be sisters! :) Adorable!
aww,You can't go to bed dead and wake up alive!
aww,"My dog is a Stabyhoun which are often used to hunt moles, so she naturally digs up molehills and leaves the forest plowed. It's very cute to watch her sniff with her nose full in the dirt. Luckly, she isn't smart enough to catch any."
aww,"Honestly, this is it, folks. This is the day my heart has ruptured.

Look at those *eyes* oh my god that is pure love right there!"
aww,It would not be out of character!
aww,I just gotta hug him!
aww,Thank you kind stranger üòª
aww,Sending that boy my love ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,Never stay dead when you can be a ghost.
aww,"Quickly get him some necture, sugar water, or honey. hummingbird can't go long without food, they can only go 10 mins without food"
aww,What beautiful cats! Are they brothers?
aww,"Bitch, I'm a cow."
aww,Octopuses is correct! Just so you know. :)
aww,"Thank you, and I think they actually are! They have the same dad :)"
aww,My cats do that right before they fight for who will sleep on 'the chair' at night....
aww,"He has such a kind face, and I totally get the feeling that if he talked he would sound like Baloo from the Jungle Book.

aww,Chonky boy is good boy
aww,"Reptiles tend to stress easily and even though the cat is house trained i, it would be very easy for it to decide to strike that bearded dragon and hurt/kill it. Sure it makes a cute video for social media but in reality you aren't doing any favors to your reptiles."
aww,"Oh, can I get your phone number?"
aww,Big boi is an absolute unit!
aww,His puppy dog eyes!!!! What a good boy!
aww,Corgis just have to grow into their ears
aww,Happy Dog day. I had to put my old girl down Monday and still looking for her from habit. May the sad day you must say goodbye be many days in the future. I loved my old one like a sister and respect that look in his eyes. Old love and humor like that is a beautiful thing indeed. Give him a hug for me. I must say he looks sturdy!
aww,The spice must flow
aww,"He's an English type lab not American.  Learned there are two ""types"" when my parents got a lab.  The English has a thicker coat, more square head and overall bulkier.  This link goes into more details.

aww,"Psst, you can save posts and comments."
aww,I hope my dog will live to 15!
aww,"Don't be sad. She probably died and didn't leave any extra cat food so the cat chewed on her for a while before neighbours caught the smell and let him out.

Edit: [source](https://youtu.be/6-kM_ZDaodU)"
aww,He looks beary happy

aww,Ah i see you offer the high class cuisine known as Maintenance Cat. Well played.
aww,"Well the chocolate cake and the 2 beers for starters. Also the darting heads of the 2 cats, following a toy of some sort. I would say 2 toys, the white cat following one and the black cat following the other, forcing them to face each other when the 2 toys pass by each other. Now their reactions are genuine, but the entire act, at least to me, felt forced beyond the ""aww"" threshold. 2 cents."
aww,Sweet precious baby! Makes me want to go home and love on my senior.

aww,Is this a birb?
aww,Yeah my two kids go nuts to that song too
aww,You needed to move closer to play with him lol
aww,"Urban UK, suburban US."
aww,"Haha yeah, but rest assured, it's no distress. I've known that cat for several years (I was told he's 13-14 years old), the incessant meowing is simply an acknowledgement ritual whenever we cross paths on the street (and I noticed he doesn't do it to everyone). It is usually followed by head bumping, stretching / rolling around and asking to be petted. He usually guides me towards the end of the street or my home, depending on which direction I'm headed.  


Great cat, truly my buddy!"
aww,"Happy birthday, from one [birthday boy] (https://imgur.com/gallery/eP5X4jy) to another! It's tough to see them getting older, but a joy to have them in our lives as long as they're around! Nothing could ever beat man's best friend as a companion!!

Edit: wanted to swap pictures of our faithful companions! üòÅ"
aww,"Yeah, because letting a dog suffer with the pains associated with being overweight is a great idea.

Fuck this mentality."
aww,"Lol, meant in the best of humor :) It actually comes in a lot of colors, but you may have to find it in a baking/restaurant specialty supply."
aww,Like a cute grizzly
aww,Get that boy a t-bone.
aww,Voltamatron Destroyer of Worlds
aww,Happy (remainder of your) cake day!
aww,You are 100% Lee Pace
aww,"I have a black cat who does the exact same thing, pushes the blinds aside and sits on the window sill like that üòä"
aww,"well yeah, that's why special food for senior pets exists. It has fewer calories and more fiber to keep them full without making them fat in their old age. When your dog can't be as active, you need to cut back their calories one way or another, otherwise you just aggavate their problems by adding weight and get this."
aww,I‚Äôm sorry you have gone through this. Heartbreak from losing a dog is like nothing else I‚Äôve ever experienced. Those ears are beautiful also.
aww,I mean you are what you eat...

aww,"Finally a Labrador that looks like mine! I have a black lab and he‚Äôs always been a lot larger than the others, especially his head"
aww,"So I kind of want to give some extra background on this. It's not needed to enjoy the cuteness (speaking solely as her proud cat parent), but it might be a little nice for context.

Our senior cat has been having a lot of the problems most senior Manx cats do with her hips over the last few years. It got to the point where she would cry out whenever we would pet her hind area and she was using the bathroom beside the litter box because getting in and out hurt too much. Our vet suggested we try CBD oil before anything heavy duty.

 She has now been on CBD oil 800mg twice a day for three months now and is like when we brought her home from the shelter. Not only is she using the litter box again but she's also playing and seeking out butt scratches. And of course, sitting around like the little weirdo we know and love."
aww,Danger noodle says hello :)
aww,Is the beer for the kitties too?
aww,His snoot and paws show oodles of wisdom and many miles of fetches and plays. 13/10 good pup.

aww,Mine bloomed yesterday too! Same flower!
aww,He is a good boi
aww,What a chipper lad!!
aww,"Yep, my old pup who is passed now was 17, she got about 15 lbs overweight because she couldn't do walks anymore. She had bad arthritis and was always way happier chubbin out. Especially since she had torn both ACLs at one point in her life"

aww,Awwww......he looks kinda like a small bear
aww,"Looks so happy and that's the main thing. That, and you get your apostrophes right. That's really the main thing. And the cuteness, that's sincerely the main thing."
aww,He'd be far far happier and comfier if he didn't have to carry all that extra weight around. Letting him lose weight would be doing him a huge favour in his last years.
aww,Oh lawd he comin‚Äô
aww,"I have a big long haired tuxedo that rolls on his back because he wants me to do this, but then when I do, he digs his needle-like claws into my hand. I keep a bottle of alcohol handy to fight infection. He loves me, but is very sensitive as to where I'm allowed to touch."

aww,"He'd live longer and be happier with less weight. There's absolutely no reason to say ""fuck it"" except being lazy."
aww,Yes! Beagle Bowling! :)
aww,Is he overweight or just really that big??
aww,Aww they are so cute
aww,I'm betting you're just frustrated. How could anyone truly be mad at him?

aww,That face! Such a sweet pup üòçü•∞
aww,What an adorable little face!
aww,"Well, Blue with orange irises, but yes. Blue eyes. That love you. üòò"
aww,Usually weight problems are what cause or at the very least exacerbate hip problems. Carrying that extra weight also makes any existing problems that much more painful.
aww,Yup yup. He's having trouble getting up in large part from likely being overweight for so long. And him being overweight currently is certainly not helping any.
aww,I see what you did there.
aww,"He has such a presence. Wise and good-natured, like a doggo-shaped forest spirit, or something."

aww,What an absolute unit.
aww,this is so fucking homo
aww,Ur breath is a bit...fishy.
aww,He'd probably live longer AND have an easier time standing if he weighed less. So many obese dog apologists in this thread.
aww,He‚Äôs such a good boy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è You give him an ear scratch from me!
aww,"He‚Äôs very cute and obviously loves you, but I‚Äôm not seeing blue eyes."
aww,corgos are da best
aww,"‚ÄúI wanna walk like you, talk like you...‚Äù"
aww,Yea but he shouldn't be overweight in the first place and has likely been overweight for some time. There's no reason to keep your dog (or yourself for that matter) overweight no matter how old they are. It never helps.
aww,"I present to you, the boar-hound."
aww,Snot is a great name. upvote.
aww,"Happy Birthday, puppy! &lt;3"

aww,My 15 yo GSP still gets me up about 5 has for the last 14 years

aww,Haha.. wow that escalated quickly.
aww,It hurt my feelings
aww,"They‚Äôre definitely blue. üòÇ

edit: they look a little more grey in the picture but I can say with confidence that he‚Äôs got blue eyes with orange irises. Either way, he‚Äôs a handsome little goober."

aww,He looks like he gives good cuddles.
aww,A very good boy
aww,A family friend had that happy to a puppy.   Terrible.
aww,Please help him lose some weight. It will help him win standing and lengthen his life. 15 is already long. Get him to 20
aww,And he just made 42.000 people smile
aww,I think I pulled his food bowl too early last night and he woke up because he was hungry. What I‚Äôve learned over the years about puppies is if they do something bad and you want to blame the responsible party you can usually find them in the bathroom mirror.
aww,"Ofc it hurts but just remember they love you without a doubt, they can just be silly sometimes"
aww,I tried that and it didn't work.
aww,please tell me titan is the white one
aww,Doesn't matter if he's not walking as much. You adjust their diet accordingly. You can't gain weight from nothing. It's all calories in the end.
aww,I am 90% sure they're siblings.
aww,Aww. I wonder what a corgi pitbull would look like...
aww,"not OP but i bake a lot, do it beforehand, otherwise the food coloring wont fully dry down. They‚Äôll just come out looking a little deformed, but sticky food coloring is not fun when trying to eat."

aww,"Sebaceous adenoma. Old dogs get them, they are hairless benign skin tumors. She must have scraped it on something as she walks around with her head down. I've taken so many off of her already."
aww,How vein is your puppy that it's using the mirror often?
aww,"He's past the point of no return. He's 15 ffs.

If you want to shame OP for letting their dog get that chonky then by all means knock yourself out.

Putting a 15 year old dog on a diet will accomplish absolutely nothing."
aww,I think your doggo is also a gossip boi.
aww,He‚Äôs so pretty!! What breed?
aww,Better than a bear nailing you. üò≤
aww,We‚Äôve been really lucky. Other than the first week he‚Äôs been sleeping till 615-630 and sometimes later on the weekend. I think last night was a fluke.

aww,He a big boiiiiiiiiiiiiii
aww,"Haven't seen anyone mention this, so here we go:

He'd have an easier time standing if he wasn't so overweight. I know I'm going to get hate messages for saying that but it must be said. So many people seem to be in denial or just ignore the fact that their dog is overweight."
aww,Looks like a wise old soul. How precious he is
aww,B E A R B O Y E
aww,"I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!"
aww,"Hug him for me.  I used to tell my dog before he passed away in January, ""it doesn't matter if you turned 60, you'll always be my baby puppy."""
aww,"I'm calling bullshit! You baked those, and i'm proud of you!"
aww,"She still chews on stuff when she finds it, she squeaks her toys, basically the same stuff the other dogs do except it takes her longer to get where they are going unless I carry her.

One thing she used to do was find one of our cats and just sit and watch it and wag her tail. Now she can't do that anymore, and none of the cats will come up to her randomly. I do have a red eared slider turtle outside in a fenced pen and one day she was laying right beside the turtle wagging her tail. She must have found it by smell. The turtle probably sat with her because she didn't bark at it like the other dogs do."
aww,I am gonna have to trust you on the 18 cuz I don't feel like taking my shoes off right now to count.  Very cute.
aww,I want to cuddle him!
aww,"I think you may have a fundamental misunderstanding of how dogs work. 
Regardless, from what i've seen OP saying in the comments, he's super fluffy, and actually isn't overweight, and it's his birthday. Chill out a bit dude."
aww,Dude get a flee comb asap. I fostered a street kitten for a while while permanent adoption was being set up and the lil fuzzball was covered in them. Still adorable as heck though

Brought one home to foster for a weekend and when I brought the pup to an adoption fair he told me to bring her back as he already found her a forever home. I stopped fostering after that.

Particularly when they're only a few metres above you, hovering in the middle of the trees.

aww,"I agree with the others in this thread calling for more careful concern for this sweet boy's diet. Difficulty in standing, regardless of age, can potentially be alleviated by a change in diet. I may be downvoted for this, but I am curious why it seems like OP is reluctant to reply to comments related to Zeus' weight and a change in diet. I think we all just want the best for him, OP."
aww,This definitely isn't an American bobtail unless its mixed... the defining feature of a bobtail is its bobbed tail its born with.
aww,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs inevitable. If their activity decreases, can we not adjust their diet to match? My one dog‚Äôs 11 and weighs a bit less than when he was a young adult (less muscle mass). He eats less than he did when he was young, but a lot of dogs are not very good at self-regulating their intake. My other dog I adopted when he was 11 and brought him down from 52 to 45 lbs. His mobility and energy level are fantastic now!"

aww,That two buns aren‚Äôt supposed to touch.
aww,"Why thank ya! Most of the credit goes to my amazing mom. That woman is a saint and truly inspirational dog owner.

She's a very special pup. Her mother was a stray that died in childbirth in a field, but Shadow and her sister amazingly survived for the next 5 months before being rescued by a shelter and then adopted by us. She's always had a bit of a hardened edge as a result, but she's fiercely loyal and has been spoiled rotten since day one from a large yard in Texas to plenty of countryside in Arkansas."
aww,Looks like a lap puppers to me. Happy born day. ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,"My Rottie is 18, can‚Äôt do long walks. Her diet was adjusted accordingly, and she is a healthy, normal weight.

If your dog is less active, stop overfeeding them. As a dog ages and becomes less active, they need less calories. Simple as that."

aww,"Please help your dog lose weight. 

My boy is 15 and just last year was struggling to get up or walk on the stairs. Cutting his food down and helping him lose weight (even though he wasnt even overweight in the first case) made a huge difference, and now hes much more mobile!"

aww,"Actually funnily enough, there are many species, especially birds which don't really keep track of if the babies are even theirs or not. There are tons of examples of birds laying eggs in different bird's nests of not only the same species, but some examples of birds such as the cowbird which only lays eggs in other bird's nests. This way other bird's have the burden of taking care of their children.

The cowbird for example is typically much larger than the other birds when it is first hatched, making it easier for it to get food from the new parents as it has a longer neck and can reach further. It is also usually much shorter of a hatching period, that way it's out first and is able to be fed before any of the other birds in the nest."
aww,"My first thought was it was a character from the TV show Vikings. I seen a few episodes of that show. I am actually pretty stoked I have not seen Game of Thrones yet. I remember the first time I watched The Wire, and I would love to just erase my memory and watch it again for the first time."

aww,"My old cat had a small tail (about half the length of a normal cat) that came to a little 90¬∞ angle at the end. She had beautiful markings, bright green eyes and despite being full grown was a little bigger than a kitten. I tried to keep her as indoor only but she was born as an ally cat and wanted to be outside. Went missing for a week and while riding around my neighborhood calling her name (she wore a collar with our address and phone number) this guy says ""Oh she's over here. She really loves my garden and loves tuna"". He had been feeding her tuna everyday and keeping her at his place. Eventually she stopped coming home and when I asked him to stop feeding her the tuna because I couldn't keep up with that he said ""But she really loves it. I think she would be happier over here"". I had gotten a new kitten to keep her company and honestly she was kinda a bitchy cat, so I told the guy he could just keep her. But yea, it was kinda messed up that he wouldn't stop trying to keep my cat."

Well, grandma had filled it with candy so she gave him a broom stick. ""Hit it! Hit it!"" He just looked at her, puzzled.

So grandma grabbed the stick and started beating the shit outta Bloos Coos, and of course he burst into tears and started crying.

aww,Is his name Beamer? Because he looks just like a dog who comes into the daycare I work at
aww,"This good boi receives a hug for every like on this post, which means 91.4k hugs have been given to your doggo."
aww,"Putting a 15 year old dog on a diet will make them more comfortable and reduce their pain regardless of what ""point"" they're past. Why should the dog suffer more than he needs to when he could be more comfortable and have more mobility? Because no matter how old he is losing weight *will* put less stress on his joints and *will* reduce any arthritis pain and prevent further wear and tear that would cause even more pain. So of course I think it's better and kinder for the dog to reduce the amount of pain he has to suffer from a poor diet.

Let him go out in a healthy active blaze of glory instead of a slow agonizing drag that keeps him from doing what he loves as long as possible."
aww,"That‚Äôs not a puppy. So don‚Äôt call it a pup. Your dog is 15, it‚Äôs gonna be dead in like two weeks. Just stop"

I‚Äôm a total home body and my home is my safe place, so I‚Äôm seeing this as a growing opportunity.  (At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling myself.)"
aww,Haha yeah! A very small one! He is very prone at the moment  of being top-heavy given the weight of his head currently.
aww,He didn‚Äôt even kiss me when I got home. He only had eyes for Calhoun.

He couldn't keep up, but he would follow along, wagging his tail the whole time. When we turned around and came back, we would catch up with him and he would walk the rest of the way back with us.

aww,"About 15 years ago, I kept hearing this weird screeching growl noise at night. Had no idea what it was. My computer was next to a window with no screen, with some shrubs next to it. One night the screech-growl sounded very close...I looked out the window and there was a creature right in my face in the window. I think I yelled and it ran off. At the time I thought it was a deformed possum, it was way too big and lanky. I joked about it being a possum coyote hybrid. But after seeing this picture, it may well have been an albino raccoon."
aww,Lots of animals engage in rape. But that‚Äôs just mating for them.

I give him glucosamine but cbd appears to make the symptoms worse - He loses function of his back legs even more on cbd. I have been giving him different kinds of mushrooms (lions mane, cordyceps, chaga, turkey tail) and have seen a lot of improvement in his movement and other areas of his health. Thanks for your concern. I wanted to have him on cbd but it is pretty noticeable that he loses function bc can‚Äôt really walk. When I gave it to him at night I noticed he would pee more often."

aww,Course theres the internet.  I heard rumors they sell a few things on there
aww,No chip. Put up posters.  The vet said it looks taken care of but people leave behind animals all the time so give it a week then come back for all the tests and such. She said she is a Siamese and very pretty and people will try to steal her
aww,"Oh, we renamed them when we took them in! Her name was originally Rainstar. There was no way I was going to have a cat named Rainstar. üòÇ"

aww,"The problem I have with this is that 18 eggs would weigh half her body weight. I think a better explanation is that she is the foster mother of another ducks hatchlings.

aww,Pun patrol is going to find you! Hind! Run for your life!
aww,"Owned a good number of cats, the only time they have ever painted like that was when there was a dramatic change (taking then to the vet) or when they were overheated. I‚Äôve never seen one so it after an intensive running around session...they aren‚Äôt like dogs in that they typically don‚Äôt over exert themselves like dogs do."
aww,Tell him happy birthday for me!! :D
aww,What‚Äôs the time difference between the photos?
aww,what is uh... the context here.
aww,How rude. You need to be giving that pupper lots of pets instead of taking pictures

aww,He won't here you!
aww,Tell bandito I love him
aww,damn what a cute boy! he's looking good for  15 year old large dog. you must be taking care of him pretty good
aww,"You don‚Äôt need to ask the vet about it. He‚Äôs clearly overweight. I‚Äôve worked in the pet industry for ten years and there is no excuse for an overweight dog. People on here are saying oh he‚Äôs old anyway. That‚Äôs exactly when you should be caring for them the most. His joints probably do hurt, and they‚Äôd hurt a lot less without the extra weight."
aww,oh she gets showered w compliments all day
aww,"lol he did, shut up discount condom."
aww,"He isnt suffering anymore, that was literally the point of the surgery. And should I have removed the cone and risked injury just so he looked more appealing to you? The caption was absolutely not meant for karma points. Maybe the reason you find so many posts to be negative is because you have a negative mindset."
aww,"a friend of mine styles her pixie like op but a little more swept back .  it's stupidly easy with the hair paste that she uses. she combs it through lightly dampened hair with her head upside down for the volume then stands back upright like a normal person and shapes it into place as it dries, turns matte and sets.

aww,Much floof. Would pet and give all the loves!
aww,"A lot of the chocolates bred for hinting look like they have a bit of Chesapeake, especially when older or wet depending on their coat. I am walking my old labby now, he would be very excited if he saw another old dog, it is probably his third favorite thing."
aww,That's a bear :3 üêª
aww,"I used to think the same way but after seeing what happens to farm animals - even the 'free range' ones, and actually seeing how they are killed at abattoirs, I realised it's worse than I thought. But if you don't care about animal living conditions, there's still the huge environmental impact of animal agriculture to consider (cheese is in the top 5 worst foods for the environment) and the health benefits of eating less meat and dairy (even if you believe cutting it all out isn't healthy, there's plenty of evidence linking meat and dairy to cancer and cardiovascular disease and obesity). Dairy has recently been associated with increases in prostate and testicular cancer which might be due to the higher levels of estrogens and progesterone in dairy milk that are a result of milking pregnant cows. This used to happen a lot less frequently than it does now. Non pregnant dairy milk doesn't have the same problem. But since cows need to have recently had a baby to produce milk, most dairy cows are currently pregnant. 

I'm pointing this stuff out because you might not already know. That's all."
aww,In this situation don't you give him a low five? Jumping up - sure; high five. You clearly need to under arm this one.

aww,I don't know who this is?
aww,"Yeah, I'm sure all of that excess fat weighing on your arthritic joints has nothing to do with an influx of pain."
aww,Woah. Definitely scrolled back up. You right
aww,"A nice sentiment but dogs are equally happy being pet as they are getting treats. He won't know the difference if his owners decide to cut back on treats, he'll just feel better. Arthritis is a bitch, it's even worse if the dog has extra pounds to weigh him down."
aww,Ok I'll take all 5
aww,aw man this one made me feel bad after just watching Hateful Eight.
aww,Have you ever swallowed a bubble?! It actually kind of hurts!!! Lol
aww,"You‚Äôre gonna get downvoted to hell and back, but it needs to be said. My sister let her dog live long into being blind and deaf and sleeping all the time. What kind of life is that? Just suffering. It makes no sense, people are so selfish"
aww,"sorry, you are mistaken. This is a DOG subreddit, not a bear subreddit. (he still looks like a fine gentleman)"
aww,Do tiger tounges also feel like sandpaper?
aww,Every single health problem in the world is much worse when something is overweight

aww,I want more of these please
aww,Clearly never been ^
aww,That's worth two in the bush
aww,He's massively overweight. The owner is a dumbass
aww,"I think it's something most owners might not think about, because you're feeding the dog the same amount throughout most of his/her lifetime, but it is a good idea to cut down when they get older and less active! Glad it worked for you."
aww,Actually pretty much fact that labs are more prone to hip dysplasia. No harm in treating a lab who‚Äôs older with more food.
aww,What‚Äôs the mixture of the one on the left?
aww,"Yeah, I always thought that you had to buy flutes off shady people from the street. The fact that there are building to buy things in blows my mind."

aww,Elliot is the bestest boy
aww,"Adorable, and he has no neck. üòÇ"
aww,that would take... serious effort.
aww,"Exactly.

It's cruel. If dogs can't run and play, or go on walks (let alone stand), or do all of that stuff dogs love to do, then they're left to suffer in pain and agony. Don't allow a selfish inability to deal with feelings of loss hurt your pet. Respect your furry family members and put them down when there's no quality of life left."

Eyebrows on fleek Mr Neatbeard!"

aww,"Two hippos, one cup."
aww,Does he know yet?  Hubby...not puppy.
aww,"&gt; So many obese dog apologists in this thread.

I was surprised by this, I felt like most people were pretty respectful in pointing out that he'd have an easier time if he lost some weight. Not gonna lie, when my dog started gaining weight as she got older, it took a while before it occurred to me that I should be feeding her less instead of just trying to force her to exercise more than she was comfortable with. I don't blame OP for not having cut back on food but it's always good to educate people."
aww,"Oh please, say to me
You'll let me be your man"

aww,Does he have a favorite pillow or chair?
aww,I love his beautiful face!
aww,He's a proud papa!
aww,"This face shape in cats like this one is one of the few things that makes me think ""What an ugly cat"" right off the bat.

 I don't know why. 

Cats can be missing eyes, scarred to hell and I'll think them cute right off the bat but a triangular face like this sets off my Judgment rather than Aw first. I'd still coo and pet the shit out of this cat though. 

All cats are still cute and such and thus deserve love."
aww,I wonder why I got a bunch of downvotes and you got upvoted. Maybe yours is more clearly sarcasm

aww,"I suppose that's where the phrase ""two shakes of a lambs tail"" come from. Quickest wags this side of the whatever..."
aww,He is fabulous!  Treasure every minute.
aww,"I don‚Äôt think panting is always bad. I think you probably know your cat well enough to judge if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs tired or because he‚Äôs nervous. My cat did this a couple of times when she was a kitten. She only did this after playing with her favorite toy (still her favorite to this day). I think it‚Äôs because she didn‚Äôt know when to stop with her favorite toy. It was much too fun! (In case you‚Äôre wondering, her favorite toy is a dragonfly fishing pole toy with crinkly wings)  On the other hand, my bf‚Äôs old cat would pant when visiting the vet due to stress. It‚Äôs not a typical behavior, but I wouldn‚Äôt say a cat is in distress if they‚Äôre panting. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not too concerning after a good play session! Just make sure she has lots of water :)"
aww,Cute big üêª bear Pupper!!
aww,"Holey crap, that dog would hear anything coming."

It's honestly just a lose-lose situation. Yours is not the only comment I've focused on. I've upvoted all comments as the support has been so overwhelming I dont have time to personally reply to all of them. You're opinion of me doesnt matter.

aww,"So there‚Äôs a few reasons actually! You‚Äôd think it‚Äôs similar but experts say that ‚ÄúA honey water solution served up in hummingbird feeders can quickly become toxic and deadly. Honey rapidly ferments and also cultures a deadly bacterium. Contrary to popular belief, honey is not ""more natural"" than the cane sugar that is sold as white sugar. Honey has been chemically altered by honey bees: it is flower nectar and whatever ever else the honey bee ingested, digested, and spit back out again. Honey is nothing like the sucrose found in flower nectar and white sugar.‚Äù [gardenweb](https://www.gardenweb.com/discussions/2766159/can-i-use-honey-instead-of-sugar-in-a-hummingbird-feeder)  
So, honey doesn‚Äôt have the same chemical structure as floral nectar, the sticky substance can get stuck on their beak and feathers or crystallize leaving them victim to prey. There‚Äôs more reasons as to why it‚Äôs worse in a feeder but it sounded like you just meant in a jam try honey, maybe? But yeah, that‚Äôs what the experts say and I‚Äôm not an expert, to be honest, I just recently really got into hummingbirds and was going to take in an injured one yesterday so I researched it a bunch."
aww,"Looks a little like my fat boy.

aww,"Super sweet girl. Only a pup at 10 months. Just now getting an attention span, which makes walking a bit more enjoyable for her.... Still displaying a a real talent for random 90 degree darts out into the street."
aww,So wonderful. What was his reaction when he opened his eyes after surgery?
aww,Kindly fuck off. Ya dumbass.
aww,"So many people have told me that their arthritic dog got a new pep in the step from glucosamine-chondroitin. [Here‚Äôs a bit of info](https://www.vetinfo.com/is-it-safe-to-use-human-glucosamine-for-dogs.html), your vet can advise you about dosage etc. 

PS I hear it helps arthritic cats, too."
aww,Fenrir is such a cool name
aww,"I'm Korean and it disgusts me that the practice still exists in the pretense of ""tradition"".

Unregulated and inhumane, often times the dogs with registered collars that get lost are abducted for use in food. It's also illegal in Korea.

aww,It looks like a corgi but with hands
aww,"Yeah I can understand if it's unintended weight due to lowered activity levels and not thinking to adjust the diet accordingly, but so many people here are basically saying ""ah let him be fat he'll die soon anyway might as well eat what he wants"". But dogs don't eat what they want, they eat what they're given, and if you give them weight appropriate food they'll be happier and in less pain in their old age."
aww,Oh is that all it causes? Lol
aww,"I legit don‚Äôt get it.

Guy says something unpopular, then accuses the op of being insincere about how happy they are.

The fuck man? Guy needs to chill out, and take some joy in the fact that someone was able to help their pet recover from cataracts."
aww,"My boyfriend‚Äôs cat does this. The cries and whines until you pay attention to her, then if you stop she starts up again."

aww,Yo that's not your cat. I think that's the cat that ate your cat and absorbed his knowledge and has come to live with you to gain your trust until it can one day get strong enough to eat you too.
aww,You are much happier holding smaller dogs.
aww,I‚Äôll be visiting in 9 days and more excited to see her than any of my friends... she might convince me to stay!

aww,i wish i could upvote this more than once
aww,Someone called the cops!
aww,"Poor pupper. He reminds me of my hound dog when he was old. I had to lift him into the car and lift him down when we went on the trails. When he REALLY got old I didn't need the tracking beacon anymore, because he didn't wonder off once he was over the age of 12."

Eventually the fish monger caught and killed the cat though... It was nice while it lasted I suppose."

aww,Didn‚Äôt notice the cat at first... the handsome man holding him is hard to not stare at...
aww,"him and my hair are a similar degree of fluffy, my apologies"
aww,"Eh at that point that might be natural selection as cruel as it sounds, if ducklings that are too slow or dumb to follow die the next generations will end up being faster and smarter"
aww,"I am embarrassed to admit that I would let my parent's golden retriever mix lick my feet at the end of the day. I think she liked the salt, but it would put me in a tranquil state. Other times I would brush her fur and cut out those knots that would form on the backs of her legs, and she would be in a restful state. Later in life I would comb my daughter's hair after a bath, and she would comb mine. Must be something to it."
aww,That‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs pretty clear he loves that attention.

After they didn't get better after glucosamine and pain meds finally went to a doggie surgeon who said it's a completely torn CCL (think ACL in humans). Fully snapped. We felt awful!

The rehab from the surgery was hell for us and her, but all the money and ass pain in the world was worth seeing her chase squirrels again. 

I'm glad your baby sees again so she can again put a face to those who love her."

aww,WHAT A HANDSOME BOY
aww,You gave your good boy a new lease on life and you know a dog would know how to not waste that.
aww,"I know this is late, but raccoons also have opposable thumbs. The point was, without the opposable thumb, walking upright which frees up the hands, would have been of little benefit. Also, said primates also use tools and have a better grasp, pun intended, over their environment because of their opposable thumbs, not because they can also walk on two feet. I am not trying to be combative as ultimately both orthopedic characteristics have been tremendously advantageous for human domination over our environment and advancement of our technologies. 

Also a little late, username check out üòâ"

aww,‚ÄúStay calm bro I gotchu‚Äù
aww,I personally am so glad you did this for your baby! My 1.5 year old puppy has severe hip dysplasia diagnosed around 10 months old. We were told we would have to do two total hip replacements. When I told people we were going to save up and do the surgery for him they told me they would just put him down. He wasn‚Äôt even a year old yet. Is that really people‚Äôs first reaction to an animal with reparable health issues?! If you can do something to improve your animal‚Äôs quality of life I think you absolutely should. Good for you for taking care of your sweet doggo!!
aww,Wasn't this the plot of *Six Dinner Sid*?

aww,"Our doggy had a cataract as well that turned her entire pupil white. She also started getting corneal abrasions pretty frequently and then developed glaucoma in the same eye, so she eventually had to get t removed.

aww,This  video is highly improved by audio
aww,That‚Äôs a fucking bear
aww,"What fucking smile? I swear everyone takes an animals normal behavior and paints it whatever they want it to be. Fucker is hot so he's panting to cool himself down. Not fucking ""smiling"""
aww,"I went through his post history. He's a sociopath and doesn't realize it. He lacks human empathy and feels he's a genius compared to the rest of Reddit. He posts comments about 20 times a day. By page 7, I was still on day 4 of his ramblings against MCU movies and how they're for kids and he even spoiled Endgame around page 8 or 9. (Luckily a mod removed his post from the actual comments)

He's just broken in the head. He'll die alone with his snakes breaking out of their enclosures to survive on his slowly, bloating corpse."
aww,"It is though you feed them less, senior diets ect. We control 100% of what goes into our dogs mouths and we can readjust their diets as necessary"
aww,"No, it‚Äôs actually pretty simple. Realize that since it‚Äôs old and it‚Äôs life might be only a couple months you‚Äôd like to make it a good last months. Let it eat whenever it wants. y‚Äôall act like these animals are going to live forever."
aww,"Do you live in an area with lots of hunters? I'm so used to spending time around those slim and muscly working labs that it's really jarring when I see a show dog. It's always like ""Whoah, one of those dogs like on TV!"""
aww,"We adopted him from Lucky Spot Rescue in San Antonio, Texas."

aww,My chocolate lab died at 15 this year

aww,Your lil guy now
aww,"Awesome! Thanks for hearing me out. And you totally should go pick one up! The birds came within a day when I‚Äôd never even seen them in my yard before! It‚Äôs honestly the highlight of my day. They‚Äôre so cute and we‚Äôre working on hand feeding. Ps, if you make your own nectar use 4 parts water and 1 part sugar and no need for dye.  üôÇ"

aww,Seems to be mocking the cat.
aww,"It's common and frustrating. My friend in elementary had three cats in two years because his family let them wander the neighborhood, they were always upset and surprised they were hit by cars. Meanwhile my family kept ours indoors until they passed at 16 and 15. You wouldn't let your dog run around unattended so I don't get what makes cats any different.

Protip, if you want you cat to live, don't let it outside."
aww,"Looks like he‚Äôs already tired of your shit, Todd."
aww,Aww. I love a fawn Great Dane. So cute.
aww,I hope all these people who killed them afterwards for flesh and statisfication will feel a lot of guilty for killing those sweet little things ‚ù§Ô∏è

aww,"My adult daughter graduated from college last year and got her first ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù
job. I‚Äôve been letting her ‚Äúborrow‚Äù one of our dogs so that she‚Äôs not so homesick. She lives about 80 miles away so whenever we see each other, which is typically every other week, our dog is either coming back home to me or going back home with her.
Edit: She only takes one of our dogs, our 2 yr old westie and no, this one doesn‚Äôt get homesick too. I‚Äôve never had a dog like her who seems to fully embrace living in the moment. We always say she is like a party waiting to happen. Whether she is at the dog park playing with other dogs, watching tv (she LOVES tv) or just hanging out at the apartment she is pleasantly happy wherever she‚Äôs at. She is so extra that she even amuses herself by playing with two toys at the same time."
aww,Do you have a problem with that?
aww,Yeah it gave me the motts hearing about it.
aww,I meant to move back home.... and I wouldn't want her to be cramped

aww,"I don‚Äôt see dog, only adorable bear."
aww,Why are they mad though? :(

aww,Awww that's his personality!
aww,The barely audible mews are killing me!!

aww,Hahahaha! Now I'm imagining him in a leopard print bikini top!
aww,"He most definitely would have loved it. I can almost hear him doing his warming little chuckle. Saying ""ain't that just the neatest lil thing?'"
aww,"No, these are the dogs that drag the cat around on a leash even though the cat clearly doesn‚Äôt like it"
aww,"Shut da fuck up man. They got the dogs cataracts removed, it can see again. That isn't fucking heart warming as anything else you see?"

aww,What did it say
aww,Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for when trying to describe this animal!
aww,We just lost our golden due to other health reasons. He just couldn't get up unassisted anymore. He was a grandpa. He was also very blind. How much did that run you? If you don't mind. We considered the operation but with all the other health problems we didn't know if it made sense.
aww,And then yowl in unison to celebrate their sudden adulthood?
aww,"Ah the bremen mask march, I can still hear it in my head after all these years."
aww,Why do they have the same haircut? ü§î

aww,"My dad had a precious golden lab adopt him (she would literally come back to our house everyday) we named Cali. She was always a chonk. Her vets professional opinion of her was that she was ""a tank"". She was the golden version of your boy. They are the best. :) Cali-girl was one of the best dogs I've ever known. Give your boy a hug for me."
aww,This kitty is one day older than me! üéâ
aww,"The eggs aren't all laid at the same time. [Female ducks lay one egg per day until the clutch is complete,](https://www.ducks.org/conservation/waterfowl-research-science/understanding-waterfowl-the-amazing-egg) but the mother won't start incubating them until all of the eggs have been laid. Because the embryos inside the eggs don't develop until incubation starts, this ensures that all of the eggs hatch at about the same time, even if they were laid 18 days apart."
aww,Such a good boy! He deserves all of the cuddles and love. &lt;3
aww,"That's definitely not a lap dog.

I hope he‚Äôs doing great fam"
aww,But all of them are cute!!
aww,an absolute unit that pupper is
aww,"Yep, have my downvote"
aww,Boxer? Boxers fart a lot
aww,Yes I thought the same but I have seen chihuahuas and other smaller dogs that colour too so I kinda dismissed that thought mainly cause the face didn't match with that breed but it could be....damn can you imagine a Chihuahua and a rottweiler trying to make babies...that can't be easy lmao
aww,Cool it with the antisemitic remarks.
aww,My German Shepherd came running to attention as soon as he heard that whistle.

aww,"Very glad your kitty came home. Mine has run off about 9 days ago, and I‚Äôm extremely sad about it. She is very fluffy like Chewie. I‚Äôve made many efforts to find her but only following cold leads so far. This gives me at least a little hope that she‚Äôs still out there and ok and may just make her way home again. üòø"
aww,Conga! Aww they‚Äôre so cute!
aww,"Aww, I used to have a kitty that looked exactly like this. She was part Ragdoll and was super lovey."

aww,The only thing they'd attack are treats

Oh man, I miss him now. Your dog is beautiful."

aww,"In awe of the size of this lab, absolute unit"
aww,"I can be a very negative person, but the thought of giving my best friend his eyesight back?  I would walk into fire for that."
aww,"The negativity you are witnessing is essentially how the Russians manipulated, and continue to manipulate, our nation and our elections. 

A vast majority of Americans across all spectrums have been raised through fear, shame and guilt. As they get older they realize they're essentially damaged by this upbringing, specially when they come across people who were typically raised in more liberal households where there was less indoctrination. These miserable SOBs aggregate together to find solace and support, they also enjoy lashing out in a group to anyone and everyone who they see as unduly happy or secure -- knowing full well that at the center of all our hearts is the ability to break us and make us more like them rather than the other way around.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, fuck em. I'd save my pennies (which btw I first read as penises) and gladly donate them to help a dog be able to see again. They are equal parts of our family! Yes, it must be nice to love and be loved. This is also known as being blessed. Cheers"

aww,"I wish I had some money to help you but I needed to borrow the money to give my best old girl GSD a home euthanasia, that was the best I could do for her as she had lost all control of her hind end and continence. At well over 100 lbs and we live on the second floor of our house, a wheel chair would not work.

aww,"Our Jack went blind from cataracts and had diabetes.  My husband and I dutifully gave him insulin twice a day, strictly controlled his diet (no snacks) and gave him plenty of walks (twice a day, maybe more).  When he turned 3, we went to UC Davis Vet. School to have his cataracts removed.  Sure it was expensive...didn't care.  They did such a great job!!!   When we went to pick him up, he was supposed to run through an orange traffic cone course in a room so they/we could tell that he could now see.  He saw me from across the room, ran down the cones or around them in a bee-line for me.  We were told that since his diabetes started so early in his life, he would only live to be 7 years or so....he lived to be 14.  I will never forget that little dog..he has a huge piece of my heart and I dream of him often."

aww,Just wanted to add that dogs are stupid animals. They at utmost potential become roughly a 2 year old human child if they are at peak intelligence. They are one of the smartest animals on earth after humans but still overall are very dumb. Pugs for example are so genetically mutated they aren't even as smart as most cats or infants who cannot even speak or walk yet. Pug dogs are roughly 6 months old in human years when a bright one arises in terms of intellect.

If the animal has any chance to be released to the wild* (as you wouldn't want the wild animals seeing human's as a source of food or being too trusting of people.)

If they can never be released, it's just good enrichment for the animal and allows for the animal to be much more comfortable around their caretaker(s) (thus more comfortable in general)."

aww,no I agree with this that doesnt look like any pure husky Ive seen and I work at a dog kennel

aww,I fostered a Pomeranian and gave him a duck squeaky toy too! They look like twins.

Ask my boyfriend. We went to Arizona last month, and it was my first time down there and BOY there were cacti EVERYWHERE! I felt like an excited little kid! It was just so cool to see them everywhere and see the different kinds and shapes. I took home my own potted baby cactus. Best $20 I ever spent!"

aww,"Yeah, I've been pissing mine away too."
aww,Technically since they are red foxes and are invasive to our area if I had proper licensing I could have!
aww,Lol thank you. He is a pure Husky.
aww,"There are tons of snakes here to worry about. There are over 6 different variants of rattlesnakes, 3 different variants of copperheads, 3 different coral snakes, and then there are water moccasins. Sure, with immediate treatment you will more than likely survive a bite from almost any snake. However, that does not mean that getting bitten by a snake is a pleasant experience. In fact, it feels quite awfu. Just because it won't kill you (with immediate medical treatment, I must add) doesn't mean it won't seriously hurt and make you feel like absolute shit. It's definitely worth going out of your way to avoid bites from very many snakes here in NA. 

For example, every night whenever I have to go outside I get to play the game of ""spot the copperheads before I get bitten"". It's quite exhilarating, I've had quite a few close calls. Those bastards will chase you across the whole yard, they're insanely aggressive."
aww,Had us in the first half
aww,I love lab faces. Owning a black lab mix myself that face would make me move home in a minute. Our girl won us over with her sweet puppy face and puppy breath. She‚Äôll be 8 in September. I think she‚Äôs telling you to come home.

aww,Those are going to be some fluffy biscuits.
aww,"My wife was the same way. It took nearly 6 years but it took her no more than 2 minutes with this boy to say we are bringing him home. My advice (for what it‚Äôs worth) is let her get super comfortable and approving of getting a puppy before you do it. It is still a puppy, so everything is a chew toy and it is very frustrating for all parties. For me personally, depression, anxiety and paranoia has plagued me ever since my time in Iraq and this boy (even at 8 weeks old) brings an incredible amount  of comfort. I have never walked though my neighborhood before getting him, never met my neighbors....but he is a great buffer and brings an unexplainable entity to how I approach things. 

He is an incredibly handsome and loving dog but there is so much more that I get from him being here. 

Take your time and make sure you and your girlfriend are in the same place and you will find that it increases your livelihood and mental wellness incredibly. 

I hope the best for you both!"

aww,"Dang, I want to lead my own kitten parade now!"
aww,"And the sun rises and sets, the moon goes from new to full, and the seasons rapidly move from one to another. We exist within a rushing river of unending change, and there's beauty in capturing the spaces in between. I hope someday you can recognize and appreciate that beauty."

He just let's you stay because you feed him."
aww,Yah. Is there any problem with milk?
aww,And the darkening of the sweater
aww,"It's become super normal to let cats be ""outdoor cats"" even though indoor cats live longer, healthier lives, don't contribute to the extinction of bird and other small animal species, and are far less likely to encounter and spread diseases. Cats can go outside - as long as they're leash trained or being supervised while they're outside, but they should definitely have adequate enrichment (toys, food, places to rest or hang out) inside the house too. It's important to remember that while cats are great, loveable pets, they're also an invasive species that are killing off entire species of animals."
aww,"Thank you.  He is a really good dog.  My wife and I were living in an RV when we got him as she was unable to work and we didn't have a lot extra so to say I didn't think we could afford to have a dog is an understatement.  

&amp;#x200B;

Some people were giving away some puppies at Bass Pro Shops in OKC about a week before Thanksgiving.  I came outside and saw so I tried to hurry up and have the car waiting to get my wife.  By the time I pulled up to the curb she hat a little fluff ball in her hands and was very happy.  I couldn't tell her no.  Now I couldn't give him up for anything."

aww,"It‚Äôs better to try to not stress them. In this scenario best to give them water (place a bottle cap filled with water near, not next to, them) and walk away. Call a wildlife rehab facility and see when they can come by. If it‚Äôs gonna be a while (&gt;6hours) id look to make some watery slurry food. Dog food wouldn‚Äôt be great but people have it or cat food available so it would do in a pinch."

aww,American coots are also brood parasites of one another. The mother can't always keep track of which eggs are her own so she imprints on the first chick to hatch (most likely to be her own) and kills the chicks that are unlike it.
aww,Shoulda named him Arnold because he‚Äôll be back.
aww,American coots are also brood parasites of one another. They may abandon their brood of too many parasite eggs are deposited or they're deposited too frequently. The mother can't always keep track of which eggs are her own though so she imprints on the first chick to hatch (most likely to be her own) and drowns the chicks that are unlike it.
