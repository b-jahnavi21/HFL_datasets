Go to that special spot they like to just sit and be the best pup. Anything after 12 with a lab is bonus. I‚Äôm genuinely happy that you‚Äôve gotten so much time with your best friend. Mine passed over the Rainbow Bridge a year ago and I still miss her every day, I can feel her warm panting on my cheek and her sandpaper tongue kisses. I know she‚Äôs happy and running free from all the aches and pains of being an old girl which brings me comfort, it‚Äôs these moments where feel like I can‚Äôt wait to get there and see her again."

aww,"It seems like a genuine comment about her kids growing up too fast.  What joke are you seeing and why is it edgy, offensive, and dumb?"
aww,"What a sweet boy. I have had 2 dogs in my 49 years, dog \#1, Paco, was an 8yr old mutt my mom's friend had us temporarily watch while she went through divorce proceedings; it ended up being permanent and as the oldest at 14 of 3 siblings, we were all ecstatic. He was well trained and great with us; unfortunately we didn't have a fenced yard and one morning my dad let him out for his morning business and he didn't come back. My younger brother noticed a dog laying on the road when his bus passed by our sub and called my dad when he got to school; that's when my dad confirmed Paco hadn't come back and we later confirmed it was him. Not a month later, my mom crawls to my room in the middle of the night and says get your dad; she died due to complications from a ruptured brain aneurysm on mother's day of all fucking days a few weeks later. Dog \#2, raven, a 6 month old female black lab my then girlfriend and now wife found via coworker. Had her for 11 years, 6 of which were with our 3 kids and she was great. She ate a bag of grapes one day, started convulsing and died within a few hours. I love dogs but as much as my kids want another, we can't give them enough time. 2 sister cats and some fish are it for us until we retire and then we'll go adopt some mutt from a nearby shelter"

aww,"Seriously, I see people calling others the n word with fewer downvotes than that."

aww,"OP, my mom got a dog when I was about 12 that looked identical to this pupper. She was my best friend in the whole world. When I moved away, it killed me to be without her. I went through a very bad time, I got sick, I almost died, and when I was finally able to get out of my situation and move back in with my mom - Jan was there. We stayed with mom for three years until dad sprung a divorce on her and we had to move. Rather than take Jan, Mom told me to take her with me. It was one of the best choices I made in my entire life. That year, I got pregnant with my first son and she was at my side the whole time. She was there when he was born and immediately took to protecting him. We had to go back home with Mom and I decided that I was going to bring her back to the farm and she would live with my Mom for the rest of her days. I would have to go back home without her. It was one of the most heartwrenching things I had to do, but she was so happy to be home after almost five years of being away. By then, she was 14 and wearing out. But, I made it back to the farm for the birth of my second child.. and she was there. She loved those boys, slept next to them, cuddled them. She was such a loving, happy dog that she never showed when she got sick. She laid down one day and stopped eating.. stopped drinking. We tried to syringe feed her, and she would just stare at us with this look of agony. When she started to howl in pain, I was the one who took her to be put to sleep. She had cancer, and we never knew.

aww,"&gt;Good enrichment is actual social and environmental enrichment that mimics an animal‚Äôs natural environment‚Äîthat‚Äôs the whole point of enrichment. Interacting with humans doesn‚Äôt do that.

That's a very purist, idealist idea of what constitutes ""good enrichment"".

In most cases, it's simply not possible to even come close to replicating the animal's natural environment. 

The point of enrichment is to enhance the quality of captive¬†animal¬†care through providing the stimuli necessary for optimal psychological and physiological well-being. 

That can often involves activites that require interactions between the animal and its caretakers. 

And like I pointed out before, animals that are more comfortable around their caretaker(s) are more comfortable in general. 

Of course there are both wrong and right ways to do it. My point is just that not all interactions with the animals being cared for are unwarranted, unbeneficial, or unneeded. 

For instance, the AAZK's Suggested Guidelines for Bird Enrichment
states that ""operant conditioning can be a rewarding form of enrichment. Over time, birds can learn to respond to a number of cues and commands. 
Animal training programs should be well thought out and have attainable goals."""

aww,I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts...
aww,I feel bad for op
aww,WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE IN EACH PICTURE??!!??
aww,"I work with a fennec fox as as zookeeper. Ears back is very indicative of stress in them. Their body language can similar to dogs, but also can be very different. I've never seen our fox's ears go back unless he's super unhappy about what's happening (whereas in dogs this behavior is not always negative). It took me a long time working with our fox to truly learn to read his behavior, and I still occasionally misread him. It's very different than other canid behavior and even other fox behavior. All I can say is that is takes a lot of practice to be able to correctly interpret fennec box behavior, and I've had a lot of practice.

Also, he's very stiff in his stance. He's also showing side eye. This one is just like in dogs. When they stand very stiff like that they are tense. I said this in my last comment, but in this particular instance this looks very much like learned helplessness, which is where an animal (or person or whatever, it applies everywhere) essentially shuts down and just stays still to get through an inescapable/uncomfortable situation. 

Also, this is a true desert species that would pretty much never see water in its life, and certainly never be submerged in it. Ours doesn't even like hearing the sink running on the other side of the room. But anyways, I'm repeating myself. I've said all this before in the comment thread that's been linked all over these comments. Check out that comment if you want to learn more!"

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

All of my small critters are in my office, so it‚Äôs 7 guinea pigs, 4 rats (thankfully they are quiet), the 4 kittens, and their deadbeat mom who is just hiding under the cages wanting nothing to do with anyone or anything. It‚Äôs pretty ,,, cacophonous in there at feeding times."

She nursed them the first night we trapped them and then went and hid and hasn‚Äôt gone back to them. She won‚Äôt let me pick her up so I can‚Äôt force her. I‚Äôve tried. She had complete access to them, and sneaks in the pen where they are at night to eat, but doesn‚Äôt interact with them at all. She is actually crying right now, I can hear her. I don‚Äôt know what her deal is, in my decade of cat rescue I‚Äôve never had a momma cat act quite this way. I can‚Äôt even tell if she is feral or just still completely terrified and has no idea what‚Äôs happening. She seems perfectly healthy, so I‚Äôm trying to just let her do her thing and encourage her in every way I can think of to be with them (only leaving food in the pen, etc)."

I went from a super skeptic to a believer. I‚Äôd given her every med available to help her and the only thing that did was the acupuncture. If you‚Äôd read up on it, it‚Äôs great for pain treatment. 

‚ÄúSome experts have used neuroscience to explain acupuncture. Acupuncture points are seen as places where nerves, muscles, and connective tissue can be stimulated. The stimulation increases blood flow, while at the same time triggering the activity of the body's natural painkillers.‚Äù

Hi! Definitely move back!! But have a job in place haha  14? Wow! Fine wine! 

I so want to upload my dogs pics to reddit, but I just hate the fact that people will repost it for karma like it‚Äôs their dog. 

I have an infinite amount of cute pics that will melt peoples hearts. 

Point is to be with him!! 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I lost my 11yr old Black Labrador 3 months ago.  I‚Äôd do anything to pet and kiss and touch smell his paws again!! Kinda still mad at myself that I didn‚Äôt really let him kiss me. 
Was depressed for 5 years b/c of acne. Every time he‚Äôd kiss me on my face, a pimp would pop up lol so I didn‚Äôt let him kiss me :(
I still cry every time someone mentions his name or anything related,,be with him/her!! Your pups 14!! +you get to be with your mom! 

These past couple months have been such a roller coaster. 

He was the best childhood friend I could ask for. Thank god I had him for 11yrs growing up from 7th grade to senior in college. 

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends growing up. / He was the only friend I thought I needed so I didn‚Äôt care to make friends and put myself out there.
(God the feeling of coming home to him after a long day! :D ;) :p ^.^) 

/just really didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúfriend luck.‚Äù (Now that I look back most of real friends throughout my life like all moved to diff. states) [everybody has a bad luck in their life]  Like damn, my luck with friends,,,drives me insane. And I‚Äôm the type that will treat my friends like bloodlines. Will do anything for the realist fams. 


B/c of Accutane, trying to graduate, work, family health issues, I lost all senses with life in general..
[excuses excuses,, tsk tsk,,  :( ] 
I will always feel sorry that I didn‚Äôt live the best life with him. I regret it so much. 

When he passed, that‚Äôs when it hit me. The unconditional love he gave me was so so so big and surreal. My heart aches every night coming home to an empty house. 

I honestly can‚Äôt wait to give that same unconditional love he gave me to my SO in the future! 




‚Äî There‚Äôs not a day that goes by where I don‚Äôt think of you. Forever and Always in my heart. 

I love you CoCo! ‚Äî"

aww,"That crying/whimpering and how much you can tell they miss you broke me more than any relationship has. 

We lived on a farm as a kid and I had a Belgian Shepard she was a big black scary looking utter sweetheart and my best friend, after I moved out of home my parents said she was never the same, she‚Äôd sit there every night staring up the hallway to my room and would lay at my outside door during the day doing nothing just waiting, still makes me turn into a mess to think about how she had no idea why I wasn‚Äôt there anymore."

&amp;#x200B;

There are different classifications for AR and it affects people in different ways. The inflammation (your own immune system attacking your own body, mainly joints, is the common ground). There are probably multiple factors that play in such as genes, gut bacteria, over all health and diet.

&amp;#x200B;

I don‚Äôt remember the last time I said goodbye to my moms puppy that I shared 15 years of my life with. It came sudden for him. 

And while I say my moms pup, he really was my moms first, but I was his second. My dad his third and my brother his fourth. Growing up, when my mom wasn‚Äôt around, he was my dog. And we used to play all the time. I‚Äôd chase him around and play with toys. While I don‚Äôt like prescribing dogs to ‚Äúhe‚Äôs your brother‚Äù kind of things, he really was like a brother of sorts to me. 

The first night that he came home with my family, he was scared and shaking and didn‚Äôt know what to do. I literally curled up with him on our bigger dogs bed while the family watched tv or a movie, and fell asleep with him. 

Anyway, later in his life, he developed this issue with his trachea. He would bark and then have to cough for 2 minutes and would stop and feel defeated but eventually try again. It wasn‚Äôt so bad in calm moments, but when worked up it was an issue.

Later he shifted worse and he was no longer able to be comfortable and wasn‚Äôt breathing well. My mom made the call and had him put to sleep.

When she called to tell me it oddly didn‚Äôt affect me... I was away on a summer internship in a different part of the state,and was working. I think the last time I saw him was Christmas. I never got my goodbye or final pup kisses or last time chasing him around or throwing a toy. 

Later that night when I finished work and was crawling into bed it hit me. And I cried in silence as I had a roommate who was asleep. I got up and took a shower so I could cry it out without being to obvious. 

So... spend the time to make sure you get a proper goodbye with your pupper. I had no reason to think my lil guy was going to pass as soon as he did. It went from ‚Äúokay‚Äù to ‚Äúnot okay‚Äù to ‚Äúnot recoverable‚Äù in less then a week. I still miss that idiot pup.... and I probably always will."

aww,I moved to Australia for 2 years (finishing up now will be home in 2 months) it was super exciting and awesome but leaving my dogs was The Hardest part. I visited half a year and 3 months in and i was more excited to see my dogs than anyone. A few months after I went back one of them got really sick and luckily I was able to video chat my mom and sister and brother and be there through video chat when we had to put him down. That is what sold me on not staying here longer to study. I can‚Äôt handle having my other dog pass while I‚Äôm away. Dogs are just so fucking great I love them.

It was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. But I weighed all the pros and cons of how it would affect my dog if I moved him with me. I discussed it with his other dad and we came to the mutual decision that staying with him was what is best. As we can easily transfer money to each other on our bank app, I'm able to help with cost of care. I usually put in ""Child Support "" on the note line when I transfer money. He finds it hilarious."

aww,That's my dogs favorite ball too
aww,"I once spoke to a guy who researched the 'evolutionary arms race' between cuckoos and a host species they use to raise their young in england and it was super interesting!

The cuckoo has to time it's placement exactly right because if it lays the egg in an empty nest the host knows it's not theirs (and they may even abandon the nest altogether). If it lays the egg after the host is done laying, the host also knows something is wrong. But if it lays the egg in between the host laying sessions, the host is least likely to notice the difference. There was also a difference between hosts laying eggs for the first time ever or more 'experienced' egg layers. The spots and patterns on eggs are to make it easier to spot the fraudulent eggs.

I hope I remembered it correctly, but it was a super interesting talk!"

If a cat only lightly wags the tip of the tail, it shows it's content and chill.
If the whole tail snaps sharply from left to right - so, like dogs wag theirs - it's either nervous, hunting, or aggressive.

It's easier to tell a cat's mood from the eyes though. If they are squinted and almost closed, it's calm and comfortable."

When we moved house there was a large field between our garden and the by-pass main road. He brought in dozens of dead voles he found the few weeks we had him at that house until he strayed too far and was killed on that by-pass. Miss you Spooky."

Not everyone is cut out for forming bonds and then having to break them, the point is they tried and should be respected for that alone."

The dogs love it, the owners love it knowing their best friends are getting the care they need, and she loves it because she gets the fun of a four legged friend whenever she wants without the problems of leaving them alone when she's working her shifts as a police officer.

aww,"I have a matching scarf from an Aboriginal local designer from where I live in Canada. The pattern is the exact same.  I'm so buying this!!!

Just did my taxes recently. Biggest return in 16 years of work. Almost 10K cause I hit the jackpot with my new accountant. Maybe I live under a rock. I don't know. But I've been probably 8 out of these years without medical beneifits. I didn't know I could claim those expenses. As well as all the receipts pertaining to energy efficient products bought. My bus pass. I keep a receipt for mostly everything. So after doing this years. I went home and compiled all of what I could find. 

I feel like I can now lead my best female girlie life and afford to shop brand new. As well as be better put together. Take care of my esthetic needs better. I'm 32 and on my 10th year adulting outside of my parents house. Being HD Instagram ready hasn't been a priority. I used to be more invested in being a girl superficially. I was a Brooke Davis from One Tree Hill or Cordelia from Buffy type as a teen and living under my parents roof. With depth, compassion, and intelligence mind you. I just never wanted to be in debt whilst in University in the name of vanity. I just finished my masters in engineering last year. It took 12 years but I did it slowly to avoid insurmountable student debt. 

So the overly proud good karma filled me has made this very long winded. More or less this is literally going to be the first brand new item I've been able to let myself buy that I want so badly in almost half a decade. So thank you!"

However, while I did that the chipmunk hid somewhere in the house.  I looked and looked but couldn‚Äôt find it.  I ended up having to let the cat out so that she could show me where it was hiding.  The cat did a beeline for our china cabinet a few seconds after I opened the basement door.   It was amazing how quickly she found it.

She was really upset when I picked her up and put her back in the basement.  I think she thought I was just teasing her at that point."

It has given him hope and he's looking forward to his future for the first time since he got diagnosed. We will, and have done, everything in our power to help him and make sure he is here for the Long haul (Duchenne MD doesn't have a wonderful outcome). I'm sorry if getting this therapy offends some or burns their ass, but I have absolutely NO regrets. Those butt hurt would probably think differently if it was their own child who was stuck in a wheelchair and more than likely not going to make it to their 20s."

aww,Yup maybe at a shelter why imprison your dog at his forever home. Go ahead and justify it tho lol
aww,This is a much happier outcome than when a bird found its way into my house. I have cats.
aww,I've never understood this complaint.  Do you not clean food prep surfaces before cooking?  Because an uncleaned counter is worse than one that has been cleaned after a cat walked on it.
aww,"No way, that's funny. I have an Anatolian Pyrenees"
aww,Apparently.  Madonna is a pirate now.
aww,"Hey!
Obvious things being obvious.
Dog could be alleegic to the food you give him.
If he's only almost always in the garden he probably eats. He doesnt look emaciated.

The owners could charge you with trespassing.

What temperature has it been outside?

The dog looks comfortable and isnt panting besides when it comes to see you.

Do you have any kind of relationship with the owners?

Idea : 
Meet the owners. Tell them about how the dog brightens your day every day. Buy the dog a large water bowl at this point. Give it to the owners as a gift and a thank you for having a good dog. Make it clear without being rude that the one you got is an outdoor water bowl."

They turned out to be pretty good mousers, we never even knew we had an issue until the cats caught one.  I did take some away from them if it was still uninjured because blood on light carpet isn‚Äôt fun to clean."

Rule #1: No ""sad"" content, such as pics of animals that have passed away (try /r/petloss) or sob stories (e.g. found him in a dumpster).

* Your title must be ""100% happy"". No mentioning death, injury, RIP posts, finding abandoned animals, sick/survived cancer, pets being put to sleep, ""I miss..."", etc. &gt; You may tell the complete story, unhappy parts and all, in the comments section.

aww,"Hey waiter, I think there‚Äôs something wrong with my rice, it‚Äôs looking at me"
aww,Face says:  For this you shall pay a terrible price!
aww,"Completely agree when it comes to Baseball but I feel Football does it well. Penalties and time outs not withstanding, the time between plays is short enough to not be boring while adding a bit of suspense. A lot of people use this for every sport but I do feel Football is the one sport where the more you understand it, the more you appreciate it, as the down time between plays gives you time to think about what each team is going to do or what you would do in that situation.

Baseball I will never understand though. Literally 90% of the game is just standing around or sitting in the dug out even when you're actively ""playing"". Had a really good arm in High School and the baseball coach, who was also the gym teacher which is how he found out, kept trying to get me on the team but the game just bored the ever living crap out of me, and that's playing... never mind watching. To those that enjoy it, more power to ya, but I will never understand it."

aww,"Looks like someone used Sleep on him/her.

Adorable little cat though. Great toe beans."
aww,That's some fluffy rice. Well done!
aww,This is yet another example of people seeing what they want to see in an animals expression. The dog isn‚Äôt showing a busted glance because the dog isn‚Äôt busted because the dog didn‚Äôt take the eggs.
aww,Yes..the way u use this thing is only limited by ur imagination..and ur furry friend
aww,Brother needs to wash his god damned pillowcases.
aww,To be fair that cat is not inside the rice cooker bowl/container. Rice cooker has separate bowl where you put the rice in. The cat is just sitting on the spring section where food is not supposed to go in there.

aww,True enough. She's an evil little witch when she wants to be. My old Maine coon was also a fluffy little psychopath. He'd pull all the legs off the big spiders that came in the house and sit and watch their legless bodies waiting for something to happen.

aww,"I don't like eating at cat people houses for this reason. No offense, but its very rare I meet people who actively discourage their cats from jumping on the counters / tables. 

Also people who let the dog sleep in their human bed. Why you do this?

Edit: I am honestly confused at how controversial this is. Cats literally walk in the litter box and floor and dog hair in your nose / dander on your skin during sleep has been proven to be harmful. Not to mention the damage you are doing to hierarchical structure in the dogs mind / you and your partners own pair bonding."
aww,"Yeah i was like: ""....Wut? "" lol"
aww,Like a little bear. What a cutie!
aww,Seriously. Who even puts food directly on the counter? Mine goes either onto a plate or a cutting board.

aww,Well I can already do it easily on the stove. Just was always tempted with the even easier rice cooker
aww,"The cat is not sitting in the rice cooker bowl/container where you are supposed to put the rice in. He is just sitting on the outside of it, where there's a spring underneath and an electrical contact to heat up the bowl. You are not supposed to get food or liquid in that section unless you wanna short circuit it."

aww,Whats wrong with his eye?
aww,"at one of my favorite little chinese places they use a rice cooker.  Since I tried it in the oven though, I haven't used a rice cooker since.  I make a big pan and keep it in a zip lock bag in the fridge then if i don't eat it all i put it in the freezer.  It's awesome."
aww,"Man: {showing off for friends}

aww,This made me awww
aww,I love cats but gross
aww,We do let my 6 pound Yorkie sleep in our bed. She has a tiny bed she curls up in next to us. We wash her paws after she comes in from her potty breaks and she gets a weekly bath. She rarely goes outside but is always cleaned up when she comes back in. The reason we let her sleep in the bed is because she's so Gawd damned cute we cannot resist her.
aww,I think child is also trying to say 'poop'!!

aww,"Meh, it's pretty simple really. It's concentrated to short exciting bursts.  
 There's build up and anticipation before and after plays.   
This happens when runners are on base, you get deep in the count for baseball while in football it's 3rd and longs, getting in the red zone.  

In football, any play can be one of the most exciting play of the season.  
To appreciate baseball, you need to appreciate pitching and defense.  
I'll say this, let's not pretend like we're on the edge of our seats for 90 minutes of football (soccer) it also comes in waves.   
In the end, to each their own really."

I have a husky that sits and stares philosophically into the distance everyday when people are likely to be out. I‚Äôve been told he looks stoic and sad separately. He‚Äôs really just waiting for his cats who are on an adventure to come home so he can sniff them down and clean them. 

So if you want to give him water that‚Äôs fine, but chances are, he has water, he just likes to be outside."

She lives inside in her own room and wears a diaper. She is super sweet and affectionate and loves to be around us. She hangs out with us, watches movies. and likes to harass my macaws and bite their tails. She‚Äôs a wonderful pet, we love her so much.

aww,"My cat once came inside carrying a mouse that had caught in a trip. Which means my cat was either stealing credit, or actually set the trap. 

I never knew my cat to be a liar, so I must conclude she's a genius who acquired and set the trap herself."

aww,You throw it oft the couter or clap loudly. The cat won't climb it if people are there atleast
aww,The counter/stove isnt safe for animals. It's not always about cleanliness. I would feel awful if my cat jumped onto a hot burner because I didn't train him not to jump on the counter.
aww,Why did I really expect it to be rice tho
aww,I didn't do it nor did I have any say in the matter my mom saved him from the animal shelter and he was declawed before we got him

aww,"I have a weird cat. He LOOOOOOVES the sound of foil/crinkle sounds. He will play with it, batting it around, rolling in it, etc. And he is the brat that likes the kitchen counters. We have sprayed the counter, sprayed him, shooed him away, done everything, he still goes up there. Ornery shite."
aww,Awww ! He looks like bear in the big blue house xp
aww,"She wants you to eat it, it a present from her."

Plus it‚Äôs not even the cooking part. It‚Äôs the metal part you put the plastic cooking pot in."
aww,I am shedding happy tears for you!!! Great work and all the best to you and your son!
aww,"I don‚Äôt let my cat on any counters or tables. I don‚Äôt put my feet or ass on the table, so why should she? I also wipe down the counters every single time I cook, and don‚Äôt prepare food directly on the counters anyway. Just because people have cats doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt know how to keep their house clean or their food surfaces sanitary."
aww,"Well, the second time this was reposted, the dog had been outside for 3 minutes. I hope next time it'll be 5."
aww,WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE!!!!!
aww,"What I did with my guys is, when they bite, take their lip, turn it in on one of their little razors (aka, puppy teeth) and make him give a little yelp.  I did this to my most recent pup and honestly, within a day or two, he stopped."
aww,"I love how they both have this shocked look of ""what?"""
aww,Took me some time to find mouse in the picture
aww,I see no god up here other than me üò∫
aww,This makes me want a third cat
aww,"Yeah, where‚Äôs the pun in that?"
aww,That did make me smile!
aww,"Our cat did that too!  It was worse when my kiddo was a toddler, it got to the point where we would do a mouth and paws check before letting the cat back in in the middle of the night.  Those 2am mouse chases are no joke.

Come to learn that cats do that for their babies (bring injured mice back to their nest/home) so that the kittens can start learning how to hunt.  My cat has always been very protective of my kiddo, and I'm guessing that it had to do with my kid becoming more independently mobile and ""ready"" to learn how to hunt.

It stopped after a couple of years, and my cat went back to leaving us dead mice instead of bring in half dead ones and releasing them.

So basically, if your cat is doing this it's because they think you need some hunting practice.  Aren't you lucky."
aww,"I rescued a (young) kitten outside my office 2 years ago and she has the same issue. I never got it diagnosed as the vet said the ultrasound would cost a good bit and if it was a brain condition there wasn't anything I could do anyway.  She is an extremely happy and adorable cat now and the wobble got a bit better over time, she still walks like her knees don't bend though."
aww,That's the real question.
aww,You just listed a bunch of reasons why to keep your cat indoors. *always*.
aww,Is it also one table spoon of salt?
aww,"He was confined to a wheelchair since 2017. He still had a decent amount of upper body strength. When he wasn't in his wheel chair, he would crawl (dragging his legs behind him)...doing that is basically what prepped him for being able to use the walker"

aww,"My cat was indoor/outdoor at our old house, now under vet's orders at the new house he's indoor only while we try and figure out what he's suddenly become allergic to.

My cat was definitely healthier when he could go outside.  He used to hike with us on the trails in the woods behind our old place, and he was super strong and lean from all the exercise.  Plus he was calm and happy when he was inside.

Now we have to watch how much we feed him because he was starting to get fat from lack of exercise.  He's definitely lost muscle mass, and now he looks like the old man cat that he is (he's 16 and super healthy other than the sudden allergies).  He's bored with his toys.

At this rate I'm thinking of getting a harness and a leash so that he can go outside a little bit at least.  The poor dude hates being stuck inside, and it's aged him faster in the last six months than the six months prior to that.  At least I'd like to see him get his muscle back."

Train your animals and do what you can to be as sanitary as possible, including both cleaning your food prep areas AND not allowing animals ON these surfaces. Or continue to be lazy and make excuses. Which is what you were planning on doing anyway, right, given that you can't be bothered to control the animal you choose to acquire."

aww,Yes I understand that and think most people do. That doesn't mean it's something you want to think about while eating.

aww,That wide stance. I may never have empathised more with an animal.
aww,It's a munchkin cat and they are bred that way and have some serious back issues later in life because cats legs aren't meant to be that short.
aww,"Stupid question, but how do they get the Husky to breed with the  Pomeranian or do they do invitro (lol)?"
aww,"&gt; Why do people seem to treat reposts like they‚Äôre evil...?

Because they are insecure babies.  They see people enjoying a post they haven't seen yet and they just *have* to let everyone know they've seen it first!

It's quite pathetic."

aww,Look at that smile!!!
aww,"Dude you are so defensive. Fuckin take a breath and chill. We get it your dog is your best friend but think about it, your dog does kinda look like he‚Äôs wishing you‚Äôd take him out back with a twelve gauge into the woods. Honestly it looks like that would be a blessing. And you know why? ZERO context. So when someone makes a comment out of concern with pure intentions and obvious care and you instantly become aggressive and start telling people to fuck themselves really that does not look good. 

Get your dog assessed because judging by your personality I‚Äôd say you neglect doing that for fear of what they may find and what it means. Just because your dog doesn‚Äôt cry or howl or show it at all doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt in pain and it could be possible you‚Äôd never know. But acting like that especially towards someone you don‚Äôt know on the internet doesn‚Äôt bode well."
aww,"Max was more or less a rescue. It was one of those situations where a family bought their young daughter Max as a ""starter pet"", then a year later the girl got a puppy, lost interest in Max, and so he fell by the wayside. Luckily the girl's grandmother, who was a coworker of my Mom's, had some empathy for him and so he ended up with my Mom instead of going to a shelter. [His nails all looked like this when she got him.](https://i.imgur.com/GZiw8sk.jpg)

Please don't treat small animals / rodents as disposable ""starter pets"", and in general don't buy an animal if you're not willing or able to care for it for its lifespan."

It‚Äôs just me and my Mom, not married and don‚Äôt have kids, Noche and Dee were my kids. Our home is eerily quite which makes their absence more noticeable and the missing them worse. We‚Äôre trying to cope but both have a good cry often. It‚Äôs just gonna take time and so it will for your wife and kids too. Gypsy, like Noch and Dee, was a part of your family, and is now no longer there, and if difficult to wrap one‚Äôs mind around. Things will get better."

aww,"One of my cats has no common sense, especially for actually being quite intelligent. No matter what we do, he won't stop jumping on the counters. It's been years. I have tried the foil trick, sprays, and other things. He finds ways around it somehow. 

Hes even burned himself on the stove like once or twice. Like, he burned his little paw and his nose. It was a few years ago, but I figured he finally learned his lesson.

Well I guess he forgot, because recently I've seen him wander to the stove again. 

The other one doesnt jump on the counter at least."
aww,I just had to smile after this

One pound of canned cat food is like $2, but a pound of chicken thighs is 99 cents per pound in most major supermarkets.

Stop feeding your cats the garbage that's in canned cat food! It's like 80% garbage filler!"
aww,THAT LITTLE BOW TIE THO!!!!
aww,They are indeed üòÅ. To you and yours too x
aww,"Dude everything in japan looks japanese its crazy. There is a lake with crabs that have samuri faces on their shells.

But an episode of Cosmos with Carl Sagan explained it. Over centuries fishermen would keep the crabs without that mutation to eat and throw the ones with samuri faces back into the lake. Over time that trait took over in the gene pool so you have a lake filled with samuri crab.

A lot of Japan is like this its an example of the aesthetics of ones culture being influenced by nature and its enviroment and vice versa.

Art imitating life , life imatating art on the large scale."
aww,Ah this brings me back memories. I also had to leave my chocolate lab to go to university and spent years away. Every time I saw him again he would do this. Unfortunately I lost him at 11 this year and it destroyed me.  üíî

After we got our own dog my parents used up come pick him up and take him camping with them.  They do lots of camping."
aww,"I think it depends. Japan has low birth rates and it‚Äôs really affecting them, but developing nations have high birth rates and that is a major cause of poverty."
aww,"Exactly. Thats what people don't realize about bears, you dont have to send them to harvard. A state school is perfectly fine."

aww,"I love old dogs they're more chill,calm and sweet."
aww,"Right, it‚Äôs not a big deal! Just wipe your counters."
aww,"Aww, that little snout poking out."
aww,I‚Äôve never gotten why people assume pet owners who let their cats drag feces particles around their kitchen are otherwise clean individuals.  That‚Äôs like changing a baby‚Äôs diaper on a food prep surface. Why would you assume someone who did that would care about  thoroughly cleaning up afterward?
aww,Congrats to you dudes! Get it buddy!!
aww,My understanding of DMD is that it‚Äôs a progressive disorder with a genealogical component. Do these injections address the gene issue? How much symptom free time does this round of injections buy him?

Also - this is awesome. Well done."
aww,"It's hard to do for the front legs but you basically get 2 long socks, have 1 inside the other and then you cut the elastic part down enough to tie be able to wrap around the leg and tie it off. Chewing on it typically will make a sound loud enough that you hear and you can yell at them to stop. I wish I still had some pictures to explain it better but it works well for them to not get great purchase on what they are trying to scratch. Couple that with a shirt like this dog has and it's a cheap way to get them to not scratch at stitches."

Once we got there, what you see started to happen. She hadn‚Äôt moved like that in years. 

She lived to 16 and a half before her quality of life declined to where we put her down. Only time I‚Äôve been aware of my dad openly crying (they were very close)."
aww,"I grew up with a cocker spaniel. Played with her daily until I got to my teens and started being too busy to play with her due to school and too much videogames. She was nevertheless always extremely enthusiastic to see me right up until she escaped our garden and got ran over during the night by a drunk driver.

She still crawled back to the house somehow, and died on our driveway. I found her the next morning. She was 16 at the time, a couple months younger than I was. That was 22 years ago, I still grieve for my friend.

Enjoy these days, you'll remember them for longer than you can imagine."
aww,Awww i just wanna give her all the hugs.

aww,So Edgar Sawtelle is realistic?
aww,I need to boop her nose right now
aww,"Mine does the vomiting thing too, but some dogs just smirk. This one in the gif is just smirking...

Edit to add: Yes dogs can wag their tails when they are happy. Dogs are also known to mimic human expressions, including smiling.

aww,If I had gold I'd give you all of it
aww,That is a very unhealthy cat with abusive (or straight up negligent) owners.
aww,why did he not climb over the walls?
aww,`The thumbnail looked like a cat in a vase with it head sticking out.
aww,Tank looks like one of those kid bean bags...
aww,"Man, I see a ton of genuinely aww things on here (mostly puppies), but this made me so happy. I love seeing your dog like this. He looks like he‚Äôs in great shape! I hope my buddy makes it to 13 like yours. Thanks for sharing"
aww,This hamster is smarter than most ppl
aww,"Says the man with a dog most obviously in pain but refuses to do the right thing and instead tells people giving good but hard to swallow advice to fuck themselves. 

Get your head out of your ass dude. I hope one day you‚Äôll go through what this dogs going through and suffer because you won‚Äôt have the luxury of having someone help you end it."
aww,At first I thought it was theladyshortcake but I don‚Äôt think it is. You should follow her anyway. Her posts make me so happy!
aww,You all ready have by loving your pup but I‚Äôll be waiting for day that you stop loving that pup. Then that‚Äôs when I‚Äôll spring into action with phase two of the operation.

aww,Pit bulls have got to be one of the cutest types of dog
aww,"And they can have a wolf or snake as an enemy. Real tragedy, sadness, and one brave... bunny/chicken/rooster(?) that saves the hen house daycare from the evil snake/wolf.  


Now if only i knew who to talk to. Or how to even find who to talk to."
aww,Damn white people. Pets don't go in cooking appliances.
aww,"This reminds me of the one time I thought it would be funny (I was 11) to put my cat on the my drawer. It had a heart shaped hole instead of a handle, so I could look in. I put her in there one day, and it turned out the joke was on my because she loved it and it became her drawer so I couldn‚Äôt close it and left a lining of very cat hair covered sweaters for her to lay one."
aww,"Awe!  What a quality table!!  Sturdy, fine legs, perfect finish with no flaws, and will brighten any decor!"
aww,Careful your low effort is showing
aww,"I get that you made the comment out of caring
and that is a great thing if you can actually influence an owner to prevent a dogs suffering. But Cody isn‚Äôt suffering. His degenerative diseAse causes loss of function, but it is not painful. He still loves his walks and food, people and other dogs. He‚Äôs a very happy boy."
aww,"Your thought process is pretty flawed. I dont care if it's a food prep surface or not, I'm cleaning any surface i just changed a baby on, and I take the used diaper outside to the dumpster right away.

My house is pretty immaculate despite having two cats. Do you breath in your home? Do you realise that even without pets the air in your home is absolutely polluted with dead human skin, feces from every time you fart or flush the toilet, insect parts, dust, allergens, ect?

You gotta either buy yourself a bubble to live in or learn to relax a little."
aww,This stuff makes me tear up. Looking forward to getting dog when I'm more financially stable.
aww,‚ÄúHey!  You‚Äôre letting all the heat out!‚Äù
aww,That is one damn cute dog
aww,God I love dogs
aww,"When kept in a great environment, they are American Terriers. not Pit Bulls.  Big love."
aww,Think your dog is just a bit too jowly for the smile to show through.  Sure you're a great animal mom!
aww,Up up down down left right left right ba select start
aww,That is the cutest thing to be cute.
aww,"Lost my boy to that shitty disease.  Never in pain, but the lost of function in his back legs killed me.  Best dog ever and we didn't get to have him anywhere near long enough.  Glucosamine was the only thing that sort of helped, but honestly it is just about making them as comfortable as you can.  He is super cute.  Pet him lots for me in memory of my puppers."
aww,"is she really ""smiling"" tho"

You don‚Äôt know shit. Now go back to your shitty life and fester in being a loser."
aww,Hate to break it to you but your cat is gay
aww,Yeah I know what pair ponding is. How does having a dog in the bed damage that? Are there any legitimate sources backing that up?
aww,Awwwww! This made my morning. :)
aww,::::::sigh:::::::: to make another life that happy is amazing. what a beautiful smile!
aww,"LOVED that show!

Edit: I just looked it up for nostalgia's sake and realized that they are still airing this show! I watched back in the 1990s/2000s!"
aww,"I thought this was stolen from a comment that got gold, but then I realized the same person posted it. Great pun!

Go home r/punpolice!"
aww,"Who mentioned essential oils? Did a quick Google search and found [a legit scientific paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032845/) talking about this. Just because something isn't a a white pill does not mean it is alternative medicine, you are almost as bad as the people you are criticizing."
aww,This is something that always makes my brain hurt. It‚Äôs like dolphins. Those motherfuckers look happy all the time. We make em do tricks and they look they‚Äôre smiling so we‚Äôre like ‚Äúhaha cute dolphin smiles huehuehue‚Äù but it could be angry as fuck. It‚Äôs like when dogs pant and people ‚Äúaw he‚Äôs smiLIN‚Äù no bitch he‚Äôs stressed or hot
aww,I think he's panting.
aww,Can‚Äôt believe this thread devolved into a cat‚Äôs on counters discussion and no one is worried about whether that cat could get oxygen if that lid is fully closed.. this is likely dangerous
aww,"The same thing we do every night, Pinky."

aww,You're person won't give you pizza either? ;)
aww,Awwwwww!I wanna ask you to draw my dog but I won‚Äôt. :)
aww,"Yeah you really got to start em off young, they can get addicted to dry food for some reason. Probably the salt content.

Of course if you stop providing the dry food your cat will definitely start eating the chicken. One of my cats started eating chicken as soon as I started making it for her, the other took a while to get used to it."
aww,They smile while they pant too
aww,Ducky. My old dog had a ducky
aww,This kid is me watching football.
aww,Lol dude I don‚Äôt like people telling me to put my dog down. I haven‚Äôt used the tank in a long time though. Really cool of you to go deep into my profile for material. I wouldn‚Äôt even click yours.
aww,All of the above
aww,I'm not up on my GoT but I saw this scene and it's truly amazing. I really like Brienne as a character and Gwendoline acted the ***shit*** out of this scene! It just feels so real!
aww,I'm not sure what that's in reference to but in the USA there are no hormones allowed on chickens so it wont turn you into a woman lol.
aww,Pittybulls = cuddle pups
aww,OMG how adorable! This only solidified my need for alpacas ü¶ô
aww,"Well I've seen it work for more than one cat, though obviously I never claimed this works with every cat as they often have wildly different personalities. The foil isn't a permanent thing, they made the mistake a few times and then they just didn't jump onto those surfaces again foil or not."
aww,How about we stop cropping dogs ears
aww,"By becoming a chonkster, you have given him more girth to assert his dominance."
aww,"This is a complicated question. Ha. I'm not 100% sure on the answer. What I DO know is that prior to the therapy, his muscles would not accept proteins which cause them to become useless and waste away. AFTER the therapy, his muscles are now able to accept those proteins and he is working hard to build up those muscles that started to disintegrate."
aww,"Honestly after getting 3x gold I was like, ""I cant believe this has never been posted, I better steal my comment before someone else does!"""
aww,"We used to have a Doberman and moved down to South Australia where it was pretty cold for a short haired dog. So Mum would get jumpers from the op shop and a bit cut off the sleeves.

She would get excited to get her jumper on. She loved to lay just outside out drive way in the sun in her jumper. Several people stopped at the sight."
aww,Just look at those (not-so-little) paws!
aww,Sounds like you found the reason foil doesn't freak him out in that last sentence ..
aww,Mine just want to smell them. I‚Äôve given them an actual strawberry. They smelled it and proceeded to look at me with that ‚Äúwell what am I suppose to do with this you insolent fool‚Äù look.
aww,But I prefer watching with my toes :(

aww,"I don't feed it to them raw, I cook it for safety. I'm really not an expert on raw diets."

aww,"Puppy body, old man eyes"
aww,"This is how i officially know GOT is dead. When r/aww is awwing about it

Edit: you know people who read the books are extremely dissapointed right?  I mean the dialogue is not even close to the same levels as the first 4 seasons.... Its a completley different show.

Edit 2: every downvote is like a stab into aryas gut.. It dont matter tho. Keep crying kids üôã"
aww,And how about we stop giving excuses of why we cropping dogs ears
aww,"The process was simple and non-invasive. They gave him 4 injections of stem cells into his stomach using a large syringe. They also have him another injection into an IV that he had in his arms. Side effects we're close to none. The spots of injection were sore for a few days, but that's it. And he is expected to continue to progress. MD effects the lungs (as well as other organs/muscles), so in november, when he went to his pool Physical Therapy, he was able to hold his breath for 23 seconds. A month post-therapy, he was able to hold.it for 47 seconds. Today, he is able to hold it for over a minute!"
aww,Don‚Äôt kill her majestic dreams
aww,Thought he was gonna do a celebratory slide...
aww,"Yes it‚Äôs a shitty disease. Other ppl in here are
Telling me I need to put him down bc he‚Äôs in pain but I am trying to tell them the disease isn‚Äôt painful just loss of function. I have found keeping him mobile is the best thing, which gets harder and harder as it progresses obviously."
aww,"Precisely what I expected, you didn't even read the TITLE of that study.    


"" Improves Urinary Disorder in Human Overactive Bladder""  


Just picked a random one from google that seemed to agree with what Moonbeam Von Oilstein up here was parroting."

aww,I think that suit might be too big for you Gordon.
aww,He ready to take on the world
aww,"I posted the original vid last night of when he jumped on my hand and mentioned that I had this as well. I‚Äôm still trying to figure Reddit out so I don‚Äôt know how to link the two but for all those who wanted to see this, here it is!"
aww,I love it üòÇ
aww,"This reminds me of my black lab Remmi, she had the same grey beard and lived to 16! Enjoy all the time you have with that guy."
aww,This is clearly reversed.
aww,"I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying"
aww,"Just like my 12 year old good boy, he naps most of the day and doesn't like getting up but when I take him for a walk he has so much energy he would pull me right over if he didn't have a nose harness on. I'll be very sad when he gets tired enough that he doesn't want to go on walks anymore :("
aww,"It was at my parent's house, I'm not sure how willing my dad would be about putting them on the windows but I'll bring it up when I see them next time, thank you I never thought of that"
aww,Amazing! I love it! Thanks so much for immortalising us :)
aww,I think you used too big of a word and got lumped in with the buzz kills.
aww,"I‚Äôve tried a few different brands, Treatibles, Canna-Pet, Holistic Hound and more recently Santa Cruz Pet Naturals. My dog likes them all, but I think has an easier time with the Treatibles and SC Pet Naturals, because they seem to have a lighter crunch. They all seem to give him more pep and movement."
aww,That is so awesome! Congrats to you all on this journey!
aww,"No, that‚Äôs just something that has been perpetuated by the ‚Äústop anthropomorphizing dogs‚Äù crowd on the internet/reddit. It‚Äôs about knowing what kind of smile and in what kind of situation your dog is in, in conjunction with other cues, that can let you know of your dog is stressed. A smile with the folds of the mouth highly compressed (commisures) with other signs, such as pulled back ears, wide eyes, and it a spatulate tongue indicate stress. An open mouth without compressed commisures with no other stress symptoms is an indicator of a happy smile. Contrary to what people say on this site, dogs have somewhat anthropomorphized themselves, learning and mimicking some human cues in order to obtain the rewards we give them. A smile, like the one pictured in this video, in the absence of other stress symptoms, is likely an autonomic response, like the nice shivery kind of feeling we get from getting scratched in the right place, or the locked positions we get in while having a good stretch."
aww,Those cute eyes... He has a person's gaze though.
aww,Nasty skin tag lol
aww,"They‚Äôre a handful! He lived in my townhouse for 3 months (but spent all day with his herd). Bottle feeding him was like having a newborn that you couldn‚Äôt even take grocery shopping. Once he was old enough to eat mainly solid food he lived full time with his herd, but we still gave him bottles during the day until he was about 8 months."
aww,"Formal academic studies? I mean there are numerous articles about sex and dogs in the bed and relationships. 

I'll tell you what I will go through  Lexisnexis and look for research papers later, for now use google to get the articles on the internet."
aww,There's one in every office.
aww,lol Yes you will do.
aww,But the WiFi reception is great...üôÇ
aww,This just made me all warm and fuzzy inside! What a lovely pup
aww,Why are we here? Just to suffer?!?
aww,I wonder if those other 2 are jealous or concerned...
aww,"Thats awesome!! My nephew has this, what specifically is the treatment and where did you go to get it? Right now he can still walk, but he is rapidly getting worse

Edit: nevermind, read further. Unfortunately my sister is ultraconservative and Christian and won't do that. It makes me so sad that she would rob him of this opportunity."

aww,She is so sweet! Very boop-able nose.
aww,"‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you, I'll try haha."
aww,He still has not reached the final lasagna point
aww,I get a huge smile too when I'm about to upchuck
aww,"Yeah we have her everything from a young age and she kinda just started not bothering with things and just eating the dry food. She‚Äôs only 1 now and didn‚Äôt know you could give them lots of different fruit and veg tbh. Gonna try a few things to give her more variance. We do chicken and fish every week or so for her and she eats a bit and leaves most of it. We also just free feed her and she‚Äôs very good and just not over eating so we‚Äôd have to get her into a breakfast and dinner routine with meat, fruit and veg."
aww,"Aww! My two boys are trained too, Axel and Draco sit, lay down, rolls over, high-5, high-10, paw (left and right), harness and leash trained and sit and wait for their food on cue.

Glad I‚Äôm not the only crazy cat person here hahaha!"
aww,Nibblonians are smart. You should ask Nibbler for help
aww,No stopping him now! He just wants to race his own race car with his dad and brother!
aww,I‚Äôm pretty sure that they didn‚Äôt intend this. :/
aww,I like him too.
aww,I dunno man I always decide to lick my countertops to ensure adequate cleanliness prior to food prep. Just to test germ levels. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt allow my cat there. Because I have to lick the countertops to test for germ levels and washing isn‚Äôt a thing.
aww,"I did watching this, so thank you and her!"
aww,Spoiler warning i guess
aww,"Rice, rice, maybe not."
aww,He's the most adorable thing I've ever laid eyes on. I wish he were mine. Apparently he has 3 other brothers 2 dapple and 1 brown like he is.... I want them all.
aww,This cat is 18 years old?
aww,I just used this photo to show my cat WHY he is on a diet.
aww,Kermit and hermin. He usually steals theirs but they got him back today
aww,This is really amazing! I was a volunteer at MDA Summer Camp for 7 years and lived with and took care of two brothers with Spinal Muscular Atrophy while I was in college as my job and seeing this made my heart swell. Wishing your son continued success with progress!
aww,He‚Äôs ready to show you all the cool stuff he found while you were gone.
aww,"My dog is 12 and I feel terrible knowing he's got to be feeling tired and sore so much :( it really does suck that dogs live such short lives, if any creatures deserve immortality it's dogs."
aww,"Hah, can't say she appreciates it though."
aww,Well done!! What fantastic progress!
aww,You‚Äôve clearly got the good spot there going by that smile! Such a beautiful girly

aww,Thank you. We are over the moon!
aww,"Awwww, hi there cutie.All these cats remind me of warrior cats.Ooo how about I name them with warrior cat names"
aww,"My life is a mess. I look at my reflection and wonder ‚Äúwhy am I here, what is my purpose? Why am I just a frog...‚Äù"
aww,Its just these kinds of dogs right here... If you see a golden retriever smiling its probably real but here you can start questioning it again...
aww,"I just noticed the wings on the dog behind you. I‚Äôm crying but only because this is so sweet. I‚Äôve seen your subreddit, and would be more than interested in a commissioned piece. Will PM you information if that‚Äôs okay OP"
aww,She is a beauty! I miss mine :(
aww,"Stop being such a condescending fuck. You're the one making the claim, you can back it up as well."
aww,"&gt;you know people who read the books are extremely dissapointed right?

And why should I give a fuck if they're disappointed."
aww,I DO NOT KNOW who put them there
aww,"I'm fairly sure that the EU has stricter regulations on meat than the US has, but I was taking the piss with the woman comment (:"
aww,My dog licks his nose frantically before doing that? Really odd.
aww,It looks like a Mottledpelt
aww,Yes you should buy this
aww,"My boy never was in pain, but he got to the point where he could no longer walk or get up.  That's when we made the decision.  I still hate myself for it, even though I know it needed to be done.  The disease basically makes them lose all feeling, so the only pain they may have comes from falling down.  Keeping them mobile definitely helps.  I hope you get to have him for as long as possible.  We adopted our boy from the pound - so we didn't get to have him as long as we hoped, but I think he had a good life with us and I miss him every single day.  We have a new boy that is a fantastic doggo, but you can never replace those you lose."
aww,"That breaks my heart. She would be against it because of where the stem cells come from? If so, you can go elsewhere and get stem cells from umbilical cords, but I'm unsure if those results are as promising"
aww,That‚Äôs awesome. Good for you!
aww,This makes me so happy üò≠
aww,Looks like a ragdoll
aww,Thank you for the response - wonderful!
aww,At first I read smells instead of smiles and thought she'd be getting a bath lol
aww,Makes me smile to see a dog that happy!
aww,"If I had to guess, this sweet baby is a rescue. You are not wrong though, it is definitely something that needs to be stopped."
aww,It really is! Thank you!
aww,The public cat school in my neighborhood is abysmal. I don't blame her exercising her right to a home kitten education.
aww,Awesome painting!! Can‚Äôt go wrong with dogs and flowers:)
aww,"Yeah, but I took the print when he was 6, because I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve been in the right space to do it around his passing. Happy Cake Day!"
aww,I love her so much omgüò≠
aww,Higher on the street.

aww,I've recently discovered the subreddit natureismetal and I expected a tiger leap onto this thing and destroy its wonderful day
aww,"What harm is there in trying? Maybe there's something we don't fully understand. Something that works in different breeds.

aww,"""I'm miserable so everyone else should be too."""

aww,"Triggered? Why are you about to cry about it... You care enough to defend literal garbage on screen. Lol you couldnt even see anything.... 

When the hardcore fans dont want to defend their show anymore that tells you something. Keep watching trendy trash"
aww,"No, this dog is not smiling in the same way we do as humans. These smiling dog videos are getting old and silly."
aww,The cats we had when I was a kid loved them. I guess it's the weird texture on them that just feels new to cats.
aww,"I‚Äôm no bird expert, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how feathers work."
aww,"My dog also puts her paw up on my arm when I scratch under her chin and neck. If I stop, she actually tries to pull my arm back with her paw. Adorable."
aww,"I really need to get a wire brush for him. I got a rubber de-shedding thing because I was worried about using the wire ones, but it doesn't work that well"
aww,"Because thats a magazine?

And i doubt you speak french"
aww,"Here's the original post from 2 years ago:

aww,Correct if I‚Äôm wrong but isn‚Äôt this good girl the one that loved being sprayed with a hose?
aww,"In my experience people with cats don't tend to clean anything properly. I mean just look at this vid. The outside of the cooker looks like it's never been cleaned in it's life, Lord."
aww,Awww honey..I'm so sorry for your loss..I will have you in my heart and prayers.
aww,That's the fancy way of spelling it.
aww,It was the hardest thing ever posting it here and giving our family an update. My fingers want to move a million miles per hour. I feel like I could just pass out because I'm overflowing with emotion

aww,"I've definitely been there twice. It isn't easy to lose a beloved pet, but it will get easier with time. Sorry for your loss."
aww,Thank you. You did the right thing. It is very tough taking care of them and I think deep down the dogs don‚Äôt want that. I work from home so I am able to give my dog more care than some others could. My dogs time is soon but I think he still has some life to live
aww,"Where is your chicken that cheap??? D': Unless I catch it on sale, the cheapest it is is 1.99/Lb near me."

aww,"They‚Äôre like the bears from We Bare Bears, except in dogs"
aww,"&gt; Precisely what I expected, you didn't even read the TITLE of that study. 

Duuuuuude. I actually did read the title, just like you, and then I continued reading, unlike you, so I know, for a fact, that incontinence is specifically one of the things they were controlling, lol. And yes, the study is about humans, you'd be surprised how much human medicine is given to dogs, biologically speaking, we are not that different.

&gt; Just picked a random one from google that seemed to agree with what Moonbeam Von Oilstein up here was parroting. 

Dude, Google it yourself, you'll see plenty more studies supporting this. You are embarrassing yourself, the difference between smart people and the alt-medicine crowd is that smart people actually look up shit and read scientific articles before jumping to conclusions. What does it tell about you?"
aww,I can assure u..the lid is not fully closed when i found her üòä
aww,"He is just mimicking what is happening on the TV.

You see his face, no understanding - only copy."

Even still.. the pupper in this video is precious, and has the biggest smile."
aww,"No, not in the way we do as humans. The ""smile"" does not mean they are necessarily happy. In this instance, it's like having and itch scratched, and the face just means they hit the spot."

aww,"Damn, that is a handsome cat even by human standards."
aww,Exactly. Comic and book ‚Äúpurists‚Äù are a plague. They complain when every little thing isn‚Äôt 100% how they remembered or think it should be. And I would bet my life that all these ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù fans will be tuning in next week.
aww,No one cares about ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù fans. The show is fun. Get over it.
aww,"the point is that you can bet that just because the shape of a dog's (or any animal) mouth resembles a human smile, the dog is absolutely not thinking or behaving the same way as a human. this is a common misconception- anthropomorphisation because of the lack of knowledge. and sometimes if you point out that a dog is not a human, the wholesomeness police comes for you."

What gets me the most is that he will have to grow into his teenage years, if he makes it that far, and grasp the concept that there is treatment available but his mother ""doesn't believe in it"" I hate that He'll have to go through that. I haven't heard of the umbilical chords but I'll look it up and let her know, maybe it could act as a gateway drug to get her to change her mind"

aww,I was feeling stressed and anxious just now and I watched this for nearly 5 straight minutes...thank you. What a good girl!
aww,"Losing a pet is very tough. It looks like she was a sweet girl, and I'm sure she loved the time she had with you."
aww,"Is it too much to think that maybe some people enjoy stuff that you don't? There's much bigger things to get worked up over than game of thrones.

Also there's not much that's more cringe-inducing that starting off with ""Triggered?"""
aww,"This dog looks exactly like my old black lab. His name was Norman. He was the best dog i've ever had. He lived to be 18 years old. We lived on a farm for 17 of those years. One of my most vivid memories of him was, one day I was walking to the barn, and saw him with just the back legs and tail of a kitten sticking out of his mouth. At first I was scared he had killed it, but he was super sweet and would never do that. I asked him what he was doing, and he just calmly walked over to the corner of the barn and spit the kitten out next to about 4 others that looked the same. He turns, and walks outside, and grabbed another and did the same. He was just putting them back where mama cat had been keeping them, but she was off somewhere else."
aww,Truly a loaf of bread just napping on the couch lmao so cute
aww,The Prophecy was Sealed!
aww,Haha. The dog wanted to be apart of the video and my son's journey
aww,‚ÄúGuess what you‚Äôre about to clean up?‚Äù
aww,"Fantastic! He's small, but deserves to be healthy - and mice are super cute.

Wash your hands after handling, especially before eating - and don't be rubbing at your eyes after handling without washing, even after he's checked and cleaned up. 

Knew a kid when I was younger who got a nasty eye infection from having ferrets - and they were well kept, but he'd rubbed his eyes after cleaning out their cage and... ya gotta remember, controlled, tiny environment with animals who, like it or not, track around some doo-doo.

Are the odds high? No. But this dude's face (Doug T, you out there?) was yuck and he was out of school for a week and it was funny but sucked for him. We thought we were funny and called him pus-y Doug because it sounded like the other thing but when challenged by teachers and stuff we'd back it up with the story and they'd concede we were being rude teasing our friend but not vulgar in our screaming/writing it all over his binders/sticking signs to his back. It was 9th grade. We were childish.

Good luck with the mouse, he's adorable."
aww,"what a beautiful, happy girl! So happy you have each other."
aww,RIP in Peace Kitty.
aww,"Damn, my condolences, man. Our 13 y/o best girl passed away in summer 2017 and I'm still not over it."

aww,I love it when she put her paw on you
aww,"G. Gorilla Jameson, from the Spider-Ham universe?"

aww,What a happy SHINY boy. He‚Äôs SO shiny. Very handsome dog. Tell him he‚Äôs handsome and shiny for me please?
aww,Them left hooks look dangerous(ly cute)
aww,You need to tell your friend to get their head out of their ass and start taking proper care of the animal they keep. This is fucked up.
aww,Or he‚Äôs just saying hello through a portal :)
aww,"Dogs smile with their tails, not their faces."
aww,"yeah the dog even looks like it's going ""uh, ok"""
aww,My dog made this face right before she took a dump on my couch..
aww,Maybe one with a new puppy to stea...adopt.
aww,The kindness quickly goes out of the window when they find out you don‚Äôt have any treats left!
aww,Actually : wouaf-wouaf! And I swear we are the only one hearing them right haha
aww,She‚Äôs doing some massive calculations.
aww,Can we please stop the constant cat posts? They're awful animals.
aww,"Oh hai, close plz."
aww,Is that not normal? My cat LOVES plastic bags and paper because of the sounds. There's also cat toys that mimic the sounds.
aww,"As with ANYTHING, a medical professional, in this case the dog‚Äôs veterinarian, should be consulted before trying ANY medicine or remedy that‚Äôs not prescribed. Just because something can work for and/or is safe for humans does not mean that is will work or is okay for animals."
aww,Becaise it‚Äôs a sign that dog is uncomfortable
aww,He does have the best snoot. Could you boop it gently from this internet stranger too. Thanks.

aww,You really suck at understanding things don‚Äôt you?
aww,And I'm obsessed with your cat now
aww,"Aw that‚Äôs so sweet! 
Axel is 5 and Draco is 3. 
I also meant to add axel lays on my lap on his back and purrs while getting his nails trimmed, shows his teeth when asked, likes his teeth brushed and sits on the scales on cue.
 Both boys are target trained (my vet loves the boys cause of how well behaved they are, the girls are assholes and Helena isn‚Äôt all there in the head so she has a excuse for her behaviour and teddy is feral and I tamed her to trust us so she‚Äôs also excused). The girls both sit though and come when called üòÇ
Training is amazing, super stimulating and fun for both them and us when done right. It‚Äôs so rewarding, you get so many bonus like being able to show people cats aren‚Äôt stupid, well behaved animals"
aww,Of course I do.
aww,Aww I hope my Cody reminded you of yours
aww,"My first thought as well.

However this is most likely the farmer just being funny."
aww,Is that path in Surrey because I swear I've seen it before?
aww,What I personally find difficult to understand is how there's apparently an endless influx of pits with cropped ears in these shelters. It tells me there's something wrong further up the chain and not enough is being done about it.
aww,Can you link some studies? I've always been interested in why dogs smile like this.
aww,"Lol negative review of a show means i want to watch the world burn. How sensitive and protective can you be over such a shit show lol..  Its objectively bad and i dont hesitate to say it.

Keep enjoying corny smug one liners, plot holes, teleportation, plot armor."
aww,They don't though. You are ignorant.
aww,"""dude google it yourself, you'll see plenty more studies supporting this""  


You're the one trying to push essential oils, burden of proof is on you, and so far you're failed spectacularly."
aww,"Whether they get their tail cut off or not you know lambs are bred so they're killed at 4 months old for lamb chops, right? Why does cutting their tail off beforehand bother you?"
aww,I can't stop watching this. It's kind of hypnotizing.
aww,I love that guilty face üòÅ
aww,Is it me or does she look like Brienne from GoT after she got knighted
aww,He's a pup again! How cute! How sweet!!
aww,Her main job is being cute and that's a 24/7 responsibility.
aww,Absolutely. Maybe show her the video of my son as well. Maybe she can put her beliefs aside? I will pray that he gets to experience the same thing my son currently is
aww,"Seeing a dog that appears to be in incredible pain doesn't elicit an ""awww :)"" from me but an ""awww shit poor boy :("""
aww,No - we no see your cat!

aww,Such a pretty pittie!
aww,"Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle, yeah
Do the wiggle, man."
aww,"It's been four days, if you cared that much then you would have seen it by now."
aww,Your rice is ready meow
aww,You can check my new pic. Her ears got even bigger hahahaha
aww,Holy cat she looks shoft.
aww,"Old cats always look like they're tired of living, lol. Like they have had enough of this shit."
aww,"It's been 5 days, whoever cares about the show has either watched it or is so busy that he can't even read this."
aww,You can try dog-walking or even dog-sitting. Chances are there are people living around you who may need a bit of help with their dpgs and are willing to pay for it.
aww,Interesting. Thanks so much for taking the time to answer. Wishing your son and family the very best luck moving forward!
aww,I legit laughed out loud at this comment. Have the first gold i've ever purchased!

aww,Pit bull smiles are one of my absolute favorite things in the world!
aww,"Thank you. 

She was the sweetest girl, and I hope she somehow knew how much she meant to us."
aww,Small fluffy white elephant
aww,It gets pretty annoying how people humanize dogs so much. Dogs are great and intelligent animals but some people feel like if they don‚Äôt act enough like humans then they‚Äôre not interesting. Your dog doesn‚Äôt need to ‚Äúsmile‚Äù to be happy.
aww,"He/she looks like one of the yeti's from that one The mummy sequel with the dragon emperor. Someone must know what I'm talking about, if you don't please search it. It's worth the time."
aww,Bunch of crusty people in this thread who can't accept that staged videos of a dog with two eggs is still cute.

aww,"The many rehabbers I've talked to recommend getting the bird to the rehabber ASAP to be treated with anti-inflammatories and other medication, and examined for other injuries. If you're a smaller rehabber that doesn't have the space/time to treat birds, just say that. We have a larger rehab center near Cleveland that has taken in up to a couple hundred birds in a day that hit windows in downtown Cleveland. They worked all day to treat the birds that needed treatment, release the ones that recovered, etc. But many birds don't end up surviving or need to be euthanized due to injuries. So I wouldn't recommend telling the public to just let the birds sleep it off just because you don't have the space."

He passed away shortly before my husband and I found out I was pregnant with our daughter. We like to think he felt it was okay to go because we had a baby coming and wouldn‚Äôt be alone. Probably silly, but it helped us cope. Spoil your Cody for us üòä"
aww,look at him go! keep it up big guy.
aww,Your autism is off the charts
aww,Now if my Frenchie was laying like that his snore/snort would be going strong. How about this guy?
aww,Took me a minute to find the actual cat
aww,The actual cooking vessel isn‚Äôt in it in the video; it‚Äôs the same level of gross as a cat walking across a hot plate or stovetop.
aww,That cloud is shaped like a dog!
aww,"He will continue to improve, but we also have the option to go back and get more Injections, which we would love to do someday. Now that he's up and able to walk, we will work our asses off every day to work those leg muscles and keep building them up"
aww,"Oi m8, you got a loicense for that celebrating?"
aww,This literally made me ‚ÄúAwww‚Äù out loud
aww,"Fucking awesome! Go, man, go!"
aww,Okay. I read about it. I didn't know it was a common practice. Maybe  keeping pets isn't as simple as I thought.
aww,Perfectly cooked rice ...WITH TEETH!!
aww,Your excitement excites me
aww,I wanna kiss her!!! Kiss her for me üòò üòò üòò
aww,aw man I dropped to ball on this one. I'll update my post with some pictures!
aww,My dog only drinks fresh rain water. He stopped drinking from a bowl about a year ago. We now need to keep a bucket outside and keep it filled up either with rain water or from the hose

aww,"downvotes arent warranted if OP is ignorant cmon now.

Pitbulls are a type of dog that can be male or female."
aww,So energetic!  They're like fluffy little racehorses!
aww,"I'm having trouble telling if that is a very big dog or a very small one.

Edit - I'm guessing small?"
aww,"Embryonic/fetal stem cells are not mature enough to transform into therapeutically relevant cells in many cases. The best, most robust pluripotent stem cells are made from skin fibroblasts. My company is generating these from adult donors and we can manufacture new cells quickly. The FDA is reviewing a large number of clinical trials for use of such technology now. It‚Äôs growing in the US at a rapid pace! Just hang in there, more help is in the way."
aww,Not trash pandas there there bandit pandas
aww,Ours does the same. He likes a variety of fruit.

aww,Yup seems like it. Unless its an alien from mars attacks.
aww,You‚Äôre being downvoted because of your whining. Not because of some conspiracy to hide the fact that the show isn‚Äôt the same as it used to be. Go back to r/asoiaf.
aww,A pack of rats. Like in the secret of NIMH
aww,Just my thoughts exactly.
aww,"It's less a happy smile and more of a satisfaction face from scratching a good spot. Staffies and Pits just look like they're smiling cause of their head shape, my Shepherd just gets a really long face."
aww,"Here is a recipe from a vet (more than just chicken and taurine is needed for a balanced diet): https://catinfo.org/making-cat-food/

I've been using this recipe for two years and my cats are incredibly healthy and energetic.

Edited to add that it is a recipe by a vet. Not just some random person on the internet."
aww,YOU COOKED YOUR CAT? /s
aww,"Or they have family/friends that are long distance that they're waiting to watch it with, or any other number of reasons because different people have different lives and priorities. It takes very little energy to just not be an asshole, ya know."

aww,Oh that‚Äôs gonna leave a mark.
aww,Aww! What breed is she? She looks like a pit. If she is i love her even more! Pit Bulls are the best!
aww,"Try this https://catinfo.org/making-cat-food/

Very detailed.

Edited to add I've used this recipe for 2 years with great success.  Also, I just use raw chicken and don't partial bake like she does. 

Finally, be sure to switch your cats over to raw gradually. Mix 1/8 raw with 7/8 canned for a week. Then go to 1/4 raw to 3/4 canned for week, etc. Their stomach pH has to adapt as well as their palates."
aww,fuck whoever did that to her ears
aww,"What a very good boy. Cherish that man, you won't be able to when he's gone."
aww,"Aaaaaaaand that's gonna wrap up our 1,000,000 reasons I hate snakes show."

aww,"Wow, someone pet the dog! Yay!"
aww,"Actually I think he's the one trying to push being as well informed as you can be, you're just being a reactionary. But, I don't suppose this message will change your opinion on that either so good luck, have fun!"
aww,Everytime I watch this I'm always expecting the deer to fall through the floor because of the edited version of this gif. For anyone interested [here](https://gfycat.com/QuerulousOptimalDrafthorse) is the edited version.
aww,"You could volunteer on weekends at a local shelter, they always need extra hands and you could get both dog and cat snuggles.  :)"

aww,I‚Äôve never seen or heard anyone use the word facetious except my grandma thank you for the smile
aww,Ah I see.. Well they do love cool and dark hiding spots. I would be more careful from now on if I were you :)
aww,Data? Is that you?
aww,"Once again, who the hell, other than you, has mentioned essential oils? I am not pushing anything, least of all any essential oil nonsense. I am talking about a specific substance, that happens to be an oil, as in, a viscous organic liquid, but how the hell does that even matter? This is, by the way, the first time I have ever heard about any connection between pumpkin oil and incontinence, the only difference between you and me is that I looked it up and found evidence in its favour while you made an arrogant assumption that it must not work because it has ""oil"" in name, lmao.

I gave you one paper that proves that pumpkin oil is a viable medicine against urinary ailments. That is enough to prove it is not some alternative medicine. You are willfully ignorant. That's what we call people who refuse to do even cursory research."
aww,"There's plenty of evidence to suggest that [dogs adopt the emotions and expressions](https://www.seeker.com/dogs-catch-emotions-from-people-1770642259.html) of their owners. If the person doing the scratching in the video is smiling and happy, the dog could very well be doing it for the same reason."

aww,"Well, sure, they look like they're smiling when they pant."
aww,just smile for me now
aww,I spend close to 500 a month on food alone
aww,"She is adorable :) and the way she holds on to the fork, it's too much :)"
aww,"I remember studying stem cells in 8th grade as part of a science project. I was interested in it's potential to heal and was scoffed at because of how the stem cells were being acquired(fetus extraction) 
This was back in 2004 and we have come a long ways since then with new more advance methods and this to me is absolutely beautiful.

Bless you and keep moving forward!!"
aww,That just made me so happy.
aww,Who‚Äôs doing that lol?
aww,"Sure it's cute now, but wait til he's 34, got a drink in hand and access to throwable fixtures."
aww,Thanks! I will look into it!
aww,Hey Charlie! How's your day going?
aww,Tell him he is a pretty cat.
aww,"The open mouth ""smile"" is definitely reminding me of my corgi."
aww,"i think /r/jcamp33 made a general statement and didn't just blindly accuse whoever is petting her in the video. i agree though, fuck whoever did those ears."
aww,"UK or US? The only person I am aware of who was doing this was a man in California who isn't registered as a breeder and was crossing his NI dog with something else, claiming they were Tamaskans."
aww,"With boingy splat sound

aww,"TIL: Baby alpaccas are called ""Chicks"""
aww,Can it even breath with that face? That's just a sad.
aww,"As the last comment to you said - your cats pickiness is irrelevant - stop providing the dry food and provide what you want. She can ignore it if she wants but she will get hungry and eat it eventually (no cat will hurt themselves on a hunger strike) and then that will be her new normal.

She‚Äôs only picky and leaves food because you‚Äôve made it normal to clean it up and feed her something else - if she escaped the house she wouldn‚Äôt just die if she isn‚Äôt declawed - she‚Äôd survive off of small mammals."
aww,"Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,
right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and that
thief over there."
aww,how DARE you interrupt my class
aww,"Exactly, the tail can be argued for since many pits get ‚Äúhappy tail‚Äù they wag so hard it bleeds than blood flys all over the walls, but there is no reason for the ears"
aww,That made my day! Love seeing the old timers zoomies!
aww,The shoftest shorthair ever! Nothing could be better to pet.
aww,That escalated quickly haha
aww,"Please try to learn from this:

1. The bird is not suddenly calm/tame. It is suffering from brain trauma and is in a state of shock. You are still a predator in its eyes, but it is confused and doesn't know what to do. Do not pet it, do not let it see you, as you will only increase its stress level. Birds can die just from the stress alone, even if this one didn't.
2. The fact that it later flies away is no indication that it survived. It only indicates that the bird regained its senses enough to once again see you as a predator, and try to escape. The brain swelling and trauma are still untreated, and it may still die later of its injuries.
3. If you've made it this far without shutting down, then you really do care about wildlife. Congratulations! In the future, the only proper thing to do is put the bird in a small box or paper bag, without any food or water, and keep it in a warm quiet spot until you can get it to a wildlife rehabilitator, ideally ASAP.  You may have to drive quite a way to get to the nearest rehabber. Most people aren't willing to do that. So don't be like most people - take the time out of your day to drive it to the rehabber, or see if they can send someone to pick it up, or meet you halfway.
4. If there are no rehabbers or avian vets anywhere near you, then keep it in the bag or box for at least an hour or two. Release it near the woods (or near water, depending on the species) and hope for the best.

Experience: Volunteer with Lights Out Cleveland, spending my weekends in the spring and fall rescuing hundreds of birds that hit windows all over downtown Cleveland. About half the birds survive the initial impact, and a fraction of the survivors are successfully rehabilitated and released."
aww,What?! Next you‚Äôre going to tell me that grumpy cat isn‚Äôt really grumpy.
aww,I want to hug that dog so badly.
aww,He is so cute! I don't care if it is staged!
aww,Thread locks before the jaw does
aww,Looks like May weather doing the shoulder roll.
aww,What kind of cat? I want a cat that is trainable like that. Are they Orientals? It would be nice if they were since I'm allergic to cats and they are supposed to be hypo for most cat allergies.
aww,OMG I love chonky wrinkles
aww,Omg he is so mushy and cute ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÇ
aww,"PLEASE POST AGAIN!! Also, it looks like he has a lot of life left in him!! We got my 11 year old lab a rescue lab about a year old, and it kept her going for years after. Her overall health and mobility improved to such an amazing degree!  It even improved her incontinence that she began struggling with pretty early on when she was 7 or 8 (not completely, but it still improved). Maybe your Aunt can get him another dog to keep him young! &lt;3"
aww,Deffo a Pok√©mon...js bro

aww,This is why you need to dry your dogs! Don‚Äôt let em wrinkle from air drying
aww,"Damn. This hits right in the feels OP. Our 13 year old lab had to be put down last year. We got her when I was 5 so she'd been with me for most of my life! 

I would move back in an inkstand or puppynap the dog!"
aww,Ay congratulations it‚Äôs a celebration
aww,Our GSD does too. We call it the vomit smile.
aww,Must a super inefficient way to move
aww,"I couldn't leave without him, why would you? üò•"
aww,"He looks just like my old lab! Her name was thunder and she gave us 15 amazing years. That girl was always ready to play, no matter how old and tired she was. Good dog."
aww,"Conspiracy theory? What are you talking about...  And is this what you guys do? Puff out your intellectual chest and tell me to ""go back to my subs"" lol pretty pathetic, you must wield little power in the real world."
aww,We should do something to get it removed from breed standards. Let's start harassing the show dog organizations.

aww,"Please try to learn some lessons from the well-intentioned mistakes made here:

1. The bird is not suddenly tame/calm just because it hit a window. It is suffering from brain trauma and is in a state of shock, as you would be after a serious car accident. You are still a predator in its eyes, but it is confused and doesn't know what to do. Do not pet it, do not let it see you, as you will only increase its stress level. Animals hide their stress to avoid appearing weak to predators and rivals. Birds can die just from the stress of being handled, even if this one didn't.
2. The fact that it later flies away is no indication that it survived. It only indicates that the bird regained its senses enough to once again see you as a predator, and try to escape. The brain swelling and trauma are still untreated, and it may still die later of its injuries.

aww,"But when you think about it, blood can't fly on the wall if he is not in the house. Nowdays way too many people get dog but they don't have infracusture (land, big garden, etc) to have him. Dogs are dogs. They like most being dogs. People forget that. 50% of dogs today are ""babies"". But they are dogs. And dog is an animal. If you can't let him be dog why get him in the first place."

People like the rude poster above that prefer pharmaceuticals will be given Phenylpropanolamine or something along those lines by their vet, and so their dogs will be on an amphetamine derivative, this will work for the incontinence also, but of course have undesirable side effects.

aww,"So a lot of people are going to say no, because dogs don't display their emotions in ways that are directly analogous to human emotions. For instance, pulling back the corners of the mouth is *often* a sign of stress in a dog rather than a ""smile"". However, in this case i think the dog is just reacting to some really good neck scritches. My dog makes a similar face when we scratch under her collar, usually accompanied by scratching the air with her own leg the way they often do for really good scritches in a place they can't reach. My wife and I call this smile her ""muppet face"" because she resembles Kermit the frog, and I'm 100% sure that in my dog's case it's a sign of enjoyment of top quality scritches. I would guess that the dog in this gif is experiencing a similar emotion."

People are going to get abortions, whether I(and other pro-birth or pro-life'rs) want them to or not, so why not make the best of a bad situation.

aww,"Superman tat? Looks pretty sick. Also, cute cat haha"
aww,"It depends on the age of your cats and the type of cat, whether she's an indoor cat who lays around or a very active one or an outdoor cat who hunts on his own.  General rule of thumb, feed adult cats, either in raw food or canned food, is to feed 2 to 4% of the cat's ideal body weight per day. For an inactive and/or older cat the 2% amount might be good and for a very active and/or younger cat, 4% might be closer to what's needed. If it's an outdoor cat they usually let you know when they're hungry and I feed them several small meals throughout the day. I never feed them just once, usually at least three times. I leave dry food all the time for my cat, allow them indoors and out pretty much at will (and I have had cats live to be 25, so...) and feed the better stuff as ""meals"" throughout the day. Outdoor cats are different than indoor cats, though - indoor cats tend to eat more through boredom so I guess you might just do the same, (small portions of raw throughout the day) but without the dry food. 

Thing is, you can't cook ahead, but you can freeze the food, so long as you remember to take it out to thaw - nothing like a kitty begging when there's nothing you can do about it (maybe run the microwave? ::shrug::) or worse - chipped teeth on frozen turkey. 

There are dangers associated with raw diets for cats (just like with us). It's especially important that your cat not be exposed to bacteria that would be pasteurized from her food normally if she has feline leukemia or is on steroids (lowering immunity) or has certain other health conditions, especially those affecting the immune system. 

Biggest health benefit is reduction of starch and increase of taurine, (they need about 125mg on avg. found in muscle and heart meats). You can choose prepackaged raw cat foods to help with portioning. Avoid foods with synthetic vitamins added. A toxicity occurs when high doses of \[synthetic\] vitamins are taken over a prolonged period of time. If diets are not balanced properly, there can be deficiencies and if food is not handled properly, there can be food borne illnesses like salmonella.

 A balanced raw diet should include flesh, organs, a bone or ground bone and a small amount of vegetation. ... You can also choose a commercially prepared *raw cat* food. These are available at many pet stores and come with a certification from *the* Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). 

Ground turkey and a variety of meats is recommended, to prevent a deficiency or excess and repeat it happening if it occurs. Fish can be included for omega 3 and sardines are a good option since they carry a lower concentration of heavy metals. Liver and muscles like heart should be included as well as bones such as quail bones, although they should be supervised when eating the bones (the bones clean teeth and may aid in digestion, but are a possible choking hazard - some bones are more apt to splintering than others)."
aww,Can you point out anyone actually doing it though? Because I‚Äôve literally never seen anyone give excuses.
aww,Lol that look behind the shoulder
aww,She is Ourya comrade.
aww," Please try to learn some lessons from the well-intentioned mistakes made here:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The bird is not suddenly tame/calm just because it hit      a window. It is suffering from brain trauma and is in a state of shock, as      you would be after a serious car accident. You are still a predator in its      eyes, but it is confused and doesn't know what to do. Do not pet it, do      not let it see you, as you will only increase its stress level. Animals      hide their stress to avoid appearing weak to predators and rivals. Birds      can die just from the stress of being handled, even if this one didn't.
2. The fact that it later flies away is no indication that      it survived. It only indicates that the bird regained its senses enough to      once again see you as a predator, and try to escape. The brain swelling      and trauma are still untreated, and it may still die later of its injuries.
3. If you've made it this far without shutting down, then      you really do care about wildlife. Congratulations! In the future, the      only proper thing to do is put the bird in a small box or paper bag,      without any food or water, and keep it in a warm quiet spot until you can      get it to a wildlife rehabilitator, ideally ASAP. You may have to drive      quite a way to get to the nearest rehabber. Most people aren't willing to      do that. So don't be like most people - take the time out of your day to      drive it to the rehabber, or see if they can send someone to pick it up,      or meet you halfway.
4. If there are no rehabbers or avian vets anywhere near      you, then keep it in the bag or box for at least an hour or two. Release      it near the woods (or near water, depending on the species) and hope for      the best.

Experience: Volunteer with Lights Out Cleveland, spending my weekends in the spring and fall rescuing hundreds of birds that hit windows all over downtown Cleveland. About half the birds survive the initial impact, and a fraction of the survivors are successfully rehabilitated and released. This isn't a ""once in a lifetime"" moment for me."

aww,"Im a buzzkill I know... But my wife who works at a vet has me conditioned, and I cant get past how bad (though cute) that is for the doggo."
aww,Your AirWick isn‚Äôt going to work right turned sideways like that.
aww,paw ink to paper n let it dry
aww,Did you seriously steal someone else's picture for karma?  Pretty trashy
aww,Large increase in hair quotient.
aww,Arthur is a Chausie Cat(Abyssinian/jungle cat)-he is very trainable but will get much bigger(he is 20lbs already but should reach close to 30)-as a Hybrid they are supposed to produce less of the protein in their saliva that causes allergies.
aww,"I have a kitten (Eve) who was abandoned by her mother in my backyard at 6 weeks old. My Shepherd mix (who found her) decided it was his duty to father her. She spent the next several weeks solely around our dogs and us before deciding to spend a bunch of her time up in the loft with our other cat Yoshimi, where Eve attempted to learn how to be a cat. Since Yoshimi only tolerates her, she makes no effort to teach Eve, so Eve just imitates her. So Eve does a bunch of cat things, but completely wrong because she doesn't know the purpose of the actions."
aww,Earlier today I saw a video on my Twitter timeline of a penguin laying an egg. It was not terribly different than this video. Both times I was equally as uncomfortable.
aww,That's a heckin penguin.
aww,Did it want to talk to you about free real estate?
aww,this makes me so so happy
aww,Ok so two weeks is the limit?  So endgame spoilers are ok in a week
aww,She actually spent about 10-15 minutes hopping around my yard before cautiously approaching her nest. She was being really careful that no predators were around before she had her babies come out. Everytime she feeds them she's like this - very aware of her surroundings! Once she's done feeding them and they are back in the nest she hops off and isn't stressed looking at all. The feedings only last a few minutes and just twice a day.
aww,"Looks like you're mad, bro.  How about you take us through how medicines are made,  I was unaware you were an organic chemist.  Enlighten us with your ways, moonbeam.

Dude quoted a study on humans, where the actual abstract says the results look promising, but are inconclusive, and that must magically apply to all animals, right?  People are even downvoting the person in here saying you should ask your vet before using homeopathic remedys on your animals.    


The oil cult is real."
aww,"After the third level, he just got pissed."
aww,Man this dog is moving like he has bad joints. Do they make pain pills for dogs to help them go on walks?
aww,But that doesn't make people who talk about what happened in those episodes assholes. There's been enough time where the spoiler alert for the first three episodes is up.
aww,Ramses...is the number 1
aww,He doesn‚Äôt need that! Just some wet food.
aww,"I do know that, because the way the dog reacts to that specific spot being scratched, and the way they pull their muscles (hence the ""smile"") to signify that that is, indeed, the spot. What I'm saying is that this smile doesn't mean happiness in the same way ascribe to human smile."
aww,the person it was stolen from probably does.
aww,I think some people seeing this don't know dog terms
aww,Thank you for this super insightful comment and being a beacon of intelligence amongst this comment section of people finding something cute. You‚Äôre really doing God‚Äôs work.
aww,Why werent you invited to that dinner?ü§î
aww,You got a direwolf! Congratulations!
aww,You are great. Thank you!
aww,I'm uncertain how location injections and systemic injections would deliver stem cells to his muscles. Also did he receive high dose steroids or other immunosuppression? I'm not finding much literature outside of bone marrow transplants or local injections to specific muscle groups to transfer nuclei to the area. Do you have more information? I'm an adult doctor not a pediatrician but I've taken care of an older (late 20s) gentleman numerous times with DMD in the hospital.
aww,Everything about this is so British. I love it. Labs are truly one of the greatest dog breeds on earth.
aww,"Sorry for you loss. I just transferred his paw to paper with non toxic ink one night while he was basically sleeping in his bed, washed his paw, and filed it away. I went to a place in Boulder, CO on a whim one day, talked to a dude, came back a few days later and he put it on me.

aww,Dogs don‚Äôt need no blankets just a warm body to sleep next to
aww,"Oh lovely kitten.
You looks so cute"
aww,I‚Äôm not fuckin crying... you... you are!
aww,SHES HUMAN TO ME DAMMIT!
aww,It appears by her outfit and makeup that it happened the same day. Damn they do grow fast.
aww,"Oh ok sorry, just that I've known ppl who don't allow their dogs on couches or carpets or car's. Cuz of the hair."
aww,"Or you‚Äôre just an idiot for assuming that I‚Äôm buying this woman‚Äôs urine. 

I heard about the whole thing in a documentary that covered strange aspects of sexuality in various cultures.

But my all means, keep making a fool of yourself here."
aww,Umm... that dog is being a little rough with those rabbits. Looks more like she thinks they're toys than puppies.
aww,If only futurama has this happy of an ending
aww,The dog changes and grows and yet human doesn't change including clothes
aww,"Mine isn't, but I love to see dogs smile"
aww,Those kittens are definitely more than a couple days old
aww,Is there a r/frompuppytodog for cats??
aww,It makes a change from chicken in a basket
aww,The question with any medication is do the benefits outweigh the negatives. In this case does the normal pill work better than pumpkin seed. You'd have to ask a vet.
aww,I second this! I work in the veterinary field and foster mostly older dogs with health issues that no one wants to adopt. CBD has made a lot of their last years a little less painful. It works differently case to case but some report their old dogs playing around like they were puppies again (:
aww,"Your first edit is dead on, I'll admit. If one rewatches the first 4 seasons and then the next 4, just... they are completely different shows.

The first 4 seasons still had some wholesome moments though, so your initial comment is kinda bs."
aww,"Oof, funny you should mention that...

They have another dog that they bring to visit our campus and my boyfriend always gets so excited to see the pup, only to have the babe run past him and right to me instead. Every time it happens a little more light dies from his eyes üò≠"

aww,"If there are no dogs in heaven, then when I die I want to go where they went"
aww,"He's probably been fat for a long time. You can still treat your dog without overfeeding him. Odds are his quality of life would be much better if he wasn't obese. And he might live longer, at that."
aww,Go get another there‚Äôs plenty who need homes and you have a Lotta room in your heart
aww,I personally think so RE: Endgame. TV shows are different since they're in quick succession of one another. TV episodes spoiler alerts should only last a couple days.
aww,"My dog definitely mimics certain observed human behaviours. She frequently gestures and points with her nose at things she wants me to pay attention to. 

My last dog used to pat his paw on the couch to get people to come sit with him. I had been using the same motion to tell him it was okay to hop on for a sit on the sofa. 

Dogs obviously don't have language, but they absolutely communicate with each other. Given that dogs tend to rely on humans for their basic needs like access to food and water and physical/mental stimulation, and that we train dogs to understand our communication through simple, repeated actions, it's no surprise that some dogs attempt to find ways to communicate back."
aww,Doesn't look a day over 6. What's his secret?
aww,I have no idea how it all works either. He has been on steroids since he got diagnosed that are wreaking absolute havoc on his body. Stemcellofamerica.com may have helpful information
aww,"So awesome, great job dude! And we like that shirt! Are you guys race fans?

A member of our race team's significant other was recently diagnosed with Myotonic Muscular Dystrophy...to see how stem cell therapy has been working is giving us all a LOT of hope! Have you guys been looking into CRISPR at all?

Let me know where we can send some stickers and a team shirt!"
aww,The cat just likes the bumps on his tongue
aww,Damn that made me laugh
aww,"Meh, could still mark it. Especially in threads that aren't dedicated to the episodes. I'm not saying that he's an asshole, but if someone's not expecting to see spoilers in (whatever sub this is, I forget), they could just mark it."
aww,That's not what this looks like
aww,I‚Äôm both human and the dog
aww,Nothing nothing as good as the golden
aww,Reminds me of this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNl9ksUI-bU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNl9ksUI-bU)
aww,How are you going to complain about Pitbulls when your reddit picture is of a French Bulldog? A dog that literally lives in pain due to terrible breeding.
aww,"Many experts believe that **dogs** have learned to **smile** because they've seen humans **do the** same or because we reward them for doing so, Stilwell said. ... Woodard said **the** doggy **smile is** also known as a submissive grin, or a sign that **your dog** wants to appease you."
aww,That's the villain in the new all bird adaptation of golden eye.
aww,Objectively. I don‚Äôt think you know what that word means.
aww,Well 37 people agree with me and you don't. I wont search trough subreddit that I usually don't look unless post hits frontpage. Why would I lie about it? What is my gain there?
aww,My cat is allergic to chicken....
aww,Give him a head scratch from me. He‚Äôs a cute boy.
aww,Lots of cuddles with my wife and biscuits.
aww,He looks like Joey Diaz
aww,Like if your dog gets this attached to you this much then it should be illegal to not keep him or her.
aww,Why is cat food so expansive in the US? The cheapest cat food in my super market here in Germany is 0.30‚Ç¨ per pound.
aww,"He is OBSESSED with racing. His dad and brother currently race wingless Sprint cars on dirt tracks up here in NH. The kid eats, breathes and sleeps anything racing. Our local track allowed him to take some laps (by himself) last year after the community came together to donate parts to build him a 4 cylinder car. Is it ok if I PM you our address?"
aww,I can't stop watching it.
aww,Well that‚Äôs not actually true. You did a bunch of griping too. 75% of aww is anthropomorphizing animal faces. But for some reason everyone in this thread is in a snit about the killer pitbill that isn‚Äôt even really smiling.
aww,"Yeah, that's pretty much my line of thinking too, Reddit is, a content SHARING site, so complaining about someone sharing something they found without anything else there doesn't make sense to me, but when you see the same post 5 times in a week, it's pretty tiring, then there's people who claim content as their own, and they can burn in hell"
aww,I feel like she should have a pink bow on one of her ears... like hello kitty.
aww,The kitten looks like it feels the same about you
aww,"That's because he's making a new ""hopper"" rocket that can only ""hop"" from place to place in a suborbital trajectory without getting into orbit."
aww,"""Excuse me, did you pay for this lesson? A unipurrrsity education isn't free, move along."""
aww,"Personally, I know my house smells of my dogs and I couldn‚Äôt care less about it. I‚Äôm admittedly nose blind to it, but it‚Äôs not a ‚Äústink‚Äù to me, either. This is their home just likes it‚Äôs mine. I also have a very large backyard for them to run around and be dogs in, as you said. 

I think I agree with your overall intention in suggesting that all dogs should get exercise."
aww,We're going to in time. Your comment is very true.
aww,Im not crying your crying
aww,What are they like? They aren't the ones that get upset when you go to work are they? How much do they usually cost? I'm fine with a big cat.
aww,A little uncalled for but okay.
aww,"""this is the way we wash our hands, wash our hands, wash our hands""

30secs later...I'm a 32 yr old man, why am I singing this and bobbing my head"
aww,Oh golly gee! 2 meals for the price of one!
aww,I think it's in one of those adoption windows at PetSmart or something similar.
aww,"Huh, now I know where the chairs that came with my flat come from."
aww,My kitty suckles her blankies while making cookies
aww,I wish all people could/would love their doggo this way. Mine are family to me. I now have a new idea for a great tattoo......thank you.
aww,"Once again, you clearly do not understand the difference between objective and subjective. 

See: dictionary"
aww,"Doing gods work honestly, 5 posts everyday with dogs ""smiling"""
aww,That is just so adorable and it made my day :)
aww,"When I first read this, I thought it said Bi-Polar Bear."
aww,Omg you can't be serious.
aww,But taste it three times! What a bargain!
aww,My neighbor has an outside only dog. Poor old guy is so lonely he walks over to my house almost every day just to sit on the porch with my dog. Very sad when my dog comes in for the night and the neighbor's dog is outside alone barking all night.
aww,He's flirtin with you;)
aww,"If anyone is wondering, the owner clarified on Instagram a few year(s) back that she knocks on the surface so her cat can feel the vibrations and know she's there."
aww,He deserve heckin boop
aww,No. I‚Äôm quoting Lockhart.
aww,This was oddly satisfying.
aww,"Bit of a weird question, but where did you get your dog from? Like what city?"
aww,Pretty decent glue though
aww,That is so awesome!! Way to go! I love how happy he is too. Best of luck!
aww,"Okay but if he does it , and at this rate I feel like he will ,you have to post it ."
aww,I cried.  Again.  ‚ô•Ô∏è
aww,The dog is a paid actor.
aww,"Honey, this rice has a certain *je ne sais quoi.*"
aww,"Me watching this:

0:00 *Wow that thing is huge.* üòÆ

0:30 *Aw, cute bear likes his human* üòÑ

1:31 *Jesus fuck! Oh shit! Run! ...I need a clean pair of underwear.* üò∂"
aww,"Oh my god, he is so adorable!!"
aww,Ooohhhhh I am tearing up in my dining hall-I‚Äôm in college too....I miss my pups
aww,What breed is he? Such a handsome boyüòç
aww,"Oh, my heart. &lt;3 

maybe crosspost to r/zoomies :)"
aww,"Ok but I think bringing upvotes in to the question isn‚Äôt really a good way to prove your point at all. It‚Äôs been so well documented that if a comment/post gets a few upvotes it‚Äôs likely that people will just continue to upvote for the sake of it. So I don‚Äôt really think it can be used to bolster your position. 

And I‚Äôm saying it because it literally just doesn‚Äôt happen. Unless it‚Äôs just down at the bottom of a thread in a comment that like 2 people will read. Even then I don‚Äôt see it. The only thing I ever see for cropped ears/tails are that the person rescued the dog and the previous owners did it. Or that they legitimately had to do it because of a medical condition with the dog. 

Is that what you‚Äôre talking about? Because if so, why even make the comment? What‚Äôs wrong with that."
aww,Rufio: *purrs aggressively for a solid hour*
aww,"He isn't trying to play it off as his own, the tittle is just describing the gif and he didn't make a single comment claiming it's oc."
aww,No she takes her favorite. It‚Äôs the one I have for my Avatar. You might find this interesting: for her 16th birthday she wanted a yorkie. I wanted to get another dog too because our other dog (a westie) was getting old and I thought a new dog would rejuvenate the old one. The yorkie essentially became mine because she and I just bonded. The old dog eventually passed away and for my birthday two years ago I wanted another westie. So we got one. Now that‚Äôs the dog that‚Äôs becoming my daughter‚Äôs dog. My daughter is absolutely attached to that dog.
aww,How can you be talking about sensitivity when you were the one who came in crying about this? Grow up.
aww,"My pitbull also smiles when I scratch his belly while hes sitting.. Paw on my arm hinting me to ""go lower, go lower""üòÇ"
aww,What's a tiger doing running loose in teh snow?
aww,"Whoever is cutting onions needs to stop

Really though, I'm so happy for you and your son!"
aww,It was in episode 2 BTW
aww,I just want to go along for the walk!
aww,You mean puuuurfect rice
aww,"I love when you can tell a dog is just going ""oh boy oh boy oh boy!"""
aww,I just think it's highly unlikely that if a person let's their cat get inside a rice cooker on a counter that they are keeping the cat off the counter or out of close proximity to food prep.
aww,Humans are worse yet here you are.
aww,"oWneR cOoks cAt ALiVe

aww,Shit in your hat bud. Boo hoo the Internet is mean. Get over it
aww,"Wow, that cat should have its own cats...and a beanie baby collection and a direct line to the homeowners association."
aww,"Awwwwww my heart hurts, he's so cute"
aww,"Step 1: Cook it

Step 2: Serve"
aww,"That's why it should be made so that spoilers are allowed, and everyone should just spam all kinds of theories and spoilers all over reddit even if they haven't seen the episode yet. That way it doesn't matter if you see a spoiler because you have no way of knowing which ones are real."
aww,Stella (Star in Latin)
aww,You've got this little guy ‚ù§Ô∏èüôå
aww,Did i come in crying? Or did i come in with a joke? Grow up
aww,Surely I could try. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
aww,He is so darn precious!!!! Oh my goodness!!!
aww,you sure you are his boyfriend?
aww,Why would we care?
aww,"I agree, please post when he does ‚ù§Ô∏è"
aww,I agree fellow stable human.
aww,"I used to have to put socks on my dachshund mix at bedtime, or he would stay up all night licking his paws! Total baby sock of shame."
aww,"Most dogs spend time both in the house and outside of the house-not many dogs do great being left outside all the time, at all. 

And not cropping a dog's tail when it literally causes them pain and possible infection when they wag it is cruel. I had a German shorthair cross and we ended up needing to have his tail cropped because he hurt himself so many times, and the risk of infection was high. It's a legitimate medical need in some cases."
aww,Our greyhound broke his leg and kept chewing on the enormous cast so we put one of my knee socks over it and problem solved. Very stylish.
aww,Nice Name for a nice cat
aww,I would move back for him\her.
aww,It's little but is sooo cute!
aww,"My neighbors have two good sized pits in a fairly small enclosure. I almost never see them out walking them, not that it doesn‚Äôt happen, but it‚Äôs really sad. I know they are in the cage minimum 22 hours a day. They can‚Äôt run or anything. They just bark and nip at each other. They aren‚Äôt malnourished or anything like that, but that doesn‚Äôt make it better to me."
aww,Gizmo. Or Gizzy for short. Or Kizzy a twist on Kitty.
aww,"They evolve. first they learn how to stand on 2 feet,then they learn how to use tools and in no time  the world is belongs to them."
aww,"One of my cats is nuts for fruit of any kind. She‚Äôll steal my apple core if I don‚Äôt dispose of it immediately - which I do because apple seeds can be toxic if ingested in large quantities and I‚Äôm paranoid.

We also can‚Äôt keep bananas in the apartment because she hunts them down and destroys them, peel and all. There‚Äôs nowhere she won‚Äôt invade to get to them."
aww,"i mean, you obviously came out on top, but why didn't you go to the dinner too?"
aww,All cats deserve this hug &lt;3
aww,Hell yeah! Get out of his way!
aww,"Raising baby animals is the best right?! It‚Äôs so rewarding, especially when they can return to their place in nature. Thank you for sharing this!"
aww,"I had a similar relationship with my smol good boy. Though instead of being the one who usually walked him. I was the one he slept with. He slept in my room, on my bed or in his doggy bed by the foot of mine, right so I could reach him with my hand. When he wanted to relax and do nothing, he went to me.

When I moved out he refused to leave my room whenever he wasn't eating or outside for a full week, he was restless for quite a while because he didn't have his chilling buddy that would just give him love, warmth and so many pats... Whenever I visit my mom now he immediately goes to my side or lies on me to feel my warmth again, even after six years of not living together. I am his snuggle buddy for life. I am also the only one still that he allows to pick him up without protest, and he will lie in my arms on his back belly up completely relaxed... He will struggle so much when anyone else tries it."
aww,He looks how I feel right meow.
aww,Impossible to watch this and not smile
aww,"It takes so little to make them sooooooo happy. There are times I don't really feel like walking my dog.........but as soon as I see his face, off we go......:)"
aww,These paws are too cute.
aww,We can't all feed children to our pets
aww,Have Frenchie here. Can confirm they are able to breathe.
aww,I hope the cat name is jasmine
aww,"Reminds me of my boy Rocky. He was such a sweet boy, lo loved attention. Slept in my bed and came to me and hid during thunderstorms. I keep a small stuffed animal of a black lab in the front of my car, so now he comes with me everywhere."
aww,I love to see animals so happy!!!
aww,"Actually, it was episode 3 aka ""The Long Night"". Aired April¬†28,¬†2019."
aww,This is why I don‚Äôt trust pot lucks.
aww,Your cat is gorgeous!
aww,"HE'S SOOO HAPPY!! He loves you and he knows you love him!! And now Im crying. Where the fuck is my mutt, I need to hug her."
aww,Oh yea. I buy the baby socks to put on my dogs feet when she is particularly licky with them.
aww,Probably just angry because the next book won't be out until after the Sun consumes our planet.
aww,"Hmmm I have more than an ample yard but my pit mix hates being outside, maybe you should stop assuming that just because a dog is inside it‚Äôs neglect"
aww,Mine does as well.
aww,"Do you, do you really not know what a smile is? It‚Äôs when the edges of your mouth curve upward. Really complicated for someone like you. I get it."
aww,"One of these puppies are going to be mine, I think there is a two year wait for this breeder. But I can promise you some photos. 

Not sure if that will help you or not."
aww,"cats can't thrive on only chicken, they need the extra nutrients that's in cat food for their bodies to run properly. a high quality cat food is obviously better than a cheap one, but cats should be eating some kind of food formulated for them and not just plain chicken.

aww,This is not my dog unfortunately. I want to say it‚Äôs a staffie of some sort?
aww,"Oh wait, I am actually crying"
aww,look at how cute she is :)

aww,Her life will be easier in a couple weeks once I take one of those lightly toasted babies home.
aww,"You know, in retrospect, yours makes more sense."
aww,my room mate as his dog's paw print tattoo'd on his inner arm. The vet made an ink print of the dog's paw after he passed and he took that ink print to the tattoo artist and they just made a stencil of it and copied it onto his arm.  Not much more to it than that
aww,"Jake was my Mom‚Äôs dog. I have a black lab now, a girl named Lana. Jake was the biggest lab I‚Äôd ever seen. He weighed 110 lbs. Lana is like 65. Jake felt more like an actual brother. He was just always there to clown around and watch me crush brews and go for long walks around his favorite ponds. Wise boy. I feel like I learned more from him in the silence and scenery we shared.

aww,"If it wasn't for the stigma attached to ""aborted"" we could save and improve so many who are alive RIGHT NOW. I'm so happy for you guys to have seen such positive results - having been injured years ago with a long recovery (nowhere near as hard as your journey not even going to pretend) I know how doing something as simple as being able to walk on your own can motivate someone for years to come. This brightened my day and definitely many others!"

aww,omg what a sweetie! I wouldnt leave my house ever Lol
aww,"No tanks, no more."
aww,He's got Japanese eyes!.  :P
aww,Yeah. You can tell he's not just excited for the walk. He's excited for the walk WITH OP.
aww,"Came for the kittens and laughed at the human.

Thanks for making me laugh.

This was like eating ice cream after a long hot day."
aww,"Well, after seeing that smile I sure did!"
aww,"Not if i keep my crystal boof kit securely rammed up my ass, that way my chakras will align and your oils will have no effect on me."
aww,Your dog's front legs apepar to me phasing through eachother (if you look hard enough).
aww,What! A! Boss!!!! Keep at it dude!
aww,Fair enough. Rehab stations are no zoos tho.
aww,Oh it's an actual baby polar bear. Was trying to figure out what kind of dog it was
aww,"I couldn't agree more with the ""aborted"" thing. I'm glad you understand how very exciting this is for not only me, but him and the rest of our family"
aww,Tell him some dude from Malaysia is keeping him in prayer and he shall fully recover soon .he's a strong warrior man...
aww,"She really does have it down. I have an overwhelming urge to say ""It's okay"" in baby talk and give here a box of milk-bones."
aww,"Meh. That‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt see the problem with trying something out so long as a medical professional gives their okay. Even if it just brings someone comfort or peace of mind. I don‚Äôt think a crystal can cure anything, but if it helps someone to relax or feel more comfortable, whatever. It‚Äôs not harming anything. 

But that‚Äôs the key thing - you need to make sure it won‚Äôt harm anything. Animals have different tolerances and sensitivities and it‚Äôs always best to be safer versus being sorry."
aww,"Nice. I had the pleasure of actually seeing and touching a nest once when I was a little kid. Eggs are tiny like jumbo Tic Tacs, and are super fragile. Dont try to handle them please unless you're a pro. Which I wasn't...it was honestly an accident  üò¢."

aww,That comment escalated quickly.
aww,"More contentment grimace than smile, the owner has found a 'spot'.

Dogs 'smile' when their mouths are open,  tongue hanging out, panting, eyes bright, ears perked forward, tail up; generally happy disposition is a full body 'smile'."
aww,Why is it bad for them?
aww,That's just nasty. No concept of hygiene.
aww,It is amazing that I can sit for hours with my dog without saying a word. The look on his face seems to tell me everything I need to know from him.

aww,Upvote for fellow kitty parent. üíû
aww,"Topic of dogs isn't too big on priorities list. That is why I won't search for evidences. If you don't agree then I am wrong. Which is fine by me. If there was more interesting topic (for me) I would made search. I brought upvotes just to show you I am not the only one. One of the excuses I've seen is ""so the other dog doesn't bite them off"". I won't engage more in this. It just doesn't matter. Maybe you have a dog and you do care. But it is different for me."

aww,"Mostly the sugar and calories. Some dogs can also be lactose intolerant. Going by the ""lining up"" bit, it seems to me the dog does this often. If it aint fat yet, it will be. I get yelled at when I sneak my dogs a small bit of cheese.

edit: if it was another flavor the risks would be greater, vanilla being relatively harmless for dogs.  
edit2: this explains better than i can. When it mentions the ""once in a blue moon"" part, refer to my comment about how routine the dog was doing this.  [https://www.rover.com/blog/can-dog-eat-vanilla-ice-cream/](https://www.rover.com/blog/can-dog-eat-vanilla-ice-cream/)"
aww,YES! I can't imagine how this must have felt for him and your family. You should consider sourcing the guy some Oxandrolone. It has shown incredible potential for helping with many neuromusuclar conditions - including this one.
aww,"American football only makes sense if you‚Äôve been to a game. I think it‚Äôs popularity is due to it‚Äôs   being a central part of American high school culture.

aww,"I asked a vet about this, they highly advised against a homemade diet. They claim that cats have a very balanced nutrient need. 


Might be full bullshit but I didn‚Äôt want to chance it. He said that it required many nutrients in powder form and measuring it precisely.

aww,I fucking love science and love that kid and his proud family.
aww,"I wanted desperately to post this on your adorable pibble post, but I see the comments are locked. Probably for the very reason I was desperate to post it. Anyhow, know that even though they are misunderstood, this gorgeous girl is a great spokespupper! Keep the faith! 
Here is my intended post:
I have a very special place in my heart for pibbles. They are so misunderstood, often to the point of having to euthanize them for no reason other than the fact they are pibbles. It makes me sad. But then I see videos like this, banner puppies for the cause! And I am uplifted!"

aww,I thought cats couldn't taste sugar? I wonder what a strawberry tastes like to a cat.
aww,The research the linked for DMD was mouse-gene based and advised caution translating to humans. It's a five year old article as well. Interesting something with such a profound response in your case would have so little literature associated with it.
aww,"the raw chicken used for feeding animals and the raw chicken you get at the supermarkets are not the same thing.

the chicken you get at the supermarket is for humans to cook and eat, not for animals."
aww,"I've had 4 cats, not one of them jumped on the counters.  Even the ballsiest one we had would rarely get on the computer desk because they were simply *never* allowed to be on the counters or desks.   I do not accept or understand all of the people here claiming it's impossible to train your cat.  No different than people who pretend it's impossible to train a friendly dog to not lick people's faces- no, you just suck at pet training.
  
Furthermore, yeah, you can clean the counters.  You can also clean porcelein and I still wouldn't eat off your toilet no matter how clean you presented it, that's still gross.  So is toilet paws on kitchen counters."
aww,"I lost my Roxy last September and I was devastated for a few months, but now it hurts a little less and the surges aren‚Äôt frequent, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything because right now how you feel is so bad - probably like a hippo is sitting on your chest, your every breathe is weighed down and heavy breathes just don‚Äôt seem to relieve that pressure...but it‚Äôll all be better, you‚Äôll never move on but it‚Äôs good, it meant she had an impact on your life and that‚Äôs as good as any can expect when they pass. Even if you get another animal, that animal won‚Äôt replace her but it doesn‚Äôt have to, you can love more than 1 thing.

My best friends in the world (siblings) have muscular dystrophy pretty bad.  I can't recall which kind at the moment, sorry.  Watching them go from skinny but active kids to wheelchair bound over our lives (I have known them for almost 30 years) has been tough.  
I admire their strength to stay positive in the face of this horrible, horrible affliction every damn day.  They are literally facing down their mortality, and they still manage to stay cool dudes.
I've helped them out whenever possible, and helped charities that fight this.  I don't have any hope that it will be cured in my lifetime, but any progress that can be made to help those afflicted with it.....that makes it worth my time."

aww,"Pro-tip - the person you're responding to is not knowledgable on this. Ask a vet, not the internet. No, just because many cat-foods have mostly corn in them doesn't mean they're bad for your cat. They are specifically formulated to be good for them.

aww,"Trust me, it surprised us too! He was such a small kitten..."
aww,Squeeeee...... Bunny pigs are the best!
aww,you walk him without a leash? There‚Äôs no way that would work with my dog
aww,"How long from the first therapy until walking?  Though this looks like a huge improvement, does it look like full functionality is possible?  Any drawbacks?"
aww,"Cats don't get everything they need from chicken. Cat food has a number of different things required from organs and other parts of whatever animal is in the food. 

Just buy decent cat food and not the cheap shit stuff."
aww,Where is this and how can I make this my Life
aww,"Yes. It should strengthen all the muscles, Including those surrounding his heart....his heart health was the main reason for deciding to spend the $18,000+ on the therapy/transplant"
aww,I LOVE how he casually shooed the dog out of the way. Coming through!!! Congrats!
aww,"Looky, looky I got hooky"
aww,Good for him for continuing the fight. Love the smile he had on his face. Such an inspiration. Rock on little man.

aww,"This is the reason I enjoy Reddit 
Not garbage reposts etc

aww,"I m entitled to voice my own opinion, budüíú"
aww,"He got his stem cell therapy done December 15th and he just took his ""first steps"" on Sunday. We aren't positive about full functionality, although we are optimistic. No drawbacks thus far."

aww,"I usually bake the chicken thighs with the skin on at 350 for 30-45 minutes, then I remove the skin and bones and mince the chicken. Afterwards I pour the remaining chicken fat from the pan into the minced chicken so it stays nice and moist for the kitties."
aww,"We decided together it's not cool for us to put our current lives on hold for what might be any number of years down the road...we both have a lot going on in each of our worlds and me asking her to wait for me or vise versa just isn't fair.

aww,"""Ah shit... Here we go again"""
aww,"Moar progress!,We wanna see him run soon!!!"
aww,I have three dogs that are my entire world. I still don‚Äôt let them counter surf or put their nasty paws where someone might eat.  It‚Äôs not unreasonable to set rules and boundaries for your pets.
aww,I think he kicked some dirt up into my eyes at the end there.
aww,"Canned cat food isn't horrible unless you are buying cheap stuff. There are a lot of added vitamins and minerals in most good cat foods that they can't get simply from eating chicken/one protein. I also think the dry food is good for cleaning their teeth.

If you're going for cheap, then yes maybe store chicken is better...but if you invest a bit more then the cat food is actually much more well-rounded for them."
aww,"My cat starts tapping on my arm. ""HEY!"""
aww,Thank you. Your comment warmed the crap out of my heart
aww,"I mean, ‚Äústealing content to farm karma‚Äù sounds stupid. But really the idea that you guys think that is what is happening is even stupider than it sounds. 

People see funny shit on the interwebs. They think, hey, I know some other dumbasses who would also think this is funny. 

Sure, some people actually care about the karma, and sure it is cool to get updoots, but out of the millions of people on reddit I think it‚Äôs safe to assume most don‚Äôt give a fuck. We like to look at funny shit while we shit."
aww,She is a stunner.
aww,Melt my heart. Ugh..
aww,That would be the other cat. She's not a big fan of all the sounds and smells the little guy makes.

aww,"It's not just that but my knife set is on the counter. My mixer is on the counter. 

So at best, there is now cat hair everywhere. At worst, shit that I dont think to wipe off because my knife set is in a block (but who knows if my cats batted the set or something).

My cats know not to get on counters due to training. It's just cleanliness. I clean my counters but wiping them down is different if I catch one cat being a naughty bastard. Bleach spray then, but usually I just wipe it with hot water."
aww,god damn i really need a cat
aww,Nice notes and bad days deserve ice cream cones!
aww,He will grow up a strong wrestler!
aww,"Hey thanks info, its a really neat attribute.  üëç"
aww,"To cats chicken actually doesn't smell like much. I've had great success with turkey, as well as rabbit and venison (his favorite). Fish is not specie appropriately for cats although it's strong smell usually attracts them. Have you tried ziwi peak or feline natural's wet food? We've had great success with those, or freeze dried food that we can rehydrate."
aww,I had an old black lab that would react like this when I came home from college on breaks I almost cried watching this what a good dog

aww,What a cheerful little video :)
aww,"This is amazing!! I work for an organization helping patients get to and from clinical trials in the US,  many with DMD, and I can only hope they one day see this kind of progress!"
aww,"I trained mine with a squirt bottle and a sharp noise, kind of like a sharper ""psst!"" Now they respond to the noise alone. 

If you catch them, even just looking at it I would do that. They're still going to be assholes because they're cats, but maybe you can curb it some?"
aww,Will you draw my buddy Bolt on my profile pretty please? These look so great!
aww,close it you monster kitty just want sleep
aww,That's just plain not true. Food standards are a lot higher here.
aww,thought it was a fish at first haha
aww,Would you hate me if I asked how much that costs? So excited for you and your son either way! Best of luck moving forward.

aww,"I love the hand motion that basically says, ""Come on, you know the deal. Get outta my way, IM WALKIN HERE!"""
aww,One of the best jobs in the world I'm sure
aww,"‚ÄúOk I‚Äôm going, sorry what did you say? You want me to stay?‚Äù"
aww,"i'd agree with you, if op didn't literally and very obviously present this as their pet and their video.
it takes 2 seconds to source the things you share. it takes 0 not to pretend it's yours. unfortunately for karma farmers, doing either of those things makes the post potentially worth less for them.
in short: there's people who share things for the sake of sharing, this isn't one of them."
aww,wow I love him
aww,Definitely got those old man hips. My old girl runs the same way. MSM has helped out immensely I really can't recommend it enough. It took her back a couple of years at least.
aww,what a very fine sugarface boy.....so happy to see you
aww,He can already stand sassily waiting for something to move! That‚Äôs awesome!
aww,Doesn't matter what your vaping.  As long as it keeps you off the stinks.

aww,That fear and sadness really breaks the heart I pray to God that every single one of em gets a happy comfy home
aww,Aww bless. His face made me so happy.
aww,My friend died from this not too long ago. Heartbreaking to think of what could have been for him. He was an incredible man. So happy to see what it‚Äôs doing for your son. Absolutely amazing.
aww,The very best part of this is the trophy presentation.üòπ
aww,But then who would give scratchies and snuggles and walks and come home from long trips?  Humans and dogs together &gt; either one by themselves.
aww,My heart melted. This is so sweet.
aww,He‚Äôs already the best ‚ò∫Ô∏è
aww,Haha. No I would not. The therapy/transplant itself cost $18000. Obviously that doesn't include the travel to and from San Diego
aww,Why are we not funding this!!?
aww,I graciously accept and would like to reciprocate your offer.
aww,"I read: my cat is obese with strawberries.

But yeah, same"
aww,What the fuck? They can do that now? That's the most amazing thing I've read in a long damn time. Good work!
aww,I can't believe you've done this. I trusted you.
aww,"People love chicken meat but the organs that we consider gross ""byproduct"" are often far more healthy for cats. Most things cats would eat in the wild are mostly organs with a small bit of meat. Organs have way more fatty acids and vitamins than a chicken breast or thigh would."
aww,that is awesome!!!! I should do that with my dogs' prints :)
aww,I back it 100%. Happy for you and I hope stem cell therapy becomes more legal in the US and FAST
aww,I have never wanted a baby polar bear so much until now.
aww,You havent walked him for 7 years tho?Have you at least visited?
aww,"Jet, Onyx, or Thirteen"
aww,I want to do this for my boy. He's 10.5 but hates when you touch his feet.
aww,1 word: pharmeceuticals ü§¨ it would basically stop lining their pockets if stem cell therapy became a real thing (here in the US anyways)
aww,I try to avoid rice when it has eyeballs.
aww,"OMG, that cat is super beautiful."
aww,You mean human slave
aww,Aaaaaaand now you'll never have rice without hair ever again.
aww,This guy reminds me of my 13 yr old black lab I had to put down in Feb. this year. I like how he keeps looking back at you to make sure you are following.
aww,Such a good boy
aww,I love how they dance üòä
aww,Love seeing your older lab so happy!   Their hearts are so big that it gives them superpowers.  We have a 12.5 year old black lab and a 8.5 year old black lab &amp; they are the best!
aww,You are as surprised as I was when I watched a documentary on the success stories
aww,You're a lucky guy.
aww,"Adorable. :-) 

BTW what‚Äôs all that green stuff? (Desert dweller)"
aww,"He looks angry/happy while eating it, really confusing, what are your feelings towards this strawberry, cat ?"
aww,I couldn't agree more. Thank you!
aww,Cats go batshit for olives too.
aww,"Minus the deaf, you have my boy cat. We spray him with water right between his eyes and it takes maybe 6 sprays to realize that this is not normal. Girl cat however will run into the other room if you pick up something that looks like the spray bottle."
aww,"Well many birds CAN be quiet, but it depends on the breed and temperament. Mine mostly just likes to call my name when he is bored/hungry but I've never really heard him screech or anything, he will also occasionally flail his toys around when he gets in trouble. But obviously you gotta go into it assuming the worst haha"
aww,I have a 115lb choco that is my love. Same same. She is Teddy Broosevelt.
aww,Why are we not funding this?!
aww,"He's a big, sweet bear!  üêª"
aww,Are there some canned cat food brands that don‚Äôt have a bunch of fillers that you‚Äôre aware of?
aww,You can't leave us hanging like that!
aww,"I get it but why 'inflating' the value of karma. Those are just numbers on a screen for posting mostly useless stuff to be seen by random strangers. If people vote for something you post, even if it's stolen content or not, at the end of the day you are not richer."
aww,"Ok, take a nap. Then, fire ze missiles!!!"
aww,This is so fuxking awesome. Good for him! He seem to be enjoying it! Hopefully one day he wont need that walker!
aww,"i like that he had left the tip of his tail out knowing burying his head would cover it, clever pickle."
aww,"The short answer is, we are. And there is lots of money going into stem cell therapies from many industries, including big pharma.

The issue is that the process for evaluating these therapies has only recently been developed and we cannot say that they are safe and effective. As someone who researches stem cells and stem cell therapies on a daily basis, the ""stem cell tourism"" issue may become very dangerous in a few years as more people are driven to less reputable clinics for ""life saving"" therapies. One of the largest dangers being that in our hands, stem cell injections can quickly turn into tumors, while providing limited therapeutic benefit.

I don't want to take anything away from OP, they clearly did their research with the limited information that is out there and are only trying to do right by their child. I hope them many years of quality life together."
aww,May you be united with him in the other life
aww,That fresh dug earth is nice and cool.
aww,Did you just try to explain how to feed a cat to a vet tech?
aww,"Aaawe, you can see his old man hips go a little bit in one of those jumps. Getting old sucks."
aww,My mum and dad used to have a load of Alpine Strawberry plants in their garden then one year they suddenly appeared to stop fruiting.  Turns out that their bastard of a cat realised that it too was obsessed with strawberrys and learned to wait until they just turned pink to snaffle them at their best.
aww,"Steep price but the wiki goes on to mention that the additional revenue from Knut was about ‚Ç¨5,000,000 (not to mention and licensing or merchandising deals!). Not too bad of an ROI there.

aww,"I only once surprised my cat eating a mouse, usually i just find the bile. Anyway it was a big one like the size of a lemon. My cat bit it in half in 4sec. and swallowed the two pieces each in about another 4 seconds. Oddly she left no bile and gave me a look like i seen something that has not meant to be seen. 

So literally the whole mouse, no leftovers."
aww,An evil person. We‚Äôve only had him a week and he‚Äôs only now starting to come out of his shell

aww,Old dogs are the best dogs.
aww,What is this picture and should I report
aww,"My cats look at strawberries like they are deadly aliens from a cat hating world.

Did you dip it in fish oil?"
aww,"Agreed, I'm like you and think abortion should be a sort of last-resort thing. (That said, I'd absolutely never shame another woman for it as I'm sure it's not a decision made lightly by most people. Unless she's literally bragging about it, but most aren't like that) However, I like that the life can still be given purpose like this, and it makes me happy that people like OP's child can benefit medically :) like you said, it's gonna happen anyways, and why not change lives with it?"
aww,Good doggy. Such a good doggy.

aww,"Thank you. She is my heart, I am lucky to have her as my daughter."
aww,"The relief you feel when the tiger wasn't charging you, it just wanted to chill on top of your car. Seriously that first second of the cat coming towards me would have had me shitting my pants.

Also awwww"
aww,"You‚Äôve made me curious so I googled it and this is what I found. 

&gt; Stick insects are herbivorous, eating only plants and vegetation. They eat berries, vines, and leaves. They feed at night. They also eat fabric textiles."
aww,"Before I got into rehabbing myself I worked with many others and they all say the same, it‚Äôs useless to bring in a bird after a little ding against a window. You‚Äôre supposed to give them an hour or two to see if they recover, if they don‚Äôt that‚Äôs when you bring them in. But a lot of unnecessary work can be prevented by just giving the bird a few minutes to recover. If they have severe internal injuries they won‚Äôt be flying off within an hour. The ones that do are fine and if they‚Äôre not that‚Äôs natural selection. But don‚Äôt bother busy rehabs with needless ‚Äúrescues‚Äù when they don‚Äôt need help. Anyone with a bit of common sense can recognize if a bird really needs help or if they‚Äôre just dazed. But you‚Äôre needlessly adding work to rehabbers that are already short on time by bringing birds that don‚Äôt really need care. Let them spend the time and money on critters that really need it. Most places don‚Äôt have the luxury of having a large facility nearby and are dependent on small private rehabbers and they have better things to do than stare at a bird for 5 minutes till it flies away."
aww,They are in San Diego. Obviously you have to travel to Mexico because it's illegal here in the US
aww,"Me as it jumped: ""THE PAINT!"""
aww,"Yeah pets cant live in a healthy manner solely off chicken and organs.

Pet food in general is very high in nutrients that just feeding meat lacks.

And that process takes years and tons of money, while people are suffering and dying.  It's great that the FDA has a strong process for proving safety and effectiveness.  There also needs to be a process for people to accept the risks of using non-FDA approved treatments."

aww,"* Kneading - quick little stabbings of your chest then stops
* Sharpening claws - does it on the carpet instead of the scratch pad. Which is fine since she does it wrong (doesn't actually dig her claws in), so there are no tears and her claws stay untrimmed
* Burying poop - digs furiously for a few seconds then stands in the hole and poops on top of the litter on the side
* Cleaning paws - she's finally figured this one out, but she used to just swim one of her paws in the water till it was soaking wet - and then not lick it - while the other was completely dry
* Attempting to jump onto the windowsill - jumps straight up and tries to pull herself onto it using her front paws"

I didn't say it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience; I could see the person was very young; I am old, and I remember fondly every close encounter I have ever had with wild birds.  I was speaking to the thrilled kid, not to you. Lighten up, for God's sake."
aww,"So our super playful cat (Nia) went missing about 2 months ago. Really devastating, put in a missing report with spca. Today we got a call, picked her up and brought her home.

Since she‚Äôs been back her old friend (our lovely loyal dog [Blu]) has been watching over her and sleeping next to her box. I love these two animals more than words can describe."

Two patients with macular degeneration had stem cells injected into their eyes and went blind. Another had stem cells injected into their back where a tumor ended up growing because of it. Those are the problems that I have with this. 

But isn't this the current process? People travel abroad or find a clinic in the US for treatment? I just wanted to warn of the dangers, that is all. Stem cells hold so much potential, the scientific process is very slow."

aww,My grandma's dog has a condition that causes him to lose his hair periodically. My mom and I went to visit her and he was wearing my mom's old band shirts. Dog sorta looks like an orange american eskimo and he had on a KISS shirt. Pretty hilarious.

aww,My cat acts very weirdly around strawberries. If we leave any out he'll start sniffing them and rubbing his mouth against them. If he does this for long enough he eventually pisses on them..
aww,"i honestly have no idea why people would farm karma, it's not something i really care to look into. my first guesses would be either to boost ego in some way or, if i'm being a bit more cynical, sell accounts."
aww,"For years, my dad at allergic to cats. Until one day when he went over to a friend's house and had a young Siamese kitty curl up in his lap and claim him as her own. My mom delighted in feeding back all the excuses he'd given over the years for not having a cat. But he got the cat.
 
I was away at college at the time. Every time I came home from college, the cat would go into heat. Loud, yowling, siamese heat. My parents told me it was just me."
aww,"This is adorable! My cat doesn't like healthy foods but she goes nuts for macaroni, fruit snacks, or blueberry muffins."
aww,"I mean, that animal is also allowed to sit *on the people themselves*. Buying a pet would be cruel if one was this unhappy about touching them or them touching things lmao. And there's literally no way to train a cat to not jump on high things unless you're lucky and you do it whilst they're young (or you make them completely scared and miserable by spraying them every time they jump on anything; I once saw a rescue cat that was like that, and he was distressed and hiding for like the next 4 years of his life afterwards).

And if it still really bothers you, I'd look up the amount of fecal matter that is sprayed everywhere when you flush a toilet. There's human shit all over every single bathroom, and most peoples' hands as well. :)"
aww,I love these! Wish I could buy them in the form of stickers!
aww,Maybe you shouldn't offer advice when you have no idea what you're talking about.  I know it feels good to pretend but maybe it's not for the best?  Maybe instead of starving them there's better methods?
aww,"I dont think this is terrible because dry food helps to clean their teeth and cats often have dental issues/bad breath.  As long as the ingredients in the food are quality, it should not be an issue with feeding dry food."

aww,"My dog is two months shy of 17. Every now and then he shows that kind of zip, but it isn't very often. This post has me a little choked up."
aww,"Just FYI.... don't actually do this.  Vet up above pointed out why it's a bad idea, if that's needed, although it seems obvious you don't just feed them chicken forever and call it a day. That is not the road to a healthy cat with a well-balanced diet."

aww,"You may also be able to sponsor a bird from a local shelter to take care of until another family (or you) decide to adopt it. Might help give you a chance to experience it before committing to an animal that could very possibly outlive you.

aww,Jesus nutter types?! Hahahaa!!!
aww,Trying? That boi has mastered the doggy somersault.
aww,"They also just won't drink enough.  Just ""eh, not thirsty"" to the point that they fuck up their kidneys and need daily subcu fluids by the time they're older.  I work at an animal hospital and I see multiple cats a day that require fluids this way.  Cats can do some dumb shit."

aww,"Strawberries are safe for cats but I believe there is chemical in them similar to catnip.  My mom‚Äôs cat used to roll around on them, and my mom would freeze all the little stems and leaves for him, and then she would bring a few out for him to play with.  I swear he was stoned."
aww,"That poor damn thing. Tell your friend to put that cat on a diet, and that they shouldn't own an animal."

aww,yeah does some cat whisperer wanna tell us why this cat is sick and dying
aww,Punish him with a belly rub
aww,Should have kept him as a pet
aww,"Yes, yes it is"
aww,"Yep, seconded. I have a cat that flat out refuses to touch wet food or meat. We did a lot of research and we feed her the best quality dry food we could find. If we stopped providing dry food to try and ‚Äútrain‚Äù her preferences, I‚Äôm confident she would refuse food to the point of malnourishment, so we‚Äôre not going to do that."

aww,"Totally agree -- but you're feeding them a food that will likely lead to a painful and expensive health problem.   

Trying to avoid that is called preventative health.

aww,"I wish I were half as talented with watercolor as you are. I never could get the hang of them. 

Also, stay away from my oyster bed."
aww,Be careful not to make him super sore! Labs have hip problems and my sister came to visit and took mine for a long walk/run and the next day we literally had to take him to the vet because of the pain he was in üòÖ it‚Äôs kinda funny after the fact cuz he was just sore.. but I had to watch him all day for a week!
aww,"Damn you schools wifi, let me watch the kittens!!!"
aww,"I probably enjoyed that more than I should have, life for us is so complicated, seeing a hamster frump his way through a maze made my mid-day.

aww,The title is that happens but the original video was during the time when people would say how golden retrievers can hold eggs in their mouth without breaking them
aww,"Shame, I had a floofy ginger Dave years ago. But yeah weird with the step dad thing."
aww,Even with a birth defect that dog is more handsome than me
aww,"Congratulations!  Amazing to see.

Also, this thread has been incredibly informative and very interesting."
aww,"Rodents don't like that they like to stick to walls because they have poor eyesight, however at witnessing mouse infestations, if there are overcrowding or things blocking the walls they will do that."
aww,"What a happy, derpy, good boy."
aww,So because it applies to you that means it‚Äôs the same for everyone? Go away
aww,"Reminds me of how my cat used to fall asleep on window sills. We tried to stop her because she kept falling falling off in her sleep but she was stubborn.

One day she managed to badly skin *both* her knees on the heater as she fell. Which then required medical attention that meant we had to hold her down daily to change her dressings and put some medicine that stinged on her raw knees.

Its been 8 years and she still doesn't go on window sills."
aww,"Of fucking course she's screaming, you would too is somebody kept waking you up and shoving a camera in your face /s"
aww,"Very funny.

But if you try hard and you will success."

aww,Get the hell out of the way man. Kid has places to be. Geez.
aww,"To be fair, there *are* legitimate points when it comes to ethical questions that has nothing to do with religion.

aww,"Awww I love this, what a good boy"
aww,"You dare disturb me, hooman?!"
aww,"Yeaahh. I have been getting in trouble lately for giving my dogs so much attention. 

My wife has been busy with finishing up school though and i am trying to make sure they don't feel neglected with how busy we have been."

aww,‚ÄúI‚Äôm not fucking crying‚Äù
aww,"Waited for someone to come in and say ""strawberries are toxic to cats"". Glad that they are not because this guy is enjoying it."
aww,"No worries! I see that people generally worry them selves over useless shit that is not important in life. 
Seeing a kid, that has real worries (not to mention you) achieve a giant thing like this is beyond words !"
aww,It looks like a heart!
aww,"They were a little rough, but I intervened in time. I believe he washed up in the floods we've had. Had they not brought him to me who knows what would have happened to him!"

aww,This comment got me. Nothing like laughing out loud in a quiet office.
aww,"The look on his face was the icing on the cake, especially when he asked whomever to move out of his way.  Really brightened up my day thanks for sharing; give him a high five from a random internet stranger for me."
aww,"My cat will eat meat... only if its been smoked. I have offered her every concieveable type of cooked/raw meat and the only thing she has ever eaten was smoked turkey, smoked chicken, really anything smoked."
aww,"I would have considered it.. but for a multitude of reasons, now is not the right time for me to take something like that on.

However, I warned the cats that if they bring me anymore babies that their ""punishment"" is to live with them."
aww,"Labs don‚Äôt have hip problems. Some individuals do. This is why getting a dog from a reputable breeder who does health screening and does their best to avoid hip dysplasia, and then doing your best to minimize the risks of developing it when they are growing puppies is important. Even then, there can still be flukes, but it‚Äôs nice to stack the deck in your and your dog‚Äôs favor. 

That said, *many* 13 year old dogs would be sore after a lot of activity, hip dysplasia or not, so it‚Äôs still good advice to try not to overdo it. Old dogs don‚Äôt heal as quickly as young ones. And then you have your freak cases, like my boxer - he was a stray and has hip dysplasia, but has never been lame a day in his life (he‚Äôll be 12 in July)."
aww,Something so funny about the way the video cuts out at the end
aww,Why did you name him Nibbler?
aww,"So, so cute! He was very talkative"
aww,"Cute in your house, but certainly not mine. I have nothing against birds, I just have 3 cats so this would have been a wildly different scenario to come home to and a whole other subreddit!"
aww,"I have to wonder. Would primates want to go back into the wild? Wouldn't they consider the people part of their ""tribe""? Feels like they could get more attached than other animals."
aww,"Baby murder cow, it‚Äôs cute until it crushes you skull with its dagger sized teeth"
aww,This put such a genuine smile on my face :)
aww,You's seem like a good dad. Keep it up friend.

aww,This is so damn cute! I would totally watch a little series of this with multiple mazes and prizes!
aww,"But, who wore it better?!?!"
aww,Why their ass so different than ours
aww,That's such a thoughtful thing for her to do!  Sometimes a little reminder of how much your kid loves you can make even the worst days feel better.
aww,"Please show us more strawberry-cat please, OP"
aww,I wish I could get that job. . .
aww,"Aww, what a precious little boy."
aww,My family didn‚Äôt know what to get me for my birthday.  I‚Äôm old as a dinosaur now I get to look like one!
aww,"Our girl didn't have her mama either, when she finally became a member of our family at 8 months old she had no idea how to cover up in the cat box. You can actually take their paw and show them how to cover the poop and they'll do it. I also had to teach her how to use a scratch pad, by raking my own nails across it. I only showed her how to cover in the cat box twice (in a clean box) and she got it."
aww,I need a dog in my life :(
aww,"I'd say I'm full of more wonder than most. I go out birdwatching before work almost every morning, and find joy in seeing even the most common birds. But at the same time it's troubling seeing so many birds killed by buildings, and people completely oblivious to the problem."
aww,....what wonderful creation for fluffy fur friend.....you are a very kind person
aww,My cat is obsessed with drinking the condensation off my cold water bottles.
aww,"Well that‚Äôs what my Vet said ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but yea, he‚Äôs 9 now. We got him joint supplements and we do shorter walks now."
aww,Obviously he cut it off and has it hanging around his neck to keep vampires away.

aww,she made little dog logs!
aww,Won¬¥t he be an outcast since he mells like a human or something?
aww,"Oh I wouldn't do that, at all. I just use chicken thighs for a lot of my recipes, so I'm like ""where the heck are thighs that cheap?!"""
aww,"I wonder if a hug like the chimp is giving them is a learned behaviour from being around humans or if they do that amongst themselves in the wild. 

Either way, this makes my heart happy"
aww,Hell yeah! Get some
aww,"1. Good canned / Pre-packaged food is not garbage
2. I don't know WHERE you live that you can get chicken for 99 cents, but no matter where it is, that's shit quality chicken full of chemicals and bred in horrible conditions
3. Keeping your pets on a diet that strict is a bad idea, they need a balanced diet, just like we do

&amp;#x200B;

But you do you."
aww,"I must admit that I started crying. Lost my own black lab of 13 years old last year, and damn I miss him. Your boy sounded just like him. Really lovely dog your have there!"
aww,"I wish the US would stop being so weird about stem cell research. My brother passed about 12 years ago because of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

aww,"Amazing! Bless you both with love, lovely walks and each other xx"
aww,What a sweet creature - he just exudes love.
aww,"My cat loves my nail files too! The same cat loves to eat silicone things also. He ate a silicone spoon rest, my swim goggle strap, and a silicone bunion pad. Weirdo."
aww,Wick question: did it show up on your blood test? I couldn‚Äôt be diagnosed with blood work so I had to wait for several years before I could start a treatment program :/
aww,What's a bonus dad?
aww,"&gt; Attempting to jump onto the windowsill - jumps straight up and tries to pull herself onto it using her front paws 

Oh. My. God. Videos of that would be amazing. Especially if they're still small."
aww,My old cat would have freaked out if you closed the lid on a container she was in.
aww,Where were you OP? üòâ
aww,everything about this was so thoughtful and creative....lucky creature to have such a great homeperson
aww,"Save it!  I saved all my kid‚Äôs notes, and love to go thru them in times of difficulty for some uplifting reflection."
aww,Cats are furry snakes with legs
aww,I thought I was the only one! A few of my cats used to go nuts batting an olive around the house. But my more recent cats didn't respond to it at all. Glad to know I'm not crazy.
aww,Gotta feed them the Sams Club rotisserie chicken
aww,His respect for the sport is unparalleled.

aww,"Cute, but what was with the kiss my ass in the beginning?"
aww,Bahahahah this is awesome
aww,"My cat is only 4 but I'm thinking about getting his paw print on my leg. He always steps on me and his little prints leave that red mark on my skin for a few seconds, so I want to get his paw print tattooed like he just stepped on me in the pinkish-red color."
aww,Energetic old pups are heartwarming :)
aww,"Holy shit, you weren't exaggerating, they literally look like samurais"
aww,We were on the big island a few years ago and the cats were EVERYWHERE.   Many of them very friendly.  Strange to see that many though.
aww,Butt in face is a serious sign of respect in a chimpanzee troupe.
aww,That guy looks like the male equivalent of someone who will eventually become a crazy cat lady.
aww,This is so adorable ‚ô•Ô∏è

aww,That's not rice. It's a cat!
aww,"He looks like Salvador Dali's dog
But he's still cute as hell"
aww,"It literally says they do all they can to remove it. Go look at the picture again.

No one is ""allowing"" anything. Short of them employing someone standing at every entrance all the hours they are open shooing it away what do you expect them to do?"
aww,Was expecting rice but I‚Äôm just as happy with this.
aww,"‚ÄúWTF is a dinning table? Does he mean dining table?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he means calf. Give him a calf.‚Äù"

aww,"I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!"

aww,I dont know why but I'm crying right now as I look at him. üò¢üò¢
aww,"Definitely a good idea! I've been keeping a lot of her stuff lately, this one though I may have to laminate since it's written with pencil."
aww,"Yeah, I‚Äôve heard that a bunch of times before and it REALLY vexes me. My girl Chani doesn‚Äôt give a shit about cereal (she will come sniff it then walk away), but when I‚Äôm eating ice cream she geeks out and I have to put her in the bathroom."

aww,haha dangit I was hoping to eat every one!
aww,I visited a cat adoption cafe in Brooklyn where the orphaned kittens are placed with rats in an enclosure at the beginning of their life so the rats can teach them how to groom themselves
aww,"That might be a good idea, but I am afraid to cage her outside because there are a lot of stray dogs that run around and sometimes coyotes."

aww,Going to break himself
aww,"Again, if you're a small rehabber working out of your home, it's fine to say you don't have the capacity to take in lots of birds. But you shouldn't generalize from that into making guidelines for the public that are not based in the evidence.  The fact that a bird flies off doesn't mean it will survive. And it's basically impossible to know whether it survived once it's gone. I've rescued birds that were very active but didn't survive in rehab."
aww,You sure it's not a tiger cub?

aww,"Yeah I know what's going to happen, same every year :("
aww,"Not an evolutionary biologist, so feel free to correct me or provide more details reddit. We humans evolved to walk upright on land on our two hind legs, and the chimps evolved to swing amongst tree branches. Our gluteus maximi help us walk and especially run long distances with relative ease. IIRC, our massive asses are an anomaly in the animal kingdom in general."

aww,I'm not crazy about a lot of pet costumes but this one is pretty great.
aww,"There are break-away collars, I got one for my cat. Very very useful and handy. The only reason I suggest collars in particular is because if its an outdoor cat, people in the neighborhood know it is owned and will prevent them from taking it in, bringing it to a shelter, etc."
aww,I love how many armchair experts mechanisms we can see in reddit sometimes. This little comment is very sad.
aww,"Because aww is only for animals? No. To me, it's for shit that warms your heart and gives you all the feels. Fuck off üòÅ"
aww,The victory song was my favorite.
aww,"Oh alright, that makes sense now. Very cool and congrats to her!"
aww,Where did you get that video of me? DELETE IT IMMEDIATELY
aww,"Labs are more prone to it, partially because they are large breeds and partially because poor breeders run rampant in the breed, since it‚Äôs such s common and popular breed. But it‚Äôs not an automatic thing that every lab has bad hips. 

Joint supplements are great! You might also ask your vet about adding in a fish oil/omega 3 supplement, such as Welactin or even just the stuff for humans. It‚Äôs also anti-inflammatory and supports overall health, including joint health. Duralactin is another good supplement to consider - it‚Äôs a long-term anti-inflammatory supplement made from milk protein."
aww,This is the best thing I've seen all week! My heart is filled with joy for your son and your family :)
aww,Pfft. 68 is not cold. Are you front Toronto? :D
aww,Be careful letting him spend so much energy! His body might make him pay for it next day. It‚Äôs so beautiful to see him so excited and energetic though üò≠üíúüíú
aww,"Honestly to dogs we must be like the elves in Lord of the Rings. These wiser beings capable of things they can‚Äôt even imagine or understand, living for many times longer than them, always aware of things they can‚Äôt comprehend, but mostly benevolent and kind. 

That dog seeing you when he‚Äôs an ‚Äúold man‚Äù would be like you having a best friend when you were a teen who disappeared, only to reappear when you‚Äôre in your nineties (7x13) and he‚Äôs barely aged at all, still happy to see you and pick up where you left off."

aww,He still loves his big brother the best üò≠üíúüíú
aww,It's so adorable! Once when I was visiting my in-laws' their German Shepherd flat out refused to go for a walk with his dad and sulked for a solid 10 minutes (not normal). Only when I stood up to go to the kitchen and he started bouncing about and brought me his lead did we realise he just wanted me to come üò≠ We were like ok I guess I'm coming to the woods too then üòÇ
aww,That is so cool and cute that you taught her to cat!
aww,Cute! But also felt stifling seeing the plastic tube part.
aww,"Ah, now that makes more sense. Thanks for clearing that up."
aww,"Also, I don‚Äôt use essential oils. Nice assumption though, bro. I just have common sense. You do realize that people have existed for a really long time, and although they had shorter life spans and died of many diseases that are curable today, they still used natural compounds to make themselves feel better/stop them from shitting all over themselves...."

aww,"Hi Francis-X-Clampazzo! Thanks for posting to /r/aww. Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

**Rule #1:** Please don't post ""sad"" content, such as pics of animals that have passed away (try /r/petloss) or sob stories (e.g. found him in a dumpster).

* Your title must be ""100% happy"". No mentioning death, injury, RIP posts, finding abandoned animals, sick/survived cancer, pets being put to sleep, ""I miss..."", etc. You may tell the complete story, unhappy parts and all, in the comments section.

* Silver lining stories still fall under Rule 1. For example, ""Jakey was hit by a car and had cancer, but he is a happy little fella today!"" is not allowed.



If you have questions about this, please [contact our mods via moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Faww) rather than replying here. Thank you!"

aww,"They were all hers, we knew she'd started laying eggs in a planter round the side of the building. Saw them all jumping out (heart in mouth moment) 

I've just read from a comment further up that they can lay over multiple days"
aww,"I would argue they didn't present this as theirs at all. You made that assumption and were wrong and now are butthurt about it. Instead, what OP did was make a funny title that set up the scene. They did not, in anyway, say ""This is MY dog looking guilty for stealing my eggs."""
aww,"Difficulty hearing and arthritis are normal in advanced age.  They don't automatically indicate agony.  The dog is standing in the posted photo.  If he was in agony, he wouldn't be able to stand.  Difficulty is not equivalent to inability.

FFS, I have difficulty standing and trouble hearing for genetic reasons.  I'm also in a lot more pain than this pup, for other genetic reasons.  Do I need to be put down?"
aww,Fluffy jelly beans of darkness :)  &lt;3
aww,Gonna get my cat a strawberry and green olive feast tonight üòÇ
aww,That beautiful tie distracts me from his deformity.
aww,"So, you are saying it's cheaper to buy chicken *than* cat food?

aww,"I kept saying stuff like, ""Keep going! You've got this!"" I didn't even realize I was doing it at first. 

There's just no way to watch it and not root for this little critter."
aww,This is great! Smart dogs are the best! I did something similar with teaching my dog hand signals for commands. Silent commands are handy. I also taught him to be prompted to look for a non-verbal command when he hears me snap my fingers.
aww,"If you want to feed something other than a feline diet, Talk. To. Your. Veterinarian. SERIOUSLY. There's a lot of harm that can be done when formulating your own diet. Please talk to someone qualified and get decent info before feeding your cat exclusively chicken hearts and thighs."

aww,Newsagents in a tourist spot at edge of loch!
aww,Sorry for the misunderstanding. He got the treatment 4.5 months ago. He walked for the first time 3 days ago. I'm not sure what the expectation is for the future. I'm hoping it keeps improving and we are able to build those muscles that are beginning to work again

aww,It makes me happy seeing him act so happy.
aww,"My boy-cat got stones and was put right back on a prescription dry food diet that he'll be on for the rest of his life, so hey! Maybe tell people to talk to their vet about their animal's dietary needs instead of making uninformed statements on reddit."
aww,"I think it's interesting that when we see behavior like this in other animals, we think ""It's cool that they exhibit such humanlike behavior."" Instead of acknowledging that it's really just animal behavior that we also engage in."
aww,"White and fluffy, just as I like my rice."
aww,Most likely. We don't really ask.
aww,me as a cat lol
aww,"It's not 80% garbage filler.  
It's 80% of stuff that's carefully studied and engineered by veterinarians and other scientists to provide a properly balanced diet to your pets. Don't confuse your google-fu with their hard-earned veterinary medical degrees and peer-reviewed research."
aww,"I'm not sure if this applies to cats,  but strawberries contain an enzyme that can help whiten your dog's teeth. However always give animals fruit in moderation to avoid tummy aches."
aww,It hurt my head.
aww,"üò≠ That‚Äôs an awful disease. I have an uncle with it, and he‚Äôs one of the rare ones to make it to his 50s (and he 100% relies on technology and other peoples help).

I am so happy for your son and all the progress he has made. I hope to see more updates from you in the future."
aww,"""Why you looking at me? Somebody stole your sweetroll?"""
aww,How well do these rehabilitated chimps thrive in the wild? Do they monitor them to make sure they are able to hunt and fend for themselves?
aww,Never been so proud of my ass
aww,"Currently, there is a ban on federal funding for creating new stem cell lines from embryos, iirc. Basically, over time a lot more stem cell research has become legal, but there is still red tape everywhere you look. There are far more rules and restrictions and bureaucracy in this sector than most other fields of science. Lack of funding and support from the government is seriously holding the technology back and delaying treatment for many people who could use it *now*"
aww,No need to neuter; did it himself. ;)
aww,It is natural for mammals to be playful.

I don‚Äôt like it when they say:  
‚ÄúOh! You scared me!‚Äù  
‚ÄúYES.‚Äù"
aww,Jane Goodall is such a boss. I can only hope her legacy is remembered in the way she deserves.
aww,"I'm not sure what you mean by maturity here but if you're saying they're not as able to become any cell type, I think that's more the point with these types of therapies. The fetal cells already started their decent down a specific cell pathway so they're not pluripotent unlike the skin cells that are reprogrammed to be pluripotent. I honestly know very little about this disease but most likely they don't want to inject a cell that can become anything and instead inject ones that have already started down a specific path that they harvest from the fetuses. I work with iPSCs too and I agree they're pretty amazing but it seems like in this case, the more differentiated cells were what they're going for."
aww,Awww. He loves you so much!

aww,"Pluto is a great name for a Dog, never even thought of it."
aww,But does she clean her butthole?
aww,"I totally know the issue‚ÄîI rescued a stray, so he wants to experience outdoors, but I refuse to let him run off alone because I also have coyotes in my area, and I‚Äôm petrified of him being run over by a car.

If you have the funds, it‚Äôs not *too* expensive to either have a ‚Äúcatio‚Äù made, or order a built one! 

I had my dad build me one in my backyard (free labor since my dad, but all wood and chicken wire cost around $100), but before that I was looking into rabbit hutches online. They are well made, cat can‚Äôt escape, predators can‚Äôt get in, and cat gets to enjoy sunshine, feeling of grass, and birdwatching! It has a little door that I can open, so I carry him outside to it, drop him in, and lock it behind him. When he‚Äôs ready to come back in, he just sits by the catio door!"
aww,Oh my god I didn‚Äôt know how badly I needed an alpaca in my car until this very moment üòÇ

aww,Amazing.  I can't even imagine.  Thank you for the answers and I hope the healing continues.
aww,"Watch out with dry food, it can be high in carbs.  I had a cat get diabetes probably from all the dry food.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Why the downvote?  My vet emphasized getting low carbs for this reason."
aww,It's mostly a mix of breeds.
aww,Wow! You made that maze in 2 minutes and 20 seconds.
aww,I wonder how it must taste since cats can't taste sweetness
aww,"Also hamsters have weird little bodies (especially Syrians like this one) that don't really bend like rats. They love climbing but they're such little potatoes with legs so far apart it can be hard.

aww,"You get &gt;30 minutes in the car until they freak out because they have to pee. Then they pee. Everywhere. Fortunately they make waterproof covers for backseats, but it‚Äôs not a fun drive after that bit. Otherwise it‚Äôs pretty cute."

aww,My daughter has started texting me good morning and goodnight.  She lives with her mom but we see each other multiple times a week plus our visitation days.  It just makes me feel important and makes my day better when she takes the time in the morning to tell me to have a good day at work.

aww,"They need stuff like taurine, which you can get by adding chicken hearts. Most of the other additives in cheap canned food is nonsense filler. I also keep cat grass growing in the house which they love to chew on (basically just oat grass). A varied diet is always good. I feed my cats fresh fish pretty often too.

Some people in this thread are saying they need even more, and I'm not an expert, so feel free to supplement with quality canned food from time to time, keeping in mind that the expensive stuff usually has less stuff in it than the cheap stuff, because most of the crap in cheap cat food is filler."

That money goes to medical research for a cure as well as doctors visits, medical equipment such as wheelchairs and braces, home renovations need to accommodate such, and allowing local kids afflicted with MD to go to summer camp.

Anyways, they make food for her which is some kind of chicken paste and it must be good because the other cats go apeshit when its her feeding time. They have to corral the other cats in another room while the toothless cat eats and then the other cats can eat once toothless is done. If there are any scraps left that toothless hasn't eaten the other cats fight for it."
aww,All my cats try to get in the window like that üòÇ they are special. One of them literally meows in disagreement when you tell him not to do something its absolutely hilarious
aww,Unrelated to the dog but the k**chunkk** of that gate unlatching was a *really* satisfying sound.
aww,I had a cat once that loved watermelon. Like you could cut up pieces on a bowl and he‚Äôd eat it up. Our vet told us cats don‚Äôt taste sweet- they have sweet taste buds but they‚Äôre super weak. She said cats are desert animals and guessed it was the water contact Obie really liked.
aww,"My buddies Maine coon doesn't mind can food, it's all that he eats now that he is in his 20s. We were actually talking about it the other day, we aren't sure if he is 22 or 23. But back 5+ years ago he would supplement his canned food diet with cottontail rabbits. It was not uncommon to see him by the front door munching on one."
aww,"In dog years, he hasn't walked with you in 56 years. He missed this."
aww,Damn the cat even did the dishes
aww,That's really weird. I don't think cats even have taste receptors for sweet.
aww,"Where do you live? chicken breast is 1.99/lb on sale here. Sometimes there is a deeper sale for 1.49/lb. My cats want meat they can catch it themselves, plenty of mice in the fields"
aww,I had the biggest Fucking smile on my face the whole time!  Well done!
aww,That's what happens when you snortcokeeveryday
aww,Ha. That is interesting. I never fully realised before I do this aswell. I always notice (and point out to others) something from us in them but never the other way around.
aww,The fact that even older dogs can still prance and get this excited over a walk shows just how much they love walks and how important they are. Everyone should take their dogs on more walks.
aww,But it sounds halarious so there is that
aww,"My dog is 6,5 kilos and still manages to sprawl out over his half and some of my half of a huge bed."
aww,MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH
aww,"Yup, and then you have to worry about spoilage, contamination, etc. (to a much greater degree than cat food)

You also gotta go through the process of getting it more often.

This is a stupid recommendation for the majority of pet owners."
aww,You guys are udderly ridiculous!
aww,My cat is obsessed with eating succulent plants like an absolute fucktard.
aww,"Always check the products you're buying for palm oil! 

Don't buy if there's palm oil or palminate. Biggest threat to these creatures. 

You can also lobby your local politicians to ban it, as they did in Norway."
aww,Man I love Wegmans. Sometimes I‚Äôll go just to get a sandwich.
aww,I‚Äôm probably the only one who thinks this looks fake/cgi. The shake seems to be artificial
aww,Yeah I believe they replaced truffle hunting pigs with dogs too
aww,"My cat would be hanging on to the shreds of my skin by her nails if I tried to bathe her. I know this because I attempted this when she was a kitten, and I still have a slight claw scar on my chest."
aww,Yeah the hard part is training them not to eat it.
aww,I think the cardboard is irritating his face. Poor guy.
aww,You should give him a little red cap with two big eyes on the front of the cap for the next video.
aww,Where do you live that your house backyard has a bigger backyard..
aww,How could it not after that.üíï
aww,"He's lovely but you need to help him lose some weight for his health, he's very overweight."
aww,"The choice is yours, and yours alone!"
aww,"Maybe you could use some clay to press into the imprint, using it as a sort of mold, and then pull it out and let it dry a bit and then make a print from the clay?"
aww,This needs to be a Rubic's cube moasic.
aww,What‚Äôs this water coming out of my eyes????
aww,"We do this for clients! I work at an animal hospital and we use an ink pad and stamp their animals paw print into some nice special paper. We all sign the back, write the animals name on it, and then send it off to their home. We also make decorative vials of their animals hair if they ask."

aww,"The cat probably saw her, but the cat was out there drinking."
aww,We love you stem cells!!!
aww,"Lol. I've gotten like 50 responses here about giving him CBD. Unfortunately CBD seems to make his legs even less functional. He has degenerative myelopathy which causes him to lose function of his back legs more over time. When I give him CBD or cannabis, he can't walk. Keeping him mobile helps slow down the progression of the disease. So although I'd love to sedate him and let him sleep all day, it isn't the best thing for him :("
aww,I had a hamster several years ago (Sparky). Quite the escape artist. He once got out of his cage on the second floor and somehow ended up emerging from a closet on the first floor. Sweet little guy.
aww,My male cat does the same thing...just drools all over when he is being petted.
aww,Sounds like a video game door unlock.
aww,That's a really important fact that a lot of people might not realise. We're just animals with over complicated brains.
aww,**THIS** is real life magic
aww,He is clearly cheating looking over the walls lol.
aww,I'm crying. These things actually makes me realize that my dog will eventually grow old and leave me - I haven't accepted this yet. I love my dog way too much that I don't think I can let him go.
aww,It's just shaking off the tics

aww,They sell some decent brands at petco and other pet stores but you end up paying like 8x as much as you would if you made it yourself.
aww,Thought I was on r/greatpyrenees for a sec
aww,He‚Äôs doing awesome for his age. Nice to see him so happy
aww,He looks exactly like Robert Duvall in dog form
aww,Isn‚Äôt it wonderful to be loved like that?!
aww,"I love her.

When I was a kid, she made me believe chimpanzees were the best primate ever, kinda like in a Disney movie. It was later on that I learned chimpanzees are actually major assholes, and bonobos are the true bros, but I still love Jane.

Her and Steve Irwin, man. They marked my childhood."
aww,Where is Mexico again?
aww,caught u yellow handed
aww,You should hear her when she eats watermelon
aww,I would eat you
aww,Yeah I kinda figured that as well. Nothing like getting your face ripped off amiright?
aww,"I love getting these kinds of notes from my kids! It‚Äôs a double bonus too because not only did you get a beautiful note, you know you‚Äôre raising her right. What a beautiful empathetic soul your daughter has."
aww,My cat despises all human food except cheese. He literally gags at everything else lol
aww,Its a whole seal
aww,That actually sounds like a really good idea!  Thanks for the suggestion!

You know that they really mean it.
Well as long as you feed them."
aww,"This.

Random morons on the internet are not medical professionals.

Don't just start feeding your cat raw chicken because some random clown says to with a random link."
aww,I was worried the little critter wouldn't get a treat at the end. I'm relieved.
aww,Luckily they haven't taken up raiding the bins out the back as well
aww,Happy to help :)
aww,"each level descended = land on face

i have to go watch this again"
aww,I got called a bunch of terrible names from a former friend when I told him he might be more accepting of stem cell therapy if one of his kids needed it.
aww,Awww my heart.  Amazing
aww,"I used to have a dog that looked just like that.. long time ago..

Oh I do miss him"
aww,He‚Äôs the guy wearing the hat. He‚Äôs always the guy wearing the hat.

aww,My former cat loved elastic hairbands. Didn't know until he was at the vets office getting neutered and he barfed. üòïü§î
aww,Ok that's a bit funny
aww,Costco has chicken thighs on sale for .99/lb.
aww,I see why you use the fork.
aww,"Arrested (to stop short).

 Or stolen.

 In this case they both still mean chopped."
aww,"Well, mostly because a lot of the time, we're just engaging in anthropomorphism and it's not at all what we think.

It's fun to pretend though."
aww,"No, I walk on all fours -- especially after three martinis."
aww,This. I have a Boston and he‚Äôs the best but the snoring and farts are horrific. He also gets bundled up in blankets tho
aww,Don't tell me how to @!
aww,When I was  young this is what I imagined scientists did when I heard the term animal testing.
aww,"I understand some people value their time more than money, and that's fine, but it really doesn't take much effort. I buy a package of chicken thighs and hearts at the same time as my normal groceries so it's not taking any extra time, I throw it in a pan and cook it, let it cool, mince it up, and then I put it in containers. I basically prep enough for a week at a time and it maybe takes 20 minutes out of my week. 

It's fun for me though, if you dont like cooking then maybe it's a bigger waste of time for you.

I also cook the same chicken for myself so I am basically cooking for myself and my cats at the same time."
aww,"Do you know if an adult could still benefit as much, or is your son benefiting from his age? I know it will advance, but I'm just hoping this person will be able to choose for themselves someday and get the benefits stem cells have to offer."

aww,How did they survive this long?
aww,Cockatoos are big sucks!!
aww,"Same with this one üòÇ His names toast, and I have to check up on his cage every morning. I'm currently in the process of building a cage too, hopefully that will stop him!"
aww,He is so happy. My yellow lab Maddie had problems after anal gland cancer removal. I used to have to wipe her bum after she did her business. I did it full of love for her and we made a game about it and it was no problem for her either. I miss her so much
aww,Make sure to peel your apple as well. The skin is riddled with toxins!

aww,That‚Äôs weird mine fucking hates them. He makes a weird face and runs away
aww,That would be so uncomfortable to sleep in
aww,Thank you!! He‚Äôs 1 year now :)
aww,It‚Äôs a very big trap!
aww,"Why?  There's no food in the maze.  He's just exploring.  In zoos, they call them ""enrichment activities."""
aww,Must be from SoCal because 68 is cold and where I would like my room for sleep if not 66.
aww,"I know those back legs. When they hop together like that the dog is really trying to to use them. If you can afford it, you should go to the vet and get some x-rays for arthritis. You may be able to get some medicine for that. 

It extended my dog's agility for 3 extra years and really eased her old age pain."
aww,We don't deserve them!
aww,"one of my clients has one.  Every single time he gets on a conference call, the bird loses his shit in the background.  ""Mitch is on""."
aww,"I live in Maine. Chicken breast is expensive here too, but the cheaper cuts of meat are actually much healthier for your cats. The fattier the better. 99 cents for thighs, sometimes as low as 49 cents if you go to the discount store down the street."
aww,and cheated by looking over the walls
aww,My cat won't go to bed unless she's had two treats-broken up. You can't try and rip her off with one broken up into smaller pieces-she just *knows*
aww,"Good luck with that! We went through several cages and finally had one we thought was escape proof. It was not. I was always afraid he'd get stuck somewhere in a wall while exploring, but he didn't. They are very sweet little pets."
aww,My dog just crawls under the covers and curls up with his back against my stomach. He loves to be a little spoon.
aww,You are and always will be a giant in your daughter‚Äôs eyes.

aww,So....we have the thicc primate asses?
aww,Didn't anyone notice the two orbs going whizzing by during the kid's victory lap around the room?...
aww,My son will give me a hug and tell me he loves me when I have a bad day. Makes the day instantly better.
aww,hope they live a long happy life together!!
aww,I wish we had those prices. 1.99 IS our cheap prices. Ill have to look but 2.99+/lb is the norm here. Even 70/30 ground is 2.49/lb on a good day.
aww,The zoom ins are hilarious and cute üíÄ
aww,He looks like Doby when he eats that
aww,"You need to add chicken hearts or other organs for taurine. A cat could live 100% off chicken this way but it's always better to have a varied diet. I also feed my cats fish, they have cat grass to chew on, and I usually have a small bowl of dry food out, though they barely touch it now that they are used to chicken."
aww,"So cute! A talkative baby for sure.

Also is this the Netherlands? Just asking cause the ground (cobblestones) looks familiar."
aww,First glance I thought it was a snake and not a cast.
aww,Also kinda racist that he only hugged the two white women......../s
aww,Love it. And looks like a beautiful home too
aww,Such a sweet moment
aww,I dont know how the dog doesnt black out from heat stroke
aww,"Quickly, buy him a full-size trampoline and report back with more videos!"
aww,Best doggo to have ever lived
aww,I am shocked how cheap chicken is in the states. You can only achieve these prices by keeping them in the most abhorrent conditions possible.
aww,What a dapper woofer! :)
aww,Sounds like a westie that's for sure!
aww,"Imma keep it straight with you, I thought it said fucked"
aww,"I hope so. She's getting so big now, I just look at her and am truly amazed just how wonderful she's becoming."
aww,:D People are so serious. It was a joke. I keep my thermostat set to 64 at night.
aww,You have good beef prices though. Ground beef is $4.99 at the cheapest here.
aww,"If somebody came to your house, scooped you up (more accurately tranqed you) while blabbering gibberish at you, and then took you to a new house, you‚Äôd be alarmed.

aww,"Yep, the pigs ate too many truffles lol...."
aww,A table that MOOOOOves
aww,His eyes when he finally gets his treat!
aww,NOOOOOO DO NOT DO THAT TO US

aww,I love this but it's 6 levels.

aww,He‚Äôs probably holding back tears
aww,"Munchkin cat.

Deliberate breeding of a ""normal"" cat and basically a dwarf cat.

Horrible way to do this. Not much different than what the AKC has done to many dog bread by breading them into congenital defects, joint, respiratory, etc. problems. 

IMHO, photos of these should be banned from /r/cats because people think they are ""cute"". They live a life of pain.

aww,"Raw chicken reduces by around 25% when you cook it. To end up with 1 lb. of cooked chicken, you need to buy 1.33 lbs, which would cost $1.31. Then you have to spend the time and energy cooking it, and the utility cost of cooking and cleaning your dishes afterwards with soap and water.

I get the appeal because it's better quality, when you consider the total cost, it's not cheaper."
aww,Maybe you are having problems preloading the textures

aww,"Hi
A few weeks ago, i saw my ex gf 
She invited me to dinner with this man.. part of cousteau working crew..
Had some crazy stories like when their shark cage opened up while in the water and shark came in (told me they were not worried to get bit but careful because their skin can cut you easily..)
Or the time they found a kind of iceberg with a hole in it
They went in and with the air released from their oxygen tank it started to shift until being upside down, he told me they almost died on this one

aww,"As the cutest dog I've ever seen, she deserves to stay out a bit longer. What a good girl!"
aww,"Ahh, I thought that was the videographer's leg as I was watching this late at night xD"
aww,I tried to feed mine one the other day she wasn't having it
aww,Thank you. My heart is filled with joy because of her.
aww,I knew there was a missing fossil for my Pokemon blue save
aww,"Shut your mouth, he‚Äôs an angel"
aww,"When you consider that most canned food is just the absolute garbage waste parts of the chicken no human would ever eat, it's way cheaper to buy real chicken.

The first ingredient in most cat food is, ""Meat By-products,"" The second ingredient is water, and the third is usually some sort of cheap grain."
aww,I found dog ice cream at my local grocery store and the pup loves it so much. I think Napoleon needs his own little doggie ice creams.
aww,I keep the ones my son used to leave me (he's 13 now and I don't get the sweet notes anymore) on my bathroom mirror so I see them every morning and every night before bed. I can honestly tell you that there were mornings when the only motivation I had to keep going were those sweet little post it notes from my beautiful boy.
aww,Definitely started my day on the right foot this morning. :)
aww,Clearly cheating on lv3 !!
aww,"&gt;Of course if you stop providing the dry food your cat will definitely start eating the chicken.

My cat would definitely disagree.  When she was spayed, the vet discovered she was born with only one kidney.  I tried to cut her off from dry and only feed her wet so she would get more water.  She absolutely would not eat wet food if she couldn't have dry first.  If I tried to sprinkle a couple kibbles on top of wet, she'd eat the kibbles off with a tiny bit of wet food and then stop.  Mixing it didn't work at all.  I did try to give her fresh chicken too and she was completely uninterested.  If she didn't get enough dry she'd just chew on plastic (grocery bags, random stuff she'd pull out of the garbage, etc.) and vomit bile and saliva when her stomach was empty.

So she gets her dry food.  Fortunately she drinks a good amount of water so she doesn't have too many problems."
aww,"yah, my cats eat IAMS dry food the majority of the time. i give them chicken scraps every day or two, and they get a can of wet food split 3 ways once or twice a week, just to mix things up."
aww,This is so cool!
aww,"thats exactly what i dont understand, if they are being aborted why not put that life to good use? its like miracle cells. theres just no reason to argue against it other than nutters who think we‚Äôre gonna harvest babies in the future or something lmao"

aww,"my kitten does some of these things too, he was also abandoned by his mom and was extremely sickly when i found him. he's never kneaded anything in his life, he's also a big fan of jumping on things by ""lion kinging"" them as i call it that your cat does too. jumps straight up and then pulls himself up with his upper body. although i'm not sure if that's just because he has poor depth perception maybe or he just straight up doesn't know how to leap."
aww,"Cats, as they grow into adults, tend to find one texture and obsess over it.  This is likely what's happening here."

aww,"Do you think the 4 research students she let get kidnapped by Tanzanian rebel soldiers reacted the same way when their families privately funded the ransom that Goodall and her university refused to fund?

Edit to add details for the curious: Jane was tipped off that rebel soldiers were approaching her research station by a security guard and left. She literally dipped out and hid in the jungle. She abandoned 4 college aged students behind, who were held captive for weeks. All parties accountable for their safety (Jane, the university, the US government) refused to raise funding for their ransom because it would ‚Äòaid a war criminal.‚Äô 

Her facility is still abandoned to this day, you can still see the iron barred cages where her precious ‚Äòwild‚Äô primates were held and studied for weeks at a time."

aww,Jamie - pull up that picture of the hairless chimp with gigantic balls.
aww,"Please do this op. We became really worried about my dog when she was about 13, thought she was on her last legs. We went to the vet who told us to restrict her diet til she lost 10lbs. It completely changed her from spending all day sleeping and panting to a much more comfortable life. She ended up living to 17 and was so happy/loved for those 4 years."

aww,"Don't literally give them a feast of this stuff.  They'll have an upset stomach if they eat a decent amount.  Cats aren't generally used to processing fruits and veggies, strawberries ARE **non-toxic** so they are safe to feed... But do so in moderation unless you want diarrhea everywhere."
aww,"Oh man.... this gave me the feels....

Cherish this"
aww,"Honestly those safety harnesses are rubbish. My sister had a whippet pup who was getting neutered but one of the testicle hadn't descended so they had to cut him open and obviously stitch the wound. The dog was out of sight for a matter of minutes and my sister came back into the kitchen to find blood everywhere. The pup had chewed through the harness, opened his stitches and started to eat his intestines. 
Please be really vigilant if your dog is getting through those harnesses, I honestly believe if he had had one of those old school safety collars he would still be around today even though they look pretty uncomfortable."

aww,Should‚Äôve already been a crack there man it just showed up now?
aww,"What about the Stockholm syndrome? Or something like that. Look at us. Imagine that you would get stranded on an island with few other people for few years. Eventually you would form friendships, probably even have a lover that you would otherwise consider totally unattractive in the normal society with millions of choices, and these folks would eventually become your tribe and replace all the previous relationships you had. Of course you would still remember the old ones, but the new ones would be in the present time and more let's say alive than the past memories. The question is how would this work with the apes and people that spend a lot of time together."

aww,"You won't find much legit non pop-science news from American sources and American research articles are almost non existent for obvious reasons.

But there is plenty of research you can find that has been done in parts of Europe, China, and Latin America.

China alone has been making leaps and bounds... and after all the initial religious backlash and denials, European and Latin American labs normally manage to confirm/replicate their findings within a few years after the work is initially published."

aww,"What are we supposed to do, live underground?  People are not oblivious to this problem: case in point is at the root of this conversation.  The kid nurtured the dazed bird, the bird ""flew away into the sky"" and the kid will remember it forever.  How is that oblivious?  In fact, if you read all the other comments you will see that people are not oblivious, many are nuts about birds.  Would you have us sit around wringing our hands about birds crashing into our windows once in awhile (at 76 this has happened to me about a dozen times, mostly mourning doves) while climate change obliterates species by the hundred every year?  Thousands of birds crash into high rises every day all over the world, countless more will be butchered by wind and wave turbines if homo sapiens even survives fossil fuel energy into the future.  A single child loving a single dazed finch is just a sweet thing, whether or not the finch suffers neurological damage. You missed altogether the point of those few kind, encouraging words I spoke to the kid."
aww,Thank you! I love her with all my heart!!

aww,"&gt; [Heikegani were used by Carl Sagan in his popular science television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage as an example of unintentional artificial selection,[3] an interpretation published by Julian Huxley in 1952.[4] According to this hypothesis, the crabs with shells resembling samurai were thrown back to the sea by fishermen out of respect for the Heike warriors, while those not resembling samurai were eaten, giving the former a greater chance of reproducing. Thus, the more closely the crabs resembled a samurai face, the more likely they would be spared and thrown back.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikegani)

&gt; [This idea has met with some skepticism, as noted by Joel W. Martin. He posits that humans don't use heikegani for food, and as such there is no artificial pressure favoring face-like shell patterns, contrary to Sagan's implication.[4] The pattern of ridges on the carapace serves a very functional purpose as sites of muscle attachment. Similar patterns are found on the carapaces of other species and genera throughout the world, including numerous fossil taxa.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heikegani)

Links are to the same place.

I'd say Sagan's hypothesis is a guess. If it's true that Heikegani were not usually eaten, then perhaps it's luck they look this way. But IMO the fact that the ridges are functional doesn't exclude that the shape and form was influenced. If short &amp; wide shouldered humans had superior breeding chances we'd turn into dwarves and the shoulder's would still be functional parts of the body. Now if thick beards started developing on all men and women, that's more aesthetic selection."

aww,"wait, you bought your dog a trampoline? That's epic."
aww,"Absolutely. It's why they sell those plastic tubes for hamsters. They love exploring tunnels and narrow corridors. Same goes for pretty much any rodent. 

I had a large hamster cage when I was younger. It was actually two cages combined into one with several tube lines connecting them together. My hamster would make the circuit around most of the setup at least once a night. They travel quite large distances(relative to their size) at night in the wild. So, in addition to running on his wheel off an on all night, my hamster would lap around the whole cage too. 

They have absurd amounts of energy at night. Mazes and tubes are great ways to help burn that energy off."

aww,"lol the cats body saying yes, but it‚Äôs eyes are like I can‚Äôt wait for this to be over.

It‚Äôs always funny how often cats tolerate humans hugging them even when they show clear signs they are not enjoying it. A few cats actually snuggle you and do seem to enjoy it, but most just have a look of disdain or discomfort on their face. 

They just wait for their human to get the hugs out of their system, so they can get back to their important duties. Which is usually sitting in the most central location of whatever you‚Äôre doing... like your keyboard."

aww,Her immune system has probably tanked from the stress of being gone from home for so long. My dog died a few months after I got him back so you'll want to take some precautions so that doesn't happen to your cat.

aww,"Dogs have been essentially genetically modified over thousands of years to desire human companionship, we bred out a lot of their prey drive and independence to make them more manageable companions. 

Wild primates, which is what we‚Äôre talking about, not zoo animals, will not form an attachment like a dog. Ever."

aww,Is that the chimp‚Äôs butthole?
aww,Haha no. It was just wooden flooring we had in the house at the time

aww,Three blankets?  Do you live in an igloo?
aww,Oh what a sweet baby he was so excited
aww,"I often gaze at my pets while reliving their babyhoods.  I've wondered if people who raise German Shepherds gaze at their beautiful, majestic, dignified dogs and recollect fondly their Absurd Ear Phase, when they also had enormous feets and were prone to run smack into things.

aww,My anaconda don't want none less you a chimp son.
aww,"Poor cat! Munchkin breeding is torture ! These animals have a lot of difficulties to do natural things, like sitting straight.

They suffer so that people find them ‚Äúcute‚Äù and pay a fortune to have one of them."

aww,Yeah I‚Äôd like to know what that green stuff is too?

aww,"Yeah, I can see the similarities...."
aww,"Warmed my heart. Jane Goodall was the only person to ever be ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù into a community of chimps. If you were a chimp, what a treat to have Jane on your side"
aww,"My cat was adopted as a bottle baby, and she doesn‚Äôt know how to clean herself at all. I swear it‚Äôs because she was never taught by mama kitty."
aww,Gah! Bit in her mouth*
aww,Tell me your joking.....
aww,Joke is on her! It won't
aww,I would too!  That was a really long maze.
aww,"Am I the only one who recognized a chimpy  'kiss my ass' as it presented it's rear to the brunette and then to Jane (putting it at her eye level) before finally turning back for a what looked to be to be a well trained hug? I noticed Jane responded with all deliberate caution! As much as I love Ms. Goodall, I take this as a total PR stunt based on her body language (and position of the men of the  ""team"" when the camera switches from two separate angles...)   Anyone notice the chimps look for approval at 38:92 and then Jane's eye contact with the camera?   Yeah, this was obviously staged and they did a fine job editing it."
aww,German words for things never fail to please the soul.
aww,The guy at the back on the right is not having any of it.
aww,"I worked for a landscape company and the owner always wanted alpacas, so when he bought land for a new office he got a herd of them. Darwin was born prematurely and his mother wouldn‚Äôt feed him, and conveniently everyone else was out of town so it was my job to figure out how to take care of a rejected baby alpaca (I also worked closely with the goats and chickens on property). It‚Äôs very rare for alpacas to reject their young, so there wasn‚Äôt a lot of info out there on how to take care of him, but I worked with our breeder and we figured out a good milk recipe for him and it worked out. He would spend all day with his herd out at the office and then come home with me at night so he could be bottle fed every 2-4 hours. We set up a pen in my living room and I slept on the couch for a while. Then we‚Äôd drive 30 minutes back out to the ranch and start the process all over."

aww,"I work at a vet and we have t shirts we put on dogs who have large stitches on their sides or stomach.  They‚Äôre all t shirts from my vet‚Äôs motorcycle husband, so like Harley Davidson shirts, etc. It‚Äôs hilarious to have a doggie bike gang in the clinic."

Edit: Thank you stranger for my first silver!"
aww,"Never knew he was a cat person. Black cats are the best my wife &amp; I have found. We've always had two at a time &amp; it's always been the black ones that were the most trainable. Stayed in the back yard with us while gardening or relaxing, always come when called from the yard. And generally more cuddly. We always had a great deal of luck treating them just like a dog which we also always have. They learn from each other. Enjoy Rob."
aww,A NEW AMERICAN HAMSTER WARRIOR WORLD RECORD!!!
aww,"Dogs always remember who their first owner was.  Years and years ago, my brother and his wife got a toy poodle.  They kept her for a few months before realizing that no matter how much they wanted to, keeping a dog just wasn't compatible with their lives at the time.  (They lived in a small-ish apartment and worked long hours) so they eventually gave her to me.  I was in middle school at the time, and my sister was still living at home while at Uni, so she ended up bonding with the dog way more than I could, so it pretty much just became her dog.  

Until the day she died, that dog always got excited whenever she saw my Brother."
aww,"Now this is awesome

Jane Goodall is a national hero and deserves all the recognition in the world for the work she has done to help these precious animals"

aww,That is amazing! What a wonderful heart you have to do that for him.
aww,"We haven't been reshaping chimp's minds to help us hunt for millenia.

We made dogs depend on us for food, so much so that they will fall off a cliff while hunting deer with us if they have to. Chimps are smarter than that."

aww,These dogs are the best!!
aww,"Poor kid, that sounds awful. Yeah, I've been washing my hands. I haven't handled him much though, to be honest. I'm waiting until I can get into the vet to give him the all-clear just because I'm weary since he was outside"
aww,"my father passed away recently and he was an organ donor, and among other things what stands out to me is that based on mailings/gifts I‚Äôve received, someone else is walking around able to see with/because of his eyes"

aww,"My other cat does the exact same thing to me! If I'm not laying on my side, she'll tap me with her paws, meow in my face, bite me, or poke my bladder until I roll over so she can cuddle up next to my belly. It's equal parts cute and irritating. If I kick her out of the room, she'll sit in the hall and perform cat opera."
aww,Does anyone get real umfottabke when living things are in appliances. I don't find it cute at all. I just think of that kid that gave his little brother a wash.... Just no.
aww,Would you mind sharing the breeder and how much you paid privately?
aww,I didn't know who Jacques Cousteau was until I Googled it just now.
aww,"My former cat loved sweets.  Cake, cookies, pie, she loved it all."
aww,"Jane Goodall is.. well she‚Äôs just so great. I hope she lives a long, wonderful, happy life"
aww,Isn‚Äôt that where a good deal of the fibre is though? I wash all my fruit with a diluted vinegar mixture to remove wax and pesticides.
aww,My neighbor has the same dog with arthritis. It just chills in the front yard all day and people watches night and day only coming in when they leave. Seeing it struggle to walk to find a spot to shit can be hard on the feels.
aww,How does she create such a strong bond with apes?
aww,"With my two, one takes my right side, the other my left. On the left side, she *must* go under the blankets, where she nuzzles either under my arm or by my knees. On the right, he will *not* go under the blanket but will sit by my head, facing out to the door. If one doesn't sleep, neither do and (sic) nor do I."
aww,Strawberries are just an ovary. Lol

aww,Such a sweet smile
aww,May I please come over?
aww,"After I had a bad day and got upset with them over some little thing one of my kids put a sticky note on the mirror that says ""Have a nice day!"" surrounded by a bunch of smiley faces. It's kind of in the way, but so far it has been up for a month and I can't bring myself to remove it."
aww,"Or maybe he rewarded the hamster for each level in training and inbetween for staying in maize...

&amp;#x200B;

In fact there are some cut scenes where he seems to be nibbling on something.

&amp;#x200B;

If anything the hamster seems food driven."
aww,"Yeah, don't pick up baby rabbits they will likely die in a couple of hours."
aww,"Yes, there are many things killing birds, and they should all be addressed. In the case of windows, decals can be applied, or special windows can be used for new development. Most people are certainly oblivious, as birds drop to the ground around them in downtown, and they pay no attention to it. They look at the Lights Out volunteers like we're nuts, as we run around netting the birds. Rather than wring your hands about it, I'd suggest volunteering to help out with the problem. There's not much I personally can do about climate change or wind mills. But I can easily help rescue birds, and put decals on my windows."
aww,"That is a ‚Äòget out of jail free‚Äô card for any future bad day ever!

aww,Don‚Äôt get hurt buddy! Lol
aww,"Just wondering, does the cat actually eat the strawberry?"
aww,"He looks SO much like my Nibble, who is also most affectionate at bedtime. Gets to 10pm and he marches up and down the bed, miaowing, headbutting us, diving under the pillows, and finally, scratching his head against my Nintendo DS so I know it's time to put it away.
When morning comes, he ignores us."
aww,"I love that you added, ‚Äúso far‚Äù to your comment. So wholesome to see such optimism these days."

aww,"Holy shit ... 99 cents a pound...

I‚Äôm in BC, Canada so that is ridiculously cheap even when converted to Cannabux!"
aww,No. That is not rice. Please. Don‚Äôt eat. Not. Rice. Thank you.
aww,It's Superman's best friend.
aww,"Pls don't actually do this unless you have proper guidance from a vet who is specially trained in cat nutrition.

The best thing to do is read ingredients and research what you're buying. The main ingredients to avoid (or to have further down the list, preferably after any protein and supplements) are brewers rice, corn and any type of 'meal' ie chicken meal. Also pay attention to the nutritional information. Good cat food have a high caloric content and high amount of protein. Most house cats are actually being overfed but under nourished due to the quality of cheap pet food, so they feel a lot hungrier more often."
aww,You can soak her dry food in water.

aww,"In rats, the somatosensory cortex that relates to the whiskers is called the Barrel cortex. It is a useful structure to study the functioning of neural processing, as individual whiskers use such a large portion of the cortex that electrodes can easily be inserted. The whiskers are mapped on the cortex in the same arrangement as on the face.

As rats rely so heavily on the input from their whiskers, you can essentially remote control a rat by stimulating individual areas in the barrel cortex."
aww,Wake up every morning with them on my face üòã

aww,"It's super easy to do your own research. People have been raising cats for thousands of years, you dont need to consult a vet and in my experience a vet is just going to give you some horseshit line and then try to sell you a $60 bag of some brand you have never heard of."
aww,Only chicken is NOT a good diet for your cat.
aww,He's gonna Wreck It!
aww,The video with sound is much better
aww,How are any of you seeing anything *other* than a bird?
aww,"Maybe if you‚Äôre feeding cleaned chicken - but if you‚Äôre feeding whole chickens, with organs, that provides everything cat needs nutritionally."
aww,Never lose that piece of paper. You will cherish it forever. I lost my daughter due to me being an alcoholic. I would give a week of my life just to have a 5 minute conversation on the phone about nothing particular....
aww,This is beautiful and made me tear up. Jane Goodall is an amazing human.
aww,It was a show of trust. Long story short.
aww,"currently yes, i can‚Äôt remember if this was sometime in 8th grade or freshman year when i was really going through a really awkward phase. Lol"
aww,Maybe you‚Äôre not cooking it right?  Try some garlic and a nice white wine sauce.
aww,0/10 OP didnt kiss his tiny little forehead good night
aww,Such a good boy.
aww,"‚ÄúHuman, look at my fresh Dorito beans‚Äù"
aww,people are amazing üòâ
aww,I thought it was a chocolate covered strawberry from the thumbnail.
aww,How‚Äôd the meeting go?
aww,Just call her Grace.
aww,I would love to play *soccer* with you
aww,"I'm totally not crying. No, not crying.


I'm so happy for your family!"

aww,"Lacks seasoning, its to sweet."
aww,Haha this was my thought too
aww,Although he‚Äôs cute my family and I are working on training him because we know from experience how difficult dogs can be if brought up improperly. I‚Äôm just enjoying this cute puppy time :)
aww,Thats a huge misconception pushed by pet food companies. Saying dry food will clean a pet's teeth is like saying eating crackers clean human's teeth. Only meaty bones will allow pets to sink their teeth in and the build up to be scraped off through friction.
aww,Does anybody have any actual studies showing this one way or another? I guess I'd trust a handful of vets over random owners but it seems like everything is anecdotal.
aww,"That calf is so confused by being in a car. It's so cute. 

Is she a Jersey?"
aww,Glucosamine in his food will help his hips a lot. Labs hips are notoriously bad and you can tell his are going out pretty easily by his stumbling and how hard he works up to his jumps. He also runs keeping his back legs together where a healthy dog will have them moving in more separate motions when at a trot or slower run. Even in older dogs giving this supplement can improve their quality of life by a great deal. Adorable doggie!
aww,"This is wholesome, I feel warm inside."
aww,Bring that video up Jamie
aww,I was hoping it would turn into a dungeon crawl with orcs and oozes and skeletons and such. Still very good!
aww,Can you suggest which book you are referring to?
aww,My house is 58-60 at night and has been my whole life. 64 tops in the daytime. It's all my mom everyone else is cold.
aww,I hope you don‚Äôt come to regret that remark!  üòÄ
aww,This just broke my heart the way he's saying goodbye and thanking them üò• where he belongs but I would be so hurt to let him go.

aww,"well, my eyes are wet now. can't wait to get home and hug my pup."
aww,"My dog would too, if she could concentrate long enough to keep a scent and walk more than 5 feet without being distracted"
aww,Damn dude I was happy sad and now I'm just sad sad.
aww,"Am an evolutionary biologist - more or less right.  You reorient the posture and bones and muscles are gonna end up shaped a bit differently.   

Not for nothing but I and others believe that the whole 'run long distances' thing is probably a bit oversold.  Cover more range, sure, but the notion that we evolved as cursorial predators is far from clear."
aww,No nose who cares hes/she still adorable as hell X
aww,Reminds me of how I pack down the trash can
aww,"He was 16, really close to 17, but he loved being outside (inside/mostly outside cat) so we considered that really good. :)"

aww,"It's an Austin Powers quote. 

Okay, sure Jan."
aww,"hah, I can't get ours off the bed, bostons LOVE being under cover!

the farts though, what a genetic jackpot."
aww,Honestly I would set mine that low if the rest o f the house wouldn't cry.  When I lived alone I left the heat off as long as possible and it was not unheard of to wake up to 57 degrees.
aww,I'm so daft.... I was scrolling by it for the 3rd time when I finally got the title. Well done lol.
aww,"*sees title and gif thumbnail*

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be a cat.‚Äù

Yep."
aww,Have to admit this is pretty cool!!
aww,Those walks are probably his favorite memory.
aww,"They are mushrooms that can't be farmed and are apparently absolutely amazing.  I haven't had one myself, but I read a book that described them and followed some Morel hunters and I want them so bad now."

aww,*Slams kitten into bin
aww,"Besides what has already been mentioned, our gluteus maximus compensates for the lack of a tail in regards to balance.  Rather than have a counter balance weight, we balance on one or two limbs with sheer muscle power."

aww,"I did a report about her in elementary school. When I had to present it, the teacher asked me something about her that was like, a current event. It blew my mind because I'd been operating under the assumption she was dead. 

I felt really dumb."
aww,"This is gorgeous. My next tattoos are going to be prints of the dogs paws (I have 2 right now, 6 and 7). I'm saving this so I have an idea. 

I can't decide between black and white like this, or ""water color"" with each of the girl's ""color"" worked in."
aww,‚ÄúLook at the size of this human.  He must be the biggest thing in the world.  A giant.  I think we did good picking him!‚Äù
aww,Keep em coming hooman!
aww,He has beautiful markings and color.  Plus endless mischief.  What a cutie!
aww,"He really commits. If I was him I'd be like ""I hope this hole leads somewhere, and I don't just starve in a pit."""
aww,Bod day close enough
aww,Is this the official LadBible office dog?
aww,OPs such a liar. I doubt he even has parents.
aww,"Since my kitty doesn‚Äôt have any teeth (she had bad gingivitis from being a stray cat) we give her soft food. I love the idea of saving money money, though. I‚Äôd probably have to like pur√©e the food myself. I don‚Äôt think buying ground chicken would be small enough for her, but I could be wrong.

We were giving her canned tuna for a while, but I had a friend tell me that I shouldn‚Äôt give her just tuna. I guess it‚Äôs not healthy for her diet to be comprised solely of it. We tried canned salmon, but there often so many bones in it."
aww,My cat used to jump into bed with me and lay there till I was almost asleep before she jumped to the couch.
aww,"Where the deer and the antelope ""PLAY""."
aww,"No no no. Skunks are just about the worst animal you can keep as a pet. First of all they have opposing thumbs so they can open all your jars, second of all they are geniuses and will easily get into your jars, third they live in trees so GOOD LUCK WITH A TREE IN YOUR LIVING ROOM, and third of all they wear a mastk for a reason: They will steal literally all of your jars"

aww,"Nope no ticks luckily, I always check him over. they're not so common round here"
aww,Great long life for sure!
aww,Credit goes to you as well for teaching &amp; fostering the empathy she's showing. Bully for you fellow dad!
aww,"Lol, I thought only my dog was like this. So glad there's more out there!

He sleeps in our bed, but has to be under at least two blankets and right next to me. Very warm, sucks in the summer. I usually need a blanket barrier between us because his breathing is gross."
aww,If you want a small cat just get the runt of a litter. My old cat was probably this size (granted she had normal sized legs) but people always thought she was a kitten even when she was full size.
aww,Daughters are good like that. Cherish it.
aww,"How many blankets you got, a lot.
How many tuck ins you want, a lot."
aww,Must be China. Steamed cat!

aww,"My cousin‚Äôs son also has DMD, but he is only 6 y.o. I hope the science keeps progressing so he can live a longer and healthier life than my cousin thought possible!"
aww,"Anyone know the backstory here?  Because all primates live in groups.  I remember learning in my Anthropology days ""a lone primate is a dead primate"".  Obviously they'd know that and I'd like to think they took that into account here."
aww,Get out of my head
aww,Loving the face flops üí•
aww,"I have a cockatoo and I have never seen him this happy. I'll put on my chainmail and give it a try. He will try to bite my finger, guaranteed!"
aww,"Has nobody noticed how BIG a chimpanzee is?   From watching them on TV, I always thought they were only a couple feet tall.  He is as big as people!!"
aww,"\&gt; Why not mention the name

&amp;#x200B;

I guess cause I couldn't believe there would be two people."
aww,"To be fair, the camera was tracking right in front of him as he walked off. I'm guessing this part was edited to tell the story, but still very moving."
aww,Dude this a repost with literally the exact same header text...
aww,My cat is the same way with bananas and potato chips
aww,Did you flap your hand?
aww,"A varied diet is always good. My point is you don't have to rely on cheap cat food made with meat by-products mixed with grains and water. You can make your own quality cat food for cheaper than garbage canned food, and you definitely don't have to buy the stuff that is $2 for a tiny can.

Obviously you should always do your own research before taking some random internet person's advice, there is plenty of good cat food recipes on the internet. You could consult your vet if you trust them but vets are not infallible either. Many will just lazily tell you to buy canned wet food."
aww,Damn he got a monster butthole
aww,I‚Äôm getting pizza right now actually so same?
aww,Oh man growing up I was in a basement room in Canada. It was so cold down there because my parents got a wood stove that was too close to the thermostat upstairs so the forced air furnace never kicked in. They‚Äôd turn the heat on for half an hour at 6am so we‚Äôd be warm enough to get dressed.
aww,Wait till you look in the mirror.
aww,"We made sure to love on him as much ass possible too, still coping with it but what better way to honor a pet than to post to Reddit, right? üòÇ"
aww,Legacy? She is still alive!
aww,this is the cutest thing ever omg!!
aww,I thought cats couldn't taste sweetness?
aww,"All he ever said was ""Hey baby wanna fling my feces with me?"" smh my head...had he only said feces instead of his own he would be free right now"
aww,I'm pretty sure that green eyes are also the standard for korats.
aww,That‚Äôs the rabbit from the holy grail
aww,"Wow, they look amazing. What breed are they?"
aww,I think I‚Äôd like to start hugging people butt first from now on.
aww,Faith in mankind restored temporarily.

aww,"Therapy dogs? For finals?

&amp;#x200B;

oooof...what is this country coming to?"
aww,"Listen, I don't like abortion. Especially depending on the age of the fetus, but I also see the importance in stem cell research. It's like a miracle for people that were told that things were impossible. We need to further this research....and if fetus' are going to be aborted regardless? Then why aren't we doing what we can with what is just going to waste? Make something of a sacrifice that was made. 

Just don't promote abortion FOR the stem cells. Also, Embryonic Stem Cells come from 4-5 day old blastocysts that are otherwise destroyed. I support that testing completely."
aww,Obviously the nearest store didn't have the cigarettes he likes.
aww,"I feel like the gif ended to soon. Either she was about to make biscuits before laying down, or she pounced on the camera"
aww,Yeah it's honestly not that bad. I'm probably going to keep a colder house/apartment when I'm older.
aww,I'm reminded of the containment lab from The Andromeda Strain
aww,Love you so much Schnoodle!!!
aww,That is probably the most perfect calico cat I have ever seen. I want your cat!!!!!
aww,I bet the cat likes it because of the texture. If you think about it it kind of has the texture of a cats tongue
aww,Maybe he's really excited to give you your first walk in 7 years :)
aww,This guy has a gift.
aww,"My mom's African grey used to literally call the dog over to her, then due to bad habits from past owners would just mutter 'fucking dog' once the dog got to the cage."
aww,I would never recommend giving canned tuna. It's fine for an emergency if that's all you have in the house but there is just way too much added sodium in those cans for a kitty.
aww,"Good post but unfortunately it has been removed because it has been posted recently by another user:

aww,"Wonderful!   I am so happy that medicine continues to pursue stem cell therapy.   Does anyone remember in 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush introduced a ban on federal funding for research on human embryonic stem (ES) cell lines???  I am so grateful the conservatives finally got on board with this important area of progress.   I am grateful to see your son's progress, may he continue improving!    I wonder how much further science can take stem cell research?

aww,I‚Äôve read ‚ÄúIn The Shadow of Man‚Äù by Jane Goodall and it was a fascinating read
aww,what kind of rehab? booze? pills?
aww,He is so adorable! My heart! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
aww,Oh this post and all the comments are so blessed. I‚Äôm going to go watch Hook now.
aww,"I‚Äôve seen doggies without eyes, with parts of their ears missing, with missing limbs but I have never seen a nose-less pup! 

I hope he never loses his other senses! God bless him!

Are his teeth sticking out like that due to him not having a snout?"
aww,"She‚Äôs got 4 legs, she can move if she gets hot."
aww,Have you ever tried DMT?
aww,My dog has multiple beds and prefers the cold hard floor in the unheated cupboard at the back of the house.
aww,Thanks for the tip!
aww,"Jane Goodall. I don't know if she's Catholic, but is there any way we can make her a saint?"
aww,My cat was taken away from her mama way too early. She has no idea how to groom herself.
aww,"I am an evolutionary biologist, and I'm happy to tell you that you're right! ...ish. Humans are adapted for long distance bipedalism, which does require larger gluteal muscles, so you're exactly on point there. Note, however, that humans also lack the ischeal callosities (basically butt padding) that other primates do have, so by that measure, we're actually lacking some of the thicc that is our primate birthright."
aww,I wish mine would snuggle next to me instead of demanding my chest- as close to my face to the point I put extra blanket so once he lays down I can pull him down with the blanket. That and he uses my hand as a pillow and likes to touch my face with his paw
aww,I was gonna write the same thing üòÇ
aww,It‚Äôs a older unit but still a absolute one!
aww,"Stinky seems like a missed opportunity.  Your CATS brought him home and you don't name him ""Pepe Le Pew""??    Capital WTF?"
aww,I just sat watching this three or four times saying aww out loud
aww,"Is that the same for cats? Cuz if so, my cats are respecting the F out of me every time I lay back on the recliner."
aww,"Not mention the heat they generate and the mid-evening heavy panting when they get overheated. 

Good playmates, good for couch cuddles, disruptive to sleep."
aww,I wonder if this was the one they accidentally exposed to polio.
aww,i know this was a while ago... anyone know who this one is and how well ..she?  did out there?

*I'm a bot so if I was wrong, reply to me and a moderator will check it.*"
aww,"I briefly met Jane Goodall once at a book signing. After she signed my book, I commented to my friend that Jane has this sort of ‚Äústillness‚Äù about her. One of the people who were on her touring team heard and agreed with me. I suppose decades of observing chimps in the wild must have taught her more quietness and patience that most human beings could ever think was possible"
aww,lol  *peels banana breaks off a piece and passes the rest around*
aww,My guess is those were guides or forest rangers to help the women and were not involved with the rehab.
aww,Everyone is replying about the muscles and fat...I'm wanting to know about that herniated booty hole. Yikes. I'm glad we wear britches. I'd hate to be so exposed.
aww,Now i demand a setup like legends of the hidden temple complete with temple guards.
aww,"Collars shouldn‚Äôt be left on at home, they are a strangulation risk. Collars should only be used when supervised outside or leashed."
aww,"""... and on the sixth day god created cats"""
aww,Seeing as you're walking around shirtless it can't be too cold a basement?
aww,"Just curious, is he gonna be safe in the wild? Would another pack of chimps accept him or just kill him?"
aww,Thank you for sharing this.
aww,"How adorable. I always tried to cover my dogs, but they weren't fans of blankets. Your pup looks like she's in heaven."
aww,That hug must have felt amazing for both of them
aww,Came here to say that very thing!
aww,For a sec I thought that was a white elephant
aww,This made my face leak.
aww,I dont about all Boston's but mine lives his blankets and jammies. We don't let him sleep in jammies but if its winter he has them on all day pretty much and if you take them off he tries to out them back on
aww,Someone hand me a Kleenex
aww,"He was just going to work. Hes a lumberjack dont you know.

https://youtu.be/pfRdur8GLBM"
aww,The rarest of puppers
aww,"the guy in red/brown or the guy in green? bc the one in green was clearly trying to avoid the chimp at all costs, he moved away any time it came close to him lol"
aww,"You can absolutely use a collar on a small dog, you just need to train them not to pull. In fact, if you want to show or trial with your dog, you must use a collar. However, it‚Äôs not good to leave a collar on at home, especially if they‚Äôre not being supervised."
aww,Great minds think alike
aww,Why are you wearing the same thing?
aww,Black dude behind her is like 'you better hug me as well!'
aww,"Damnit, I‚Äôm crying in my car right now."
aww,"Cat foods are designed for cats with all the nutrients they need.  They will have health problems from a ""DIY"" diet since the cat food companies (at least the good ones) do research to make sure cats get the stuff they need to be healthy.  I would follow vet recs if you think your canned food is not good enough."
aww,RDJ has the most beautiful brown eyes.
aww,My dogs are like that
aww,"Lmao. I didn‚Äôt know that the institution got upset over that one, because Jane Goodall herself has been pretty open about actually enjoying the cartoon. She even wrote a forward for one of the Far Side Galleries. I guess the peeps at the institute assumed she would have been upset about it."
aww,My Cat was drinking soapy dishwater behind my back earlier
aww,"I was so worried, knowing that it is Reddit, that lil guy might encounter some unfortunate event at the end. OP might have made me physically worried for a hamster for the first time in my life."
aww,Exactly! All of these ppl with their Google degrees don't know shit about the breed. They make me sick. Munchkin cats are awesome &amp; don't have the problems these idiots think they do..
aww,"Look at my ass, ya'll take a good long look at my ass.

Oh fuk, mom here? None ya'll saw my assl"
aww,I think it would probably be treated case to case. From what I understand in these situations is rehabilitation means they have made sure the animal is non dependent (as far as their knowledge goes). But if an animal showed dependent qualities like an inability to or no desire to seek out food. Then they would deem that animal recovered but dependent on human control to live. Which they would then find a home for.
aww,This was seconds before crawling into bed. I also love the cold. My girlfriend not so much
aww,[This is him in case anyone wanted to put a face to the name](https://imgur.com/7mdYivs)
aww,So then why is there a cut scene ? The footage seems to jump at those points.
aww,"Collars shouldn‚Äôt be left on at home on any dog. Collars can be used on a brachy or small dog, you simply need to train the dog to walk nicely and not pull. Plenty of small and brachy dogs show and trial in collars, because collars are required."
aww,Who is cutting all those damn onions in here!?
aww,Not in the UK
aww,"You have the old mindset of cat food. Almost all the vets I‚Äôve visited the last few years have said dry food is not longer recommended because cats often don‚Äôt drink enough water to compensate for the dry food which then increases their risk of dehydration related diseases. There is also very little dry food out there that have ‚Äúquality‚Äù ingredients, even though some try hard to, but a lot of nutrients get lost in the processing process no matter how ‚Äúquality‚Äù their ingredients are.

My cats have already had issues on a mostly dry diet, although it isn‚Äôt the case for ALL cats it‚Äôs still a risk. In nature cats get a lot of their moisture content from their food. Helping with their teeth is probably the only benefit to dry food but doesn‚Äôt outweigh the vast benefits of diets closer to their natural ones. (My cats have also had dental issues with their mostly dry diet as well). There are reasons they‚Äôre on mostly-dry, as with other cat owners who end up feeding mostly or all dry diet but I‚Äôve already typed enough."
aww,"His face is like ""You're damn right I found these""."
aww,"you can train dogs to do almost anything, its kinda crazy"
aww,I understood that reference
aww,OK....I went back and watched again.....ya the guy is like just kinda ripped. Cute dog and buff owner.

Let me tell you, I got so fucking mad lol"
aww,Did she stop being great lately?
aww,Plugged in my headphones just for this. Was not disappointed.
aww,That bitch got him trained
aww,"Ugh, lion meant to do that to rid the bad rep."
aww,i can see that wiggly tail in the background&lt;3
aww,You're bad at animals.
aww,"This deserves the gold I can't afford.

So, thank you."
aww,Im not crying... you're crying
aww,Kinda looks like baby Puss in boots
aww,"And for next time, class, we will be learning how to intrusively sit on laptops."
aww,"Whoa there cowboy. It isn't that simple.

A cat can't survive off of chicken thighs and hearts. Think for a moment about what a cat is eating when it kills prey in the wild. It isn't just eating thighs and hearts. It's eating livers, brains, eyeballs, bones... basically everything except fur. If you just feed your cat thighs and hearts, it will die of malnutrition.

If you are going to cook food for your cat, you need to at the very least do it under the supervision of a veterinarian and add a supplement that puts in all the nutrients that a cat needs. And once you've done those two things and bought the meat, you are paying more for cat food than you would at the store and you're spending more time on it as well.

Now, the very cheapest brand of cat food is disgusting and basically made from roadkill and I would not recommend it. But if you get a decent brand, it is better than making it yourself."
aww,Jane Goodall is one of my biggest heroes.
aww,My husband had a boss who keeps a dollar bill in his wallet from the first date he had with his wife over twenty years previous. On the date he wrote ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry this woman‚Äù on it and put it in a separate part of his wallet to keep.
aww,She better not die
aww,I grew up in an area where we hunted and ate morels. They are amazing!

aww,Whatever you do don't watch the entirety of Endgame before your meeting
aww,"Go to youtube, search jeff berwick stem cells.

This will lead you to stem cell therapy in Mexico. They are much further along than USA."
aww,I cant speak to their full range but they are fairly common here in northern WI
aww,My cat loves orange Bell peppers for whatever reason. My other cat ate ranch and chili cheese Fritos. I'm not sure that they're really cats
aww,"That's like my cat, but with string cheese."
aww,That'd make sense. I didn't watch as closely as you did.
aww,"if i can get it below 60, i'm pretty happy.  i have a shepherd and a down comforter.  i don't really lack for heat in the middle of the night lol"
aww,"I've never heard of Jacques Cousteau. 

My dumbass kept thinking of chef Gusteau from Ratatouille."
aww,I stopped running this spring and my temps went down to 55 some nights.  65 or so in the day.
aww,Really? It‚Äôs still got a dark nose shape. Isn‚Äôt that uncanny.
aww,"Basically, your boyfriend and his family left you alone with the dog while spending the night together without you. Without context, I find that a bit rude."
aww,"It isn't that weird. If we really like someone, we eat their ass."
aww,slow down the decay process and such?
aww,Almost all mammals play.  Its probably part of wiring up the cerebral cortex.
aww,"My cat loves Zesty Doritos chips. He also hates wet food will only eat dry food, but if food falls to the floor he will eat it."
aww,"I like how he gets on top of that container just showing his butt like ""FEAST YOUR EYES"""
aww,"Yeah she is one of the trimates.  
Dian Fossey - Gorilla  
Jane Goodall - Chimpanzee   
Birute Galdikas - Orangutans 

They were chosen by anthropologist Louis Leakey to study the primates in their natural habitats."
aww,Speedy recovery little one!
aww,A good boy's sense of love cannot be physically removed.
aww,"I'm not crying, you're crying... üò¢
Seriously tho, her facial expression almost made me lose it lol"
aww,She likes the tang that the toilet water has to it
aww,"Thank you for the info. Your comments about the genetic problems helped me realize the true cost of producing a ""pure"" breed, which just means ""deeply inbred""."
aww,"""I love you 3000"" - RDJ probably"
aww,"I did not read it as ""kitties"" the first time.  You'd be correct either way."
aww,I had a heated waterbed in my Canadian teen basement years. I HATED getting out of bed in winter. I'd get dressed in bed.
aww,haha i thought you might like those! Took some more pictures last night
aww,"Kinda lol, you supposedly live long in a cooler environment as compared to a warmer one."
aww,He can tuck me in anytime.

aww,There was a gorilla researcher that was killed by poachers wasn't there?
aww,That hug... That look of complete love on her face. Beautiful.
aww,That's so damn amazing. :D Glad to see this.
aww,"Yup, later the next day those SAME rangers came back and poached the shit out of that chimp, and many like it. This is a sick fucked up fact."
aww,Sorry If you don't care man. I'm just happy about my family commitment!
aww,"Actually, he was going to hug the camera man, but stopped filming before then."
aww,"Unless you are talking about Seelengef√ºhlisshei·∫ûekeit, which is rather self-explanatory."
aww,Just popped out for smokes
aww,Most primates are herbivores. Male chimps actually have a diet that is about 10% protein from hunting cooperatively. So this guy will be fine foraging and will likely join a community as a low ranking male.
aww,I feel like this dude considers the lobster
aww,"Assuming it did, nobody there would be able to stop the chimp. This is awesome, but I personally wouldn't be able to enjoy it. I would just be in a panic the entire time."
aww,I don't know that I'll ever understand why unsolicited advice from a stranger on the Internet carries more value for some people than direct advice from a professional.
aww,This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day. I can end my day here. Thank you OP ü•∞üê≠
aww,"Rocky spent the first year of his 2 year life bouncing around from home to home with people that would leave him 6-8 hours a day in the yard and gave him little attention. He's horrified of belts for reasons I don't like thinking about. When I got him, we were warned he'd be a lot of work, but surprisingly all he needed was love and affection to be the good boy we thought he could be. He loves kids, other dogs, and he's just now starting to trust adults (mainly males)."
aww,oooh lawd! i was joking lol the more you know!
aww,"Because of the quality of the video I thought this was an older clip and that first, younger woman was Jane. ""Wow she really was pretty cute when she was younger."" And then I realized the truth and that is, well, she's still adorable at her newly minted age."
aww,To me it's like organ donation. Why throw away what you can use?
aww,Just knowing that I've existed at the same time as this amazing woman gives me goosebumps. She is an absolute treasure for all she has done.
aww,Damn that was a real gosh darn hug.

aww,My 75-100 lb Golden retrievers growing up we‚Äôre all a better bedfellow than my SO‚Äôs 25 lb small dog. I don‚Äôt understand how they take up SO MUCH SPACE
aww,I love when cats and dogs get along
aww,"Jane Goodall has to be one of the most noble, kind, and beautiful people humanity has ever seen."
aww,"He,he, I've never seen him as Bolt, but wow, you're right. His name is Rynno."
aww,She was observing you.
aww,"I think he might be on the spectrum. He seems a little off, just saying."
aww,I just got the happiest feeling from watching this sweet old boy!  May he have many more joyful years ‚ù§Ô∏è

aww,Had to click on this one....phew.  Every single click becomes a risky click when you haven't seen Endgame yet.
aww,In the past I confused her with Dian Fossey
aww,I consider the lobster.
aww,"&gt;Idea : Meet the owners. Tell them about how the dog brightens your day every day. Buy the dog a large water bowl at this point. Give it to the owners as a gift and a thank you for having a good dog. Make it clear without being rude that the one you got is an outdoor water bowl.

Thank you for writing this! It's SUCH a good approach, and I would never have thought of it on my own."
aww,"Kitten massages will be the new hot thing.

People will be prepared to pay $100 an hour for it."
aww,"I once read that when she was 5 she went missing for an afternoon. She had asked everyone she knew about where the eggs came from, and no one knew, so she hid between the chicken until she say one of them laying an egg.
And later when she went back to her mom to tell her she was so excited that her mom couldn't be angry for hiding all afternoon.
That's one of my favourite stories about her"
aww,"I think that‚Äôs a keeper for sure it‚Äôs gust adorable and oh so cute ,have to say love your show ."

aww,Aaaand now I'm crying. Thanks I Love It
aww,It's honestly not that bad once you get used to it. However I have a heater in my room to bump the temp up at night lol. My feet can take an hour+ to warm up otherwise.
aww,It happens to me all the time üò¨
aww,Am I the only one that was absolutely terrified by the chimp and how it came out of the cage?
aww,Designed? Shurley you mean 'evolved'.
aww,"Haha! This just made me laugh. He doesn't like people seeing him with his walker because he ""looks like an old man"" but flames would be so awesome!"
aww,Fun fact - a scientist proved mice can learn by having a mouse do the same maze each day and every day the time got better. Other scientists experiments show that mice cannot learn - same time every time. Reviewed the scientist‚Äôs work and turns out the scientist wasn‚Äôt cleaning out the maze after each use so the mouse was following its own scent and each time the scent got stronger
aww,"I tried to find it. But r/aww is pretty full of posts. Didnt find it, so idk."
aww,"Yes, officer, this comment right here."

aww,"Dian Fossey. It was never confirmed, but her whole research team was detained.

Edit: by local police"
aww,"This always makes me think that it started out as ""animals will only show you their back if they are not currently threatened by you"" and eventually people kept changing that meaning to ""they trust you"" and ""they respect you"" and ""the ultimate sign of respect from an animal""."

Mine had the same issue and it was really painful for him. He had to have a few teeth extracted."
aww,This is cool. Keep up the good work
aww,I sat in a lecture last Friday night regarding Duchenne‚Äôs and the use of CRISPR/CAS9 in helping patients. Didn‚Äôt know a single thing about this until then. Amazing stuff and so happy to see another success!

aww,I would imagine stillness is a great quality to have when working with wild animals who could kill you at a moment‚Äôs notice.
aww,I don't know what the reason that chimp got rehabilitated but it sure as shit was not for hemorrhoids.
aww,"That's Marvelous!!! I absolutely love it!!!

aww,I thought that was Jason Mraz.
aww,Is she funny or something?
aww,Who cares about cheating only important thing is seeing his fat ass sliding down the levels... Satishfied
aww,This is actually very dangerous. That chimp now is more likely to trust humans which makes them more vulnerable to poachers. That‚Äôs why most rehabilitation centres let them live with other animals of their species with as little intervention as possible.
aww,This put a big smile on my face after a hard day. Thanks!
aww,Aw man that's what I said but you already had this thought an hour ago :(

aww,Because we didn't evolve from a common ancestor.

aww,It is but he learned a lot and will soon be helping the other chimps do their taxes.
aww,Not an evolutionary biologist but read alot and i too dont think running is all we are about. And tbh all we needed to do was just keep cool for longer than our prey. As a group mammal i think all we had to do was just keep moving. Once we learned to hurt and frighten our prey and move fast enough to keep them moving we just literally ran our prey into the ground.
aww,The video isn‚Äôt OP‚Äôs
aww,"And somehow this must tie into why I‚Äôm attracted to ladies with a nice round booty.

Ahhh yes that girl can definitely run long distances and help me hunt down our meals with a phat ass like that."

aww,"She has and will continue to, forevers"
aww,All dogs/cats are do to inbreeding to get a certain look then that because a pure bred dog/cat for $1000 I know all that. It's shitty but has been going on for 100+ years. But yeah little short cat is cute ü§∑
aww,"&gt;nest

Was it a bird dog?"
aww,"If there's something I've learned from reddit, it's that a post with a chimp and a black man in the same frame usually gets locked pretty quickly."
aww,That look he gave the treeline said it all.
aww,that's a frickin fire hazard! Or at least a recipe for a sweaty pups. I know dogs don't have sweat glands. But they could.
aww,"I here the sheep from family guy in this one, ‚Äúright there, moooreee oh yeaaa‚Äù"
aww,"Depends on the age of the chimpanzee when they were captured. If the chimpanzee wasn't raised in a group setting with their mothers, then they usually cant be reintroduced into the wild. You can look up chimpanzee orphanages if you want üò•"
aww,I‚Äôm patiently awaiting the ruby throats that frequent my feeders.  Should be any day now.  They are such a treat to watch.  It‚Äôs amazing to hear them too.  Highly territorial birds will squeak and fight over feeders.

aww,when she was hugging it i couldn't help but wonder what a chimpanzee smells like.

aww,When can you peak over the maze wall but _still_ do an exhaustive depth-first search.
aww,"Same. Was just about to reply basically this, but you beat me to it!"
aww,No. Talk to your vet before you start feeding them raw meat. Making a balanced cat diet from commercially available meats and organs is much more complicated than it sounds. Likely you will have to buy supplements to add to the food and it will be more expensive than canned cat food from a premium brand.
aww,Arent strawberries from the catnip family?
aww,Fwiw that would be $50-$100 at our local farmers market.

You can get them on Amazon, they are like $40 or something, not a super ton of money and my pets love them in the winter, especially the short haired breeds.  The cat beds are even cheaper, I currently have  a cat that basically camps out on that thing in the winter."

aww,"""got a problem with this, human?"""
aww,"Well idk the backstory but the title says rehabilitated.  So my take is imagine laying in a field, injured and alone and some strange animals came and comforted you, fixed you, fed you and made things better. You'd be appreciative but still want to go home. Imagine living in a hospital"

aww,"You‚Äôre thinking along the right lines. This chimp, Wounda, isn‚Äôt being released into the wild wild - she is being released onto a controlled island sanctuary without poachers, disease or wild chimpanzees.

aww,"Cat/Dog/Birb trainer here.... work up to this extremely slowly or you will make your bird very upset. By extremely slowly I mean letting him just get used to seeing the brush for at least a couple days and don't try to touch him with it until he's comfortable.

We actually had to start jogging to keep up with her. It was nice to see her enjoy herself and have the energy to really just be a dog. She ended up passing later that year."

There's also some evidence that more empathetic primates will hug more, recovering from stress and trauma more quickly as a result.

aww,Technically *Dame* Jane Goodall. I think being named a Dame is the equivalent of being knighted for women in England.
aww,"For a shelter dog walks are everything.  We used slip leash and 95% dogs at the shelter you could just crack the gate, stick the loop through, and the dog would shove it's head through the loop.  Normally with most dogs, I'd just open the door and sort of would catch them with the loop.  I say sort of because most dogs actively tried to get the leash on.  They all knew leash = walk/yard/playgroup."
aww,"""Cat lollipop gifs""

TIL Eliza Dushku is a cat"
aww,Kept reminding me of an athlete wiping sweat off with a towel!
aww,"Hey, now it is mine too. Thanks for sharing."
aww,"Yes üôå. I'm very rarely on social media because of all the negativity, but this thread makes me smile. You'll still get those few people that didn't listen when their mom told them ""if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all,"" but what can you do üòÅ."
aww,I had a cat that was obsessed with strawberries. Every time I came home from the grocery store she would come running to inspect the bags and would always go straight to the one with the strawberries. One day I gave her one just to see what she would do and she just rubbed her cheeks on the green part for a few minutes. What's with cats and strawberries?
aww,I *do* look good in a red bandana...
aww,It was Jane's closed eyes during the hug and the fact they both seemed so comfortable embracing what got me
aww,This is wholesome as FUCK
aww,Having a fan on in a closed room
aww,What if you got two of them? Couldn't they play together?
aww,That's crazy man. Have you tried DMT?
aww,‚ÄúSon of a bitch!‚Äù
aww,They also bare their teeth in a sort of smile to show submission
aww,My dog does this kind of grab when playing and I always thought it was weird. Maybe she spent some time with a cat?
aww,"Right, I‚Äôm saying that she *doesn‚Äôt* care about milk, but she *does* like ice cream."
aww,Past life habitual addiction
aww,He looks very pleased with himself. I can‚Äôt help but be happy for him :)
aww,"in Brooklyn accent to dog: ""I'm walkin here"""
aww,Why do I get the feeling that your dog wants to talk to the manager?
aww,Dogs and pigs have both been trained to find mushrooms and especially truffles
aww,She actually does live in Alabama
aww,Oh my gosh each snoot is more boopable than the next!
aww,"Interesting. Do you have a source for this? I wrote ""Jane Goodall Soldiers captive"" and nothing came up."
aww,"This NEEDS a platinum award, unfortunately I‚Äôm poor."
aww,I'm on my 3rd Boston and all 3 have always needed to burrow under the covers!
aww,That‚Äôs good because I‚Äôm not sure where this is but I was going to drive there and get him.

aww,I think snoopy has been smoking some Marijuana as welll... again!
aww,And I thought fidget spinners were out. I'd buy one but only if it looked like this :P
aww,"Absolutely - although the whole thing with ""medical ethics"" is that whilst people wring-hands and worry, someone (usuaully in China) is doing it anyway

&amp;#x200B;

It will save many lives and probably wipe-us-out completely in the end ;0"
aww,"Owww my teeth, owww my head!"
aww,"Haha, my parents have that same blanket (the fluffy dog print) and use it to tuck in the cats when its nap time!"
aww,Thanks for the links. It's an interesting topic and I want to know the real facts. I know reddit likes to jump on anything that seems cute and make wild claims about an animal's emotions so it's good to have a scientific source that doesn't anthromorphise everything
aww,jaguar comes out of nowhere and side blinds that chimp as the team watches in horror
aww,TIL I am incapable of thought and emotion. I knew this was a simulation all along!

aww,Great! I hope he really likes it.
aww,That little grey kitten had a rough day.
aww,"AWww my dog is like that, just wants us to bring her to her crate, but always demands it LOLOL"
aww,"It's not a direct comparison, but I've always enjoyed 'making of' sections for wildlife documentaries and this seems to be a quality that wildlife cameramen also tend to have. From a solely practical perspective, it's a necessity to be able to be physically very still, but I think there's something deeper there; that spending so much time observing nature lends itself to mindfulness. You can watch lives and stories play out which are totally independent of whether you care or not, or whether you even exist; it's different to watching anything that a human has made for another human to see. A good way to avoid how demanding the world of human-to-human interaction - directly or through media - is. But that's just me armchair philosophising."
aww,If they have been trained to do something for treats then are they wild?
aww,The only thing thats made me cry in a long time.
aww,"Yeah, definitely, from the pictures on google they look really similar. Such a gorgeous breed :D"
aww,"I wish people would stop with the ridiculous ‚Äúanimal talk‚Äù text. 

Funny picture though!"
aww,And you didn‚Äôt show the walk? üò≠
aww,This definitely should be in an Eddie Bauer catalogue.
aww,At least you got goodbye hugs :\
aww,HOW DID YOU SET THIS UP!?  How did you get him to actively search for a way down and not climb over the walls!?  It‚Äôs SO amazing!

aww,I was thinking favorite toy.

aww,"‚ÄòHold up, im just gonna fart on you one more time‚Äô"
aww,That's one of the most beautiful cats I've seen !
aww,"Oh man, I had a dog as a kid who should chase bird shadows across the yard. He was beautiful and sweet, but dumb as a rock. I loved him."
aww,The day Jane Goodall dies I‚Äôm gonna cry.
aww,Yeah I tried looking for the cat's asshole but couldn't find it.
aww,Question is how long she stays like this? My dog gets bored with it after 5 minutes or so
aww,Hey whatcha GIMMIE THAT SHIT
aww,People - we need to be guardians of animals. Please take care of them.

aww,I love it when black dogs get the grey chin fur!  They look adorable like that.
aww,"They're not being bred for slaughter, they're to be sold as pets"
aww,"That explains a lot. When we got our second cat, she must have been not more than ten weeks old. We took her in from the streets, where she had been roaming for a couple of days and nobody seemed to want her. We noticed that she seemed to be watching and copying our older cat."
aww,"Yes, but then they tend to exclude you from their ""social circle"" and can become aggressive/uncooperative. This is why breeding pairs tend to be cage only birds whereas well trained single parrots will happily love everyone and run around the house like a cat so long as they are provided sufficient attention."
aww,He probably loves you too.
aww,"All year, for me!"

aww,Im not crying you're crying.
aww,"Hammie is probably washing his face for a loooong time. My hamsters all could get distracted even from attention they wanted to wash their face for five minutes. My one Syrian girl that looked like this one would seek attention from me, my ex-husband, and my pet rabbit (Who enjoyed her better from afar lol). Then she‚Äôd get distracted and wash her face. Then if there was food put near her? Time to put allllll of that in her mouth and stash it two inches away from her bowl (of course, the cleverest hiding spot even though her house was enormous like five feet by two and a half feet)."
aww,Something about her face is so pretty. I wanna put a flower crown on her.
aww,"Don't judge me, it's like friendship. Everyone can see it but only I get the warm feeling."

aww,The stupid in most of these comments is amazing.
aww,"The coat?

aww,looks like an obese deer
aww,That white one is cute!
aww,Did both cats' eye color change? Or were they different to begin with?
aww,settle down Jon Snow
aww,"Veterinarian here, everyone please stop upvoting this dangerous advice. A nutritionally balanced diet for cats needs more than just chicken thighs and hearts. Chicken heart alone isn't a sufficient source of taurine, and there's a laundry list of other micronutrients that a thigh + heart muscle-only diet is deficient in. Nutritional deficiencies can cause your cat to become ill or can be potentially (especially in the case of taurine deficiency leading to a nutritional dilated cardiomyopathy) deadly. If you don't like feeding your cat a commercially prepared diet that's totally fine, but you should consult with a veterinarian to get a properly balanced home cooking recipe to feed your cat."
aww,"Of course they do. Anyone who has spent time around dogs knows when they are excited, happy, sad, etc. That doesn't mean they're a direct equivalent of the human emotion, but they definitely have them. We're just another animal ourselves."

aww,Puppy had to break so hard it broke the ground
aww,"If you're into electronic music he did a collab with the Crystal Method, a song called Drown in The Now. To be honest, I've never actually heard any other songs of his, so I don't know what album it's in, it might even be in the album that you bought, but personally, I was hooked the second I heard it."

aww,"If it makes you feel better, when I was 7, my aunt told me Jane was killed by poachers. So when my class went on a field trip to the zoo, and got to a info wall of her, I was telling everyone that she was murdered. I looked like a moron when my teacher and zoo worker, both, told us that she was alive. I legitimately don't know where my aunt got this ""info"" but she said it with such confidence-almost like a ""I'm ready to prove whoever argues this statement wrong"" demeanor, when she said it.

aww,That's a lot of blankets for a dog isn't going to overheat?
aww,"This brought tears to my eyes, I hope he‚Äôll be ok out there."
aww,That last hug was just wonderful. So much emotions that can‚Äôt be expressed by words between the chimp and Jane.
aww,We didn't really evolve from chimps.  Technically you could say we both do it because of the Hominini which is the last common ancestor of chimps and humans.
aww,How's life in the Antarctic?
aww,dude what Bible are you reading?
aww,He looks very satisfied with his life.
aww,Where do you reside for slow country roads to have palm trees and steel power poles? That‚Äôs a paradise for my people.
aww,This is reddit science.
aww,"That would be your dog, mine doesn't. What she understands is that when I point my finger at something, I change my tone to the one I use when I want her to be alert and look ahead.

They understand our voice tones better than us."
aww,Should‚Äôve named him Shat Squirrel
aww,"Don't remove it! When it comes down naturally, keep it somewhere :)"
aww,That is such an amazing way to think of it. We humans tend to put ourselves above the animals. Yet we are also just developed animals!
aww,Not all heroes where capes.
aww,"I had to use a walker for a bit and I felt the same way (I was 21). If I had ended up using it or the cane permanently, I totally would have made it look awesome. I got lucky and was able to do away with both, surpassing doctors' predictions. I hope you son surpasses expectations too!"
aww,"It's spelled ""such"" btw idk what that other guy is doing."

yeah, I don't know what he's doing either."
aww,This dude figured it how to herd cats!
aww,"Veterinarian here. I spend a frustrating amount of my day having people argue that I'm wrong because ""my breeder said"". The only qualification for being a breeder is owning two dogs of opposite sex and managing not to get in the way of them having sex with each other. I went through 8 years of higher education to get my DVM. But yeah, fuck me for telling people that they should vaccinate their pets. Clearly the dog pimp with a GED level education knows more about the safety of leptospirosis vaccines than I do."
aww,I don‚Äôt know if the name is rude or adorable
aww,"Didn't she train chimps to work in a diamond mine?

Or was that only a Simpsons gag?"
aww,I'm not crying your crying
aww,Boston terriers I‚Äôve found are the most uptight dogs. Even when you don‚Äôt try to spoil them you end up creating a dog that whenever you sit down you have to fluff up a blanket next to you for them in order to appease them
aww,"Southwest Florida! Our area has sections that are the perfect combo of residential and rural. You‚Äôre not in the middle of nowhere, but you can still have land and livestock."

aww,This  is the correct method.
aww,Wow. I hope to one day matter to someone the way those people mattered to the chimp.
aww,This whole time I just thought my dog loved having his butt scratched because he will basically throw his butt at anyone he sees for longer than 5 minutes.
aww,I love the back turned ears!!
aww,"That was very touching, tearing up right now. Thank you."
aww,Your ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù is grammatically correct but for some reason I am still being filled with a kind of rage over this sentence.
aww,Where is its mum üò≠
aww,"Read the Wikipedia article on Humans.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human

&gt;A terrestrial animal, humans are characterized by their erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; open-ended and complex language use compared to other animal communications; larger, more complex brains than other animals; and highly advanced and organized societies.

&gt; The spread of the large and increasing population of humans has profoundly affected much of the biosphere and millions of species worldwide. Advantages that explain this evolutionary success include a larger brain with a well-developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, which enable advanced abstract reasoning, language, problem solving, sociality, and culture through social learning.

&gt; These human societies subsequently expanded, establishing various forms of government, religion, and culture around the world, and unifying people within regions to form states and empires. The rapid advancement of scientific and medical understanding in the 19th and 20th centuries permitted the development of fuel-driven technologies and increased lifespans, causing the human population to rise exponentially."
aww,"Awwwww, OMG, I love you OP, really!&lt;3"
aww,You don't build a nest for your bare ass before you go to sleep?

aww,You can train them to hunt for truffles too!
aww,I‚Äôm so glad he got a treat at the end or I would‚Äôve been reeeeeeally upset
aww,So now we can't appreciate attractive people? We have to act like like we're all asexual all the time now?
aww,I actually had a cat that I named Princess Fluffy Pants that I adopted from the Humane Society
aww,our boston loves being tucked in. he will also stare at you until you turn the lights off at bed time.
aww,They say you gotta crawl before you walk...and it paid off for him. I don't think my able body could carry myself that far without huffing and puffing.
aww,"Yes, animal agriculture is the number one cause of deforestation and rainforest destruction. That doesn‚Äôt mean blame others, though. It‚Äôs our personal demands for animal products that cause this. Stop the demand, stop the supply."
aww,"In relationships Lions seem alot more like dogs then cats.  Is that because they are pack (pride) animals?

Would a puma or jaguar (lone hunters) not bond with humans as permanently?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: spelling"
aww,That moment when he hugged her üòç
aww,I'm so thankful for the evolution of human butt-holes
aww,Rats are so much cuter when you dont find them in a restaurant üòÉ
aww,Dude in the back looks like he needs a hug too

aww,"I met her once.

She's pretty cool."

aww,I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs any better lol
aww,Look at those furry ears!!
aww,"Exactly. A dog will ALWAYS expand to take the maximum amount of bed space possible, even if the dog is small.

aww,It‚Äôs a good day for that guy

aww,He‚Äôs a little vacuum cleaner
aww,The Mushrooms look like the heads of the amygdalas from Bloodborn \(^_^) /
aww,Sure but dogs or other animals with no butcheeks dont have their anusses hanging out like a wet sleeve. Even cows pucker up their assholes. It looks so .. loose? When they sit it must feel like a cold wet towel.

aww,"She calls it a mayonegg, isn't that cute?"
aww,Jane‚Äôs the best. Such a fitting embrace.

 She discovered that monkeys used tools, like a stick, to put in ant hills to get ants out to eat.

And also that they eat meat."
aww,This one's a keeper!
aww,Can I get full package?
aww,"Haha well cats and birds are not historically well suited. A dog won't provide sufficient social interaction, they need engagement with problem solving and learning. 

One person is sufficient to keep a bird happy, and you only need to dedicate like 30-60 minutes a day. That can be direct playtime or just essentially ""fidget-spinning"" with your bird while you do stuff. Mine likes to hang out on the couch and watch Netflix while I scratch his head and mess with him, or hang out in the kitchen on a perch while cooking, etc. Hell he used to wrap up in my mums housecoat on sundays and nap with her while she stayed in bed to watch cooking shows. You'd just see a beak sneak out and try to grab the remote now and then."
aww,So cute. You are good dog parents. Mine will tap me on the shoulders with his paw so I can lift up the blankets and let them in to sleep.
aww,old pic that kitten is full grown now.
aww,"When she sees a squirrel,bird, etc she opens her mouth like this and chatters her jaws. And it sounds like she is stuttering lol. It‚Äôs common for cats to chatter when around squirrels and such. Google it."
aww,"Had a professor at the university who worked with Jane for a year studying chimps in Africa..Dr. Goldman, your class will always be dope üòé"
aww,Yep. I cannot believe that it can comprehend that this is a goodbye and he is never going to see them.
aww,"I mean, that helps. You know that spot right above the tail? That's the one, baby.

My dog looks at me like she's having an orgasm sometimes."
aww,"Man, I wish I could have gotten a hug from Jane Goodall. What a wonderful woman."
aww,"‚ÄúSir I know Jane Goodall, and you are no Jane Goodall.‚Äù"

aww,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson_Safari

‚Äòthe family stumble upon a chimpanzee sanctuary maintained by the scientist Dr. Joan Bushwell (a parody of Jane Goodall). She claims to be researching the animals behavior when a group of poachers arrive to take the chimps.

The Simpsons try to hold the poachers but eventually they break into the sanctuary. The poachers are revealed to be Greenpeace activists, who prove that Dr. Bushwell is actually a chimp slave master, exploiting their labor at a nearby diamond mine‚Äô"

Congrats to your son!"
aww,Thats so beautifiul and they even let the monkey out the cage to!
aww,Who would have guessed all you needed was a silly walk?
aww,"Pretty sure it's a cultural behavior in humans, but hugging is pretty universal because it feels good."
aww,My mom had one. Said it was the best pet she ever had
aww,"There must have been so many scenarios where she must have had to stay absolutely quiet. She has more courage than I‚Äôd ever have in such situations, I‚Äôve seen documentaries on primate social interactions and footage of chimps fighting is just terrifying, so I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what Jane might have felt"

aww,"Yeah. Like, I avoid palm oil and other foods because of the impact on the environment. I know that I alone can‚Äôt really make a difference, but I still don‚Äôt feel morally comfortable giving my money to those industries."
aww,I wonder how many times the hamster would just climb out before it learned how to earn a maze reward
aww,what a beautiful face üòç her colours are awesome
aww,"&gt; what people seem to forget is that we come from primates

But just because we are descended from the same ancestor doesn't mean that we share every trait (obviously). It's totally plausible that we evolved to hug later and then were able to teach other primates that when they were in captivity."
aww,Play music over this just imagine it

If you never gave any hello hugs to begin with.

-my dads logic"
aww,What no kiss :)
aww,Thanks for the explanation. :)
aww,SPOILER ALERT HERMIONE KILLS JON SNOW!
aww,That's why the chimp hugs her. He feels sympathy for her lack of basic communication skills and assumes she's illiterate.

He also looks and acts just like our boy Bob who lived to be 16. Sometimes those walks are so hard for humans to make, but our pups live for them, dream about them, and rerun them in their dreams. You are still his human and he remembers every adventure you went on with him for six years! Good pup!"
aww,it looks wonderful! so peaceful.
aww,All ours like to be under the covers - coming home to find one of them that has tucked herself in the bed with her head on the pillow never gets old.
aww,So this is what NPH will look like in 20 years.
aww,WTF is your power bill like
aww,So we really are the dummy thicc species?
aww,Sometimes I wonder if the chimp feels freedom or abandoned.
aww,"Sounds about right. 

I think the only thing keeping the dog away from the bedroom was his being a farting snoring monster all night long. So he contained himself to his little nest of blankets."
aww,Jumkey moans would be proud

aww,Thats a thought.  It seems these dogbert brand treats went stale twenty years ago
aww,And I thought chimps are assholes.
aww,God damn it Reddit. I'm still at work. I can't be crying over here.
aww,"My old pupper had that and other things before we ended up having to put him to sleep. 21 years old, oldest dog we have ever had. He had really bad dementia later on, but I miss that dog."
aww,Did he chuck any wood?
aww,Hey it's raining in my office because my cheeks are wet. Can someone fix this?
aww,"This is beautiful, the best side of humanity, what we can be proud of. I hope this side wins out against those destroying the planet for greed and wealth. God speed little chimp may u find freedom amongst the trees."

aww,You kept training him on client side but he wanted to go sysadmin.
aww,Whate aborut the stutpid motherfricker that is stuck in 1850? Shut your mouth neckbord
aww,This is too wholesome
aww,"Have a Boston, he does this same thing with an audible sigh once tucking is finished."
aww,I think he's clearing the smells from his nose. Like when we rub our ears and for 20 seconds we can hear better. I never noticed that until this video.
aww,"Yep, though just to be clear for people here, the primary reason this particular injecting of cells from random fetal remains is not practiced in the US is because it's not a very scientifically rigorous practice from what I can tell and bordering on pseudoscience (although the overall idea isn't bad and should be studied)."
aww,I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
aww,"‚ÄúThanks for your helping me, now I‚Äôm gonna grind on you to show my appreciation.‚Äù

aww,All mutations are naturally occurring! Difference is humans deliberately breed the mutations. Do you understand that? To the detriment of the poor animals because they look cute. Ffs.
aww,"I know you're joking but there's something to be said here, I think. Assplay feels good if you know what to do.

There's really no good reason not to experiment with it, unless you hate physical pleasure or something. It isn't even like a preference thing... no more than it's preference to ""enjoy an orgasm."" It just feels good.

I think most people don't try because there's a stigma. It's ""weird,"" ""gross,"" and/or ""makes you gay."" If people are refusing to do it for reasons other than those, I have no idea what they could possibly be. Even the aforementioned reasons are all absurd."
aww,I‚Äôm actually writing a research paper on this condition. It‚Äôs awesome he seems to be doing well
aww,"I tried to like soccer and I just can't. It's sooooo boring. It's just guys running back and forth and nothing happening. 

I get why people hate American football, but Canadian football is pretty exciting. A lot more throwing the ball and a lot less running plays. 

Personally I like hockey the best though. It's fast paced and even in low scoring games there are exciting hits and amazing stops by the goalies."

aww,Looks like a hippo-deer-rat-dog
aww,"My dachshund insists on blankets as well, and a pillow, but also to be in my bed with me üòÅ he would never sleep alone, he won't even sit alone.  Has to sit behind me when I'm on the computer, inside my sweater."

aww,"I saw Jane Goodall live once and she simply commanded the entire auditorium, without trying , no gimmicks. She is amazing..."
aww,"Yeah. Sometimes it's phrased in a way that makes it sound like the chimps are intentionally trying to communicate trust and respect to the person when, in reality, I think it probably feels good to have that exposed skin rubbing against clothes and they trust that the person isn't a threat."
aww,"I am surprised that no one cared to ask about the source though?

aww,"Mine dropped four pounds from eight within a week or so. Had to basically pump her full of high cal gel,  overload her with pets, and bring out the premium bullshit or I have no doubts she would have died. She's really fluffy so we didn't know it at first, but then I felt her spine and we weighed her. Even when we caught it, she'd still fuss and look like the anti Christ  with the gel before we could turn it around. All because she was jealous of the dog. Not scared, jealous."
aww,Being a massive anus and having a massive anus are two different things
aww,"Australian Shepherd :)?
Very beautiful dog"
aww,"If I recall correctly she grabbed a PhD through a really odd path, didn't she?"

aww,Won't that hurt the cat?
aww,I'm one of the cool kids today!
aww,His smile! Love it! Well done kiddo :)
aww,I could use some kitten cuddles. This week has been crap. Pollen has my allergies out of whack and I had to proctor for the 3-8 NYS math exam. I'm spent.
aww,Do you ever treat munchkins at the supposed vet office you work at or just talk about them on the internet?
aww,Depends on what milk you use. Ice cream tends to have a fattier content which makes it creamier. Cats love the fattier stuff.
aww,pretty sure that dog just wants the treat she's hiding between her chest and legs.
aww,"I'm in the same boat, in terms of this DMD. I'm also not sure of the treatment plan in this particular case (would love to know more of the particulars). However, I am assuming that the stem cells need to be reprogrammed to differentiate into either muscle progenitor or mature muscle cells. Skin-derived iPSCs, at least in our hands, can generate a mature cell type or progenitor cell from any of the three lineages, and with incredibly high efficiency (~95%). Above all, the benefit is that the FDA can approve such iPSCs because there's a documented chain of custody and they're manufactured under GMP conditions. I'm going to study this a bit more, as I'm only now jumping into cell-based therapeutics. I'll report back if I can divine anything of note!"
aww,The look on Jane‚Äôs face during that embrace almost brought tears to my eyes. So real. What a great lady
aww,this is so sweet
aww,"I don't care about truffles, but man that sounds amazing to have the aid of an animal to find mushrooms."
aww,Nice! Where was this?
aww,"Two years ago I found a litter of baby skunks with no Mom.  I think someone trapped and killed her in the trailer court a couple blocks away.   They were about 5-6 weeks old, cutest little fuckers.  I actually ended up going there every day with tins of cat food and a few raw eggs and feeder insects, hiding them in the bushes and such, just so they had something to forage around for and eat because it was all I could think to do for the little ones. The local wildlife rescue decided not to do anything for them.  I just hope they made it.  They're pretty smart little animals and they apparently make good pets.    


My landlord wouldn't have appreciated me having an army of skunklets though."
aww,That's how drunk frat boys look like when they're at a bar trying to fight someone.
aww,Look at those adorable quack quack puppies!
aww,"Yin, a thousand times yin, not ying."
aww,"I originaly thought so to, but turns out she's an old version of the german sheepdog"

Iam doing the same and suddenly everyone looks shocked."

aww,Just remember that Republicans under Bush delayed this by a decade because of Jesus voters
aww,"""Holy shit, dude. Look at the definition on that thing. Could you imagine one of these things on DMT?"""
aww,"Nope, that's normal. It's estrus. When a female chimpanzee comes into sexual heat, her backside swells enormously and turns pink as a signal that she's sexually receptive. The same phenomenon is seen in some species of monkey but (very thankfully) among great apes is unique to chimps and bonobos."
aww,"I also seem to remember reading that it was one of her students who first witnessed conflict, and Jane didn't believe them until she saw it with her own eyes."

aww,You don‚Äôt usually ear tag pets do you?
aww,She. That is a female; you can tell by the swollen pink backside. It's a sign of estrus.
aww,So do chimps naturally associate hugging as a sign of affection or is it something they learn or mimic from us?

I dunno man I'd love for you to be the next David Attenborough talking like that hahaha"
aww,Look at the bald guy in green dress. He is like can you just enjoy yourself Mr.Chimp and also let me go home so that I can f*+king enjoy? ‚öç
aww,Now that's a lot of bull.
aww,"This is exactly the kind of positive shit I needed to see today. This kid overcame so much, my little problems mean nothing."
aww,It really is a [beautiful ](https://imgur.com/gallery/PsKgsPG)  place to live.
aww,"Awesome news, very happy for your son! I have muscular dystrophy as well, so this is cool to see. The form I have is not as aggressive as Duchenne, but it still gives me great difficulty with mobility. I‚Äôm glad to see there are more and more advancements to combat MD"
aww,"&gt; You say that til they rip your face and limbs off when they're jealous

Also feelings"
aww,"Maybe. But unless your partner doesn't know how to take care of their ass then you won't taste anything. It's a hell of a lot of fun.

Shit particles are everywhere, including your toothbrush unless you only ever flush with the lid down and keep your brush covered at all times. Dirt and germs are all over the place. No need to worry too much about it."
aww,My cat will cuddle my leg while i sleep but if there is ever a night my SO is not around she will curl up on her pillow and put a paw on my head when i sleep.
aww,That makes no sense. Lol
aww,"Changing their food is OUR choice and they're dumb bastards who think this is like the good ol days in Egypt where they ran the show and become tiny tyrants to remind us who's boss. It wasn't their choice, so clearly they must die. 

It's probably more closely caused by confinement and the fact that dry food is like a potato chip for them and they generally eat the same thing every day. Like that shitty nephew who only eats chicken nuggets from age four to fourty five. They like it and anything else is icky."
aww,"I needed this. Thanks, OP."
aww,I was worried he was going to hurt himself during that excitement
aww,"My wife must respect the shit out of me.

Who am I kidding, no one respects me."
aww,Just don't feed him after midnight!
aww,They did amazing work. True contributors.
aww,"As Phil swift says, ‚ÄúTHATS ALOT OF‚Äù *Mushrooms*"
aww,Rip. Survival of the thiccest
aww,Such an amazing woman!!
aww,"Jane has been attacked a couple of times, although the only really serious attack was by an especially aggressive dominant male called Goblin who stomped on her head so hard he almost broke her neck.


Despite their reputations for extreme aggression (and chimps *are* quite aggressive), attacks by wild chimps on humans are actually extremely rare. And those that have been habituated to humans are.....*kind of* safe to observe, provided the humans don't take provactive action. 


The biggest danger would be to small children, especially babies, that the chimps can (and, sadly, on occasion have) kill and eat."
aww,I don't blame her. That looks super cosy. üòçüòçüòç
aww,"Aww, how heartwarming. They sent the chimp off from a world where all his needs would be met and he had no predators to the wildnerness, where everything wants to kill you and you can go days without finding a bite of edible food. So, so kind.

&amp;#x200B;

:/"
aww,Look at the baby snapper
aww,Love those giant Guinea pigs.
aww,"Maybe, she cant distinguish faces..."
aww,This makes me happy
aww,Read the comments to make sure I wasn't the only one to notice the chimp had a blown out asshole.
aww,"Even if I don‚Äôt fits, I still sits."
aww,"oh wow

I would move their, but I like my rights.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: not to say you guys don't have rights, just saying I like American rights of having a gun."
aww,I must be a pregnant lady trapped in the body of a 45yo man.
aww,I also enjoy being tucked in at night. Are you accepting applications?
aww,I fear &amp; respect him
aww,"thanks, babe

Also, in the market for cat fur gloves?"
aww,Hugging releases oxytocin which is a hormone related to social bonding.
aww,"Holy SHIT, you are fucking woooooke!"
aww,"r/whatswrongwithyourdog

Edit: yes your dog is very cute"
aww,"My cats do this to me when I'm trying to put away laundry. It's adorable, but also really frustrating."
aww,he wants to smash granny!
aww,"We're in Canada. We use Celcius here! (Sorry eh, just needed to go full Canadian!)"
aww,Sometimes I wanna be a monkey.
aww,"Chimpanzees don't survive very well alone, no. He'll need to find a troop that will accept him if he's going to last. But this is probably in a nature reverse of some sort and, if they're releasing former captive animals into it, then there are probably many former captive animals here that are used to newcomers arriving."
aww,That thing ate some fermented berries
aww,Who puts a chimp in rehab?
aww,"Holy crap, that looks exactly like my dog, I guess it shouldn‚Äôt be to suprised. So you know what breed it is?"
aww,This is heartwarming but the internet has made it very hard for me to take grown adults in animal costumes seriously
aww,I have seen monkeys launch shit way too often to be comfortable face to hole with a monkeys ass as these people
aww,‚ÄúNo. Ah has not seen your watermelon. Dis one is mine.‚Äù
aww,Well at least he showed up
aww,"Chimp said ""I love you 3000"" and then left :(("
aww,Chimps and other animals are more intelligent than we think. That was nice. Thank you OP.
aww,"Chimps are our closest evolutionary cousins. They've been proven to possess the intellectual capacity to learn sign language AND to transmit that language across generations.

Read 'Next of Kin' by Roger Fouts. It's the best non-fiction book that I've ever read. The way we have treated Chimps in medical testing is awful and more people should know about what humans have done to these animals that are intelligent enough to learn how to talk to us."
aww,You should probably get that taken care of.
aww,"I didnt know this (but it would be an evolutionary disadvantage), maybe she likes the fruityness or the wateryness of strawberries."
aww,"If he‚Äôs not singing Hakuna Matata while doing this, he needs to be"
aww,They‚Äôll be in someone‚Äôs curry in a few weeks :(
aww,"Eh, you weren't going to fit your dining table in the car anyway."
aww,Looks like a Brittany mix? Beautiful pup
aww,"When a female chimp enters into estrus, her backside swells up and becomes pink as a signal that she's sexually receptive. When you're seeing a chimp with an ass that looks like this, it means that it's a female who is at or approaching heat."
aww,Ha! That facial expression is priceless! Looks like a model
aww,"While true, it is a lot of work to do raw."
aww,People didn't know where eggs came from when she was a kid? ü§î
aww,"You're really missing a trick here. 

Get some long leads on those guys, tie them to your wheelchair, and go wild through the streets shouting ""Mush! mush!"" at them."
aww,[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/2IPCymrG9hA?t=102) if you want to see how black crested macaques ask for hugs.
aww,"I didnt know this (but it would be an evolutionary disadvantage), maybe she likes the fruityness or the wateryness of strawberries."
aww,"It wasn‚Äôt mine I swear, I‚Äôm a cider drinker!"
aww,Very cool. I love monkeys
aww,Thanks for this! My first thought was that chimpanzees are pretty territorial and violent in the wild and I couldn‚Äôt imagine how a random chimp on its own was going to survive.
aww,"That‚Äôd be tough though,build a relationship like that with him then let him go,better for him of course but I‚Äôd have a hard time with it,such a great video"
aww,"They go for the balls too. So, there's that."
aww,But can they open jars though
aww,I wonder what she said right before he/she turns around and hugs her?
aww,Like a furry Dust Buster.
aww,That's not true by any means. Many vets are payed to push that science diet shit.
aww,Is this my old boss Eric?
aww,"üéµWalk off in the jungle, say goodbye to Jane.

She gave you everything you wanted honey, even gave you a name.üéµ"
aww,"Well, they do have that Quarterly Sales Goals meeting  to look forward to..."
aww,"Love, love love this.  Good Dog DAAAD!!"
aww,Kinda looks like the cat is in a party hat. Appropriate as it's your cake day - happy cake day!
aww,"Is anyone else terrified of chimpanzees, because I know I am. Ever since the story about Moe and other accidents with the more aggressive ones, I will never go near a chimpanzee in my life. Moe was a great chimpanzee but the other ones were horrific in what they did. I‚Äôm also afraid of spiders. Thank you"
aww,Only if you tell us he has a badass name
aww,"68? Man, I figured you guys keep it at like 60F up there. I keep it at 67 or 68 in the winter here, about a thousand miles south!"
aww,"They knew that it came from the chicken, but no one could tell her where the hole was/how a hen laying an egg looks like"
aww,I bet he makes a matching dent to your heart.
aww,His name is Chadwhiskers Bosemeow
aww,"It's totally fine to have your opinion and I've had that experience, too. In fact, the shelter I adopted my cat from wanted me to either feed him Royal Canin or Authority, which are low tier foods. He eats Fromm now.

I'm just pointing out that before going out and buying chicken hearts and thighs it's extremely important to get the right information. Nothing beats a raw diet, but it needs to be researched well and under the advice of a well trained vet who knows a lot about proper nutrition for a cat. Doing it wrong can be extremely detrimental to a cat's health and will lead to expensive problems down the road."
aww,I love it when a plan comes together.
aww,what did we even do to deserve jane goodall
aww,"My heart has melted while watching it... she's such a beautiful human being, animal lover and a scientist, although at the beginning despised by the science community for claiming that chimps are not only machines, res extensa, but are actually endowed with emotions and intricate, homo-sapiens like social life, ... There is a great documentary about here, called ""Jane""."
aww,That tail. I thought he was sitting on another cat at first.
aww,"I have no carpets, so I wasn‚Äôt really all that worried. Well there is one, but I bought it with the intention of letting my furry gremlins destroy it. It‚Äôs in their room after all."
aww,This dude is owning the Catwalk
aww,"Either extremely cheap or extremely expensive, depending on where they live hahaha"
aww,So all the munchkins you've supposedly (I say this because we are on the internet after all &amp; you could be full of shit like most ppl) treated are malformed &amp; have severe health problems?
aww,"We don‚Äôt come from primates. We are primates. Well.. we come from them too, I guess"
aww,Congrats!! üòÄ Must be pretty excited
aww,What a beautiful boy. So glad he found a home‚ù§Ô∏è
aww,That's veally taking things a bit too far.
aww,BOSTONS ARE THE VERY BEST OF DOGS!!! that is all.
aww,Not at the time but look at him now
aww,Albie has cold feets too!!
aww,How'd the numbers meeting go?
aww,This monkey just wasn't mining enough diamonds.
aww,Hope the other chimps didn't murder her :(
aww,"""And all these zeros in our monthly earning projection remind me of the pink butt hole of that cute chimp""

*bawling uncontrollably.*.."
aww,"Or get real cat food, like Tikicat or Merrick."
aww,They even bow their heads üòç
aww,"Fuck, that mama‚Äôs tired! Adorable pups!!"
aww,"love this, i have watched a family member regain the ability to walk against all odds.. it was and is the most awesome thing i have seen. even after their medical battle was eventually lost this memory remains with me and just fills me with indescribable joy. moments like this can last forever."
aww,"Move back please, he's precious. Just lost one that looked just like that"
aww,"Ok, so legit question. I've always heard that you never *ever* want to smile at chimps, because they take it as you baring your teeth, and it tends to make them extremely aggressive.

Yet the second that chimp turns around, that one lady gets down at his level and starts smiling a big toothy smile.

Someone like Ms. Goodall would obviously know what she's doing, and probably have similar staff. So, what gives?"
aww,"that cat food as a lot of other things that aid in nutrition, not *just* meat. obviously some canned food is far better than other canned foods.

also i hope you cook that chicken because feeding him raw chicken is a recipe for disaster."
aww,"So that's how hot dogs are made, they always told me I wouldn't want to know but they're wrong"
aww,"Hi Andy!! 
My Luke has the same harness. We love EcoBark!"
aww,Do they have a sub for things that make you cry like r/mademesmile counterpart
aww,This is why you use two factor authentication. You don‚Äôt lay down until proper verification.
aww,"Wow. This sounds just like my maine coon. 
(Except he‚Äôs a boy)

Although he does like cod that‚Äôs baked in the oven in tin foil so that it‚Äôs full of juice. 

.. As in, he‚Äôs really only interested in the juice."
aww,Jane is such a wonderful woman
aww,"I'm not crying, you're crying."

aww,He seems to have something on his mind...
aww,"why are people still stationed in afganistan? what else is left to do to that country? what a crap way to make a living, i feel sorry for these people who sign up to serve their country and sent for a year away from their families making absolutely no difference in a fucked up place. could have spent a year shoring up levies south."

aww,Thanks. Downvoting to make this second to last comment
aww,Where the fuck is the Joe Rogan quote/take on how mean and dangerous chimps are??
aww,Pull it up Jamie.
aww,"That was something I was worried about, which is why he spent as much time as possible with his herd and he went to live with them full time as early as possible. He‚Äôs about 3 now, and does have personal space issues (he‚Äôll jump on you, try to nip at your ankles). We think having him ‚Äúfixed‚Äù might be able to help as well, now that he‚Äôs old enough. Otherwise we try to avoid letting people into their enclosure, just in case."
aww,No Robert Sapolsky? For shame
aww,Seymour is never gonna believe this.
aww,Really dude? You don't deserve those 69 upvotes.
aww,"I mean, she's still creating her legacy.

There is a Master Class you can take that is taught by her, [Dr. Jane Goodall Teaches Conservation](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/jane-goodall-teaches-conservation).

According to the [The Jane Goodall Institute](https://janegoodall.org/) she is still spreading the word about conservationism and climate change as she travels, on average, 300 days per year üò≤!

&gt; Dr. Jane Goodall went into the jungles of Tanzania to study wild chimpanzees and share their stories. She left the jungle to become an activist ‚Äì to protect those chimps and work with people to improve lives while opening minds and hearts.
&gt; 
&gt; Now, she donates her time to the Jane Goodall Institute, traveling on average up to **300 days per year**‚Ä¶."
aww,So not very different from humans
aww,"I mean, it's very cute and everything, but I really don't think it knew that it was a goodbye hug... It looked more like it needed comforting because it was a bit freaked out."

aww,Beautifully constructed mazes! And satisfying conclusion.
aww,"When we brought my cat home from the shelter 15 years ago, she was also enthralled by a [watermelon](https://imgur.com/a/B7QQY8n)."
aww,"not really. dogs can eat some fruits as healthy treats but cats are really bred to get all of their nutrients from meat. if your cat likes fruit (so long as it's not dangerous!) then by all means, give him/her some as treats, just don't overdo it."
aww,That can‚Äôt possibly be true. Is that why the US fought a war there?
aww,Totally! I was thinking the same thing.
aww,ü§î I don't knoww...mein kampfidence in you is lacking.
aww,Yeah its too bad she sucked as a real scientist and put too much effort into being friends with them instead of studying them in the wild.

aww,"I feel like there would probably be a lot of (non US I guess) medical researchers who would love to do case studies of people like your son. In terms of dismissing concerns a bunch of case studies are not as good as a full trial, but they sure go a long way."

aww,"yes, but the comment i had originally replied to suggested getting a package of chicken thighs instead of cat food, which is not enough."
aww,"I just want to add as a BT owner, they sometimes just love to be burrowed. Hot. Cold. Doesn‚Äôt matter. Ours will do everything she can to borrow beneath blankets to get comfortable."

aww,Okay just don‚Äôt thank any more kind strangers lol
aww,That hug got me good. :'( Jane Goodall is such an amazing person!
aww,Not sure if trolling or not; but due to the brilliant red coloring on its throat.  The rest of the plumage is primarily green.

aww,RIP in peace you just murdered that fool

Somehow, somewhere, a scientist:""Challenge accepted!"""
aww,Ok why is this video doesn't have sounds in it
aww,"It‚Äôs the same as dachshunds. In youth they‚Äôre (typically) healthy but they don‚Äôt age well because of the way they are physically. Their shape tends to put more stress on their joints and back which takes its toll. This happens as most animals age but it‚Äôs quicker and typically worse in animals of that shape (corgis, dachshunds, etc). This can cause a lot of different conditions that are treated differently. There is a condition that munchkins are prone to where the spinal muscles dont grow properly and the spine doesnt have enough support. Aside from obvious issues this raises, the spine may also can press on other organs if it‚Äôs severe enough. 
All this being said, munchkins are healthier than most other purebreds (by what extent I don‚Äôt know), I just compulsively shit on purebred anything at this point. If two short legged munchkins were bred together, all the kittens would die as they would be homozygous positive for the short leggedness which is lethal. So when breeding munchkins, a normal legged cat is always one of the parents, so the gene pool isn‚Äôt completely full of recessiveness."
aww,So I noticed your house smells like feces

aww,"In the 60s, when we were just learning about primates, a group of researchers adopted a baby primate to live with a family so she could be studied.  The chimp lived like a human, dressing in human clothes, using human household appliances, sleeping in a bed.  She learned to communicate through sign language.  When the family had company over, the chimp would pour everyone a drink and serve it.  

They then decided to release her back into the wild.  The chimp had never slept in the wild before or eaten food from the wild.  She did not want to leave her family and she did not want to assimilate into the wild.  Someone stayed with her for a couple weeks until they saw her eating independently in the wild.  They then left her.  They returned a couple years later to see if she still remembered them and she did.  They also brought her a hair brush and mirror that she used to use when she lived with her humans.  She remembered these items too and it brought back painful memories - since it reminded her of the home she lost. 

The researches checked in on her again about a year later but they didn't find her.  They suspect she had fallen prey to scalpers.

aww,Highly unlikely.  They don‚Äôt have opposable thumbs.

aww,Why? This fat cat got a hug first and everything.
aww,"Hey!  If you don't mind, can I ask you a couple of questions?  I've asked my own vet some of these questions, but I'd like a second opinion.

* I've heard even the best dry food is worse than the worst wet food.  Is that true?
* Do you have any suggestions for ingredients to avoid in cat food?  My vet pretty much said as long as it has taurine it's fine... I'm not really satisfied with that answer.
* Having fed my cats mostly wet food to this point in their life, I'm mildly concerned about their dental hygiene.  My vet recommended I brush their teeth 3x a week, but for various reasons... it doesn't happen.  (Yes, shame on me)  I've heard raw bones (cooked are choking hazard) and wheatgrass are good for naturally keeping their teeth cleaner.  Any thoughts on that?
* Any thoughts on buying frozen mice for cats?"
aww,"I got it wrong! Thora is on the left and Dawn on the right, I was confused because Dawn is bigger and Thora looks like the older one in this pic."

I will enjoy every step I take a little more, cherish that I can walk, something I took for granted, but now I got remembered that it is indeed a gift. I am happy for your courage in doing the therapy and happy for him. You rock as a parent. I wish you all the best. Congratulations on your steps, son of redditor.

She will NOT fall asleep with her head pointed up toward the top of the bed though, when she gets sleepy she gets up, turns around and lies against my side facing my feet. If I don't pet her belly, she grabs my hand with her paws and makes me pet her."
aww,Unless your cat is allergic to chicken...and it‚Äôs more common than you think. My cat licked half the fur off his body before we figured it out...

aww,Have they ever torn through the tent?
aww,"Every Boston I‚Äôve ever met has been super weird, and also awesome."
aww,"Basically. I think this commenter is referring to the swelling though‚Äîfemale chimps and bonobos (and some other primates) have sexual swellings like the one you see on this individual, size and color changes depending on the female‚Äôs cycle. It‚Äôs a very easy way for males to tell whether or not she‚Äôs fertile and if they should try to mate."
aww,Watching him go through this journey has really changed how I look at things. Sometimes I get so annoyed that I have to carry my groceries up the stairs.

aww,"dont feel bad, think mines about teabagging or somin

Edit: NM it was about spawn camping newborns."
aww,This is so sweet! I don't know why but my male cats mother wasn't very attentive and often left him and her other kittens alone while going outside every night. This lead to my friends and me taking care of all those kittens while they were able to find their forever homes. Now he is 3 years old and NEVER cleans himself. It's not a huge problem but it gets really annoying when I have to scrape his butt while I am expecting visitors and don't want him to stick it into their faces.
aww,"Oh, that's the recipe I had been considering making for my cats!  Sounds like you're pretty happy with it.  Are there any thoughts you would share about it to someone who might be on the fence about trying it?"

aww,"Jamie's aunt here üòÅ -

In this particular case, he got four injections in his stomach, one in his IV. They were given no guarantee when they signed up for the treatment, but considering the only other option is to be on lots of meds in hopes it just prolongs his life while he continues to lose muscle function, it was worth a try. They did lots of research and saw enough stories with happy endings to make them take the leap. And, based on his improved heart health almost immediately, along with his ability to now stand, it was well worth it! As far as further treatment, it's more like a see-what-happens kind of thing. They'll continue to monitor Jamie's muscle function, and if they feel like another treatment will benefit him, they will try to make that happen."
aww,Those are all incredible people. It may not seem obvious but you can tell those men are so touched by their work as well.

aww,"Last year there were baby skunks (and the mama skunk) in my neighborhood, and would frequently pass by my front door. Fun fact, skunks have really poor vision and have a habit of just walking right up to people without noticing. 

One day I was standing outside my apartment when the momma skunk rounded the corner and started booking toward me. She was already closer to the door than I was, cutting off my only retreat. Faced with the threat of being sprayed with unholy foulness, I used the only tool I had at my disposal.

Manners.

""Uhm... Excuse me..."" I said to the skunk. She froze in place, looked at me, raised her tail, but backed up and took off.  I got the impression that the skunk was embarrassed to have intruded. 

This happened multiple times before animal control managed to trap them all. I recommend this if you're ever faced with a short sighted skunk and have nowhere to back away slowly to."

His favorite thing seems to be to jump on the bed at night, walk up and down on me, bite my toes and then settle down next to me.  Not touching, mind you, just nearby.  He also has the same way of looking at me as this ginger boy."
aww,"Yeah, in general we should cherish a lot more stuff that seems ""normal"" to us. You are very welcome and deserve all the kind words there are.

aww,"Primate diets vary widely, with some eating only insects, some carnivores, some frugivores, some folivores, many omnivores. Chimp meat intake also varies depending on the location. In one forest in Uganda, there‚Äôs such a large chimp population that species of colobus monkey have been extirpated (extinct from the area) from so many chimps hunting them. This is likely due to a mix of high population and high density as well as culture.

aww,"The dog doesn‚Äôt insist on getting tucked-in, it insists on getting a treat for doing this after being trained to do so."
aww,"I guess what I was getting at is they might not need any reprogramming if they're already at the muscle progenitor stage in the fetus. They just need to be isolated so in their case, it's easier to use the multi-potent fetal cells than having to reprogram pluripotent cells. That's about all I know in that area though. I know the iPSC world well after working with them for a few years and there's definitely an exciting future there. I wouldn't be surprised if we had 1 degree of separation between us considering how small this part of biotech is!"

aww,"I definitely understand that! I brought one in once &amp; he became the greatest pet/friend ever. Of course, he was a baby at the start. Sadly he died after a year from an incurable illness he probably already had when his mom dumped him (according to vet hospital), but it was awesome until then."
aww,The rainforests aren't under the protection of the United States. Poverty stricken socialists in South America are going to continue deforesting until there is nothing left.

aww,"So, what do they do if the chimp doesn‚Äôt leave? (i.e. it doesn‚Äôt want to be released.)"

aww,Whaaaaa??! TIL there's a name for that thing that makes me clench my teeth at puppies and kittens and such. Thanks!
aww,‚ÄòTis a good life lesson
aww,"So basically you're already biased because you ""think"" they are going to have problems. Most info out there on this breed is anecdotal at best. Also, the homozygous thing is not completely true. Some kittens 'may' have 2 copies of the munchkin gene &amp; will not even develope, which results in smaller litters. The spine ""issue"" is called lordosis, which some cats are prone to. Again, there is zero evidence that Munchkins are more prone to the problem than any other breed. Also, most spinal problems are evident at birth &amp; while there were early speculations that Munchkins will develop spinal problems commonly seen in short legged dog breeds, this has yet to be proven."
aww,"I admire her waiting for the chimp to decide it wanted to come to her. She knew this was its big moment, and gave it the space it needed until it was ready to say goodbye"
aww,Jane Goodall? You mean that one lady from 7th grade?
aww,Shes one of the good ones. She doesnt do good for attention either. She couldnt care less about attention. She just has her passion and lives by it every day making a difference. I have so much respect for her and others like her. Like the Doctors without Boarders kind of people.
aww,"She‚Äôs being released onto an island owned by the sanctuary, she‚Äôs been upgraded from the normal sanctuary enclosures to this semi-wild one. There is already a group of semi-wild chimps here, who are closely monitored and still given medical attention, but at this point are pretty much left alone. They were provisioned when they first got there, but now newly released ones can just learn how to find food from the others."

aww,"&gt; they're aliens all of a sudden

Sounds pretty unlikely.  Really not my area but I don't know anything about them that suggests that they're anything other than earth biota (composition, genetics, nutritional and environmental requirements).  They sure are weird, and cool.  

We may not know much about their evolutionary lineage (I don't know) but it wouldn't be surprising.  Given how generally poor the fossil record is for most anything, it's amazing we know as much as we do."

aww,This man puts out fire with gasoline
aww,My neighbors had a yellow lab that knew I was a 'dog guy'.  She loved to run to me for pets and leg rubbing if she caught me coming home from work.  Many a suit covered with hair.  Many years later I gave her my last pets in her final bed.  Old dogs especially like the love from people.

Duchess would go ears back and low growl if someone cut open a cantalope near her.  You had to give her a slice, or she'd be in your lap eating yours, ears back, chomping the melon as fast as she could.  

Queenie on the other hand, was a Chonk, and she'd lazily sleep on the top of the back of Dad's recliner.  If you sat in that chair, eating sour cream and onion chips, a lightning fast grey paw would snap the chip out of your hand as you were about to eat it.  She'd then proceed to lick all the flavor dust off the chip, and spit the spent soggy chip behind the chair.  She also would go nuts for Cool Ranch Doritos."

aww,"No way man. You don't even believe that, if you did, why are you living in a society of humans when there are jungles, savannas and woods and forests filled with all kinds of animals you deem ""better""? Why don't you live with them?

It's just like antibiotic use creating superbugs - the problem is the vast majority of inappropriate antibiotic use ISNT at the individual level - it's at the enterprise level. Same for waste creation.

yes, those problems can happen in other breeds but many vets have found correlations in those problems and the short legged mutation. 
whether something has been ‚Äúproven‚Äù or not depends on your definition. the munchkin breed is relatively new and in the scientific community, for something to be ‚Äúproven‚Äù and accepted, normally takes years and years of research, peer reviews, etc. however, when many experts (in this case vets) agree on something it can be presumed as true. just like there are no studies proving the correlation, there are none disproving it so i take the word of vets.

Occasionally you'll see her doing a little bit, but we have to clean her or she gets really matted fur. She also will sleep in pretty much any position. If you put her on her back she'll just fall asleep and lay like that for a long time (she'll sleep like that by herself too). She also loves belly rubs."

aww,"We used to have a dog with half of his muzzle gone. It was healed over but his tongue hung out of it. My bros named him Stogy cuz it looked like he had a cigar in his mouth. Lol We found him on the back roads where we used to live. We didn't want to bring him home because he was so ugly, &amp; we had 4 other dogs, but we went by everyday to feed him. It was on our way to my school. We kept hoping someone else would see him &amp; take him home. Then one day it was Thanksgiving &amp; we went to feed him &amp; he couldn't move. He had tick paralysis. We brought him home &amp; fixed him up &amp; kept him. He would eat our chickens though so we had to keep him tied up which we hated to do but had no other choice because he was ravenous. He'd eat the whole bird; beak, feathers, feet, everything, if he could get to them. I thought maybe he had jumped out of a truck &amp; got his face messed up or something but now that I'm older I think maybe he was a 'bait' dog for dog fighting as it was prevalent where we lived. He at least had a good life after we got him &amp; never went hungry again."
aww,"While it is cheaper to buy JUST chicken at the store for your cat, it is about the same cost if you properly buy all of the supplements involved in making cat food which includes b vitamins, taurine, vitamin E and fish oil as well as making sure you're buying chicken liver/hearts and grinding up the bones for them to eat. You have to buy a high quality meat grinder, as well as go through the grueling process of preparing raw food and keeping everything sanitary.   


For a year I made my cat raw food and I stopped because if I ran out of food it really sucked, it was a painstaking process, and I couldn't afford a $1000 meat grinder that could reliably grind up bones for longer than a couple of months without breaking. As well as the icky-factor of handling large quantities of raw chicken. I actually made sure to give him everything I listed in the previous paragraph so I'm fairly certain I wasn't harming him, but giving my cat just chicken seems like a horrible idea.   


I'm really surprised this comment has over 700 upvotes. This is the kind of crap I'd expect an anti-vaxx mom to share on FB after watching one ""documentary"" on the dangers of commercial cat food. Chicken is a fine treat/ snack but it is not a well-balanced diet."

aww,"&gt; Shit like this is exactly why I do and don't want a bird...  

Reminds me of an old parrot joke.  I had to google it and copy/pasta as I didn't want to type it all out, so here it is:  

A woman goes into a pet shop looking for a parrot. The assistant shows her a beautiful African Grey parrot. ""What about this one, Madam? A beautiful bird, I'm sure you'll agree, and it's an absolute steal at only $20."" ""Why is it that cheap?"" the woman asks. ""Well"", replies the assistant, it used to live in a brothel and as a result its language is a touch fruity"" ""Oh, I don't mind that"", said the woman, making her mind up, ""I'm broad minded and it'll be a laugh having a profane parrot"". So saying, she buys the parrot and takes him home.

Once safely in his new home, the parrot looks around and squawks at the woman ""**** me, a new brothel and a new madam"" ""I'm not a madam and this Isn't a brothel"" says the woman indignantly. A little later the woman's two teenage daughters arrive home. ""A new brothel, a new madam, and now new prostitutes"" says the parrot when he sees the daughters. ""Mum, tell your parrot to shut-up, we're not prostitutes"" complained the girls, but they all see the funny side and have at laugh at their new pet.

A short while later, the woman's husband comes home. ""Well **** me, a new brothel, a new madam, new ######, but the same old clients. How ya doin', Dave?""  

At any rate; the point I wish to make is that you should practice caution in front of your parrot.  If you don't want it repeated; do NOT say it.  

(There's also a video out there of a parrot ordering things via Alexa in its owner's voice; so there's that, too.)"

I think any one who watched it should be banned from the internet/reddit till every other one watch it :p. Bullet proof anti-spoiler protection."
aww,"I see just as many vets ""presume"" it not to be true.. So, yeah, you won't change my mind. If they are bred responsibly, ie genetic testing, etc, there will be less problems. This is true of any breed or species. As to them being new, there were reports of Munchkins in other parts of the world in the 40s. The first established Munchkins in the US were in the 80s, then they were a TICA accepted breed in 1994 &amp; achieved championship status in 2013. Maybe the breed is newer but def not 'new'....btw you never stated that you actually ""treat"" any Munchkins or other short legged breeds at your vet so I'm not sure you know anymore about then than what you've read on the internet."

aww,"I took in a four week old feral who turned out to have some birth defects. I put a little shallow pan of litter in the bathroom with her and she never once has gone outside of it. Cats are good about not going where they shouldn't.

Unless it's my old cat. He was a jerk and did it on purpose. He pooped in a hallway, peed on clothes if you left them in one bathroom but nowhere else. He also would poop in the tub if we left the glass shower door open. There was no pattern. Clean litterbox? Dogs outside? Poop in hallway.

Lil Taco Cat has been litterbox pooping and peeing since day one and she was a half-starved, scared little feral baby in a woodpile that tried to claw the crap out of me in her terror at being captured by giants. I had leather gloves and trapped her except her head was poking out. Not a happy baby for about 24 hours. Then she realized I would snuggle and pet her and had an endless supply of kitten milk and food."
aww,There is a company called Athersys that is working on this for stroke victims. The crazy thing is that their therapy specifically is actually quite likely to work well for victims that get to the hospital within 36hrs of having the stroke and is already known to be safe and show efficacy if given in the right timeframe. They are in the last stage of trials and have a whole community dedicated to the company over at r/ATHX . If all goes well they‚Äôll have approval as soon as next year in Japan and around 2021 in the US. Exciting stuff and congrats to your kid!

aww,Escaped the stranglehold of highly addictive drugs. A lucky man.
aww,"Sure we have developed. BUT what I mean is that we pride ourselves to be logical and so smart and above animals. Yet so many things we do are based on instinct and not logic at all. So our behaviours are often still dominated by those underlying reflexes and instincts, even when we try to rationalize them. There is no rational reason why we hug, we do it because it makes us *feel* good. Which is pure biology that is engrained in us since we were primates. Isn't that fascinating."

aww,That's a pretty realistic looking hologram
aww,"Friends of mine have a kitty like this, they named him Harvey!"
aww,"I don‚Äôt considered them a breed until they belong to a group (TICA, like you said) as there is no regulation in breeding until then. munchkins probably were found in the 40s like you said, but unless they were specifically bred for theyre just mutated cats, not a breed. compared to most breeds, the 90s is new for a recognized breed. most breeding isnt ethical as most breeding conforms to standards set by an organization which almost always correlate with health issues. for example, the sloped back in german shepherds. we treat whatever breed of cat/dog is brought in, which includes short legged breeds. if you expect me to list every single time i have helped a vet do a physical, x ray, or any other form of treatment on a short legged breed, i cant, because its too many to recall. sorry. 
i havent met any vets who dont have an issue with munchkins, bulldogs, dachunds and other abnormally mutated animals, good for you that you have."

aww,Which one are you talking about?
aww,"Oh yeah, it‚Äôs in soap and shampoo and like everything. Should have worded it that I avoid palm oil AND certain food products. 

The movement to get rid of disposable straws and plastic bags is good, but let‚Äôs not pretend that corporations aren‚Äôt doing 100x more damage a day. It‚Äôs a start, but it‚Äôs not going to have any real change if we stop there and don‚Äôt start pressuring corporations. They don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre destroying the environment, because they‚Äôre rich and old enough to ride out the continuing collapse in comfort while the lower class and younger generations suffer."
aww,"I just reach down and wiggle the fat belly of this cat we try to get to exercise more and use my fingers to wiggle and jiggle his fat belly and go, ""bluluhluluhluh"" and make weird noises to shame him and his fatness. He lets me get a few in before claws extend. He's really bad at catting and I can escape without damge. He's not a very good cat. Pretty sure that time he started limping was him falling off a fence. He's almost and/ or been confirmed to have fallen off cat trees, walls, fences and tables. Fat, slow, graceless, useless cat. Every other indoor/ outdoor kitty brought home trophies. He brought us a dirty dishrag he stole from... somewhere.

Lately he's been fatter and less cat than usual so I snag him off the fence so he can't leave the yard. Adult supervision, only. He tries to escape but I catch him. Fatty."

aww,Why would you want to return it?
aww,"Agreed, you can tell at the end the dogs are like ""Do we still have to do this?"" on their faces looking for direction. The cat? Tired maybe?"
aww,"As someone who has live in Singapore and has been to Sumatra when they burn the palm oil plantations so badly that the air is unbreathable for 3-4 months a year, fuck palm oil. Rainforest is the most valuable forest we have because it is the highest in biodiversity, it produces the most oxygen, and we have soooo little of it left. I would use canola oil every time over palm oil regardless of the production efficiency of palm oil. We need to take every measure possible to try and stop them from further destroying the sumatran and borneo rainforests. The palm oil industry is morally bankrupt."

Had.

Until Dandelion came to live with us. He was a very sweet cat, but he *destroyed* the chipmunk population within a handful of years. It was around 20 years ago now but the chipmunk population is only just now starting to bounce back, according to my stepdad."

aww,"Ugh, not me. I had an apartment invaded by mice once. It was nightmarish; they could literally make a psychological horror film about a mouse infestation and it would be horrifying. You hear them skitter in the walls at night, find their poop on your pillow, computer, every surface in your kitchen even though you have everything in Tupperware. 

No humane traps work, so you have to be a monster and use glue traps. My landlord was lazy and wouldn‚Äôt call an exterminator, even though the couple literally lived in the apartment below mine! They had two cats though so maybe the mice avoided them? 

They were so fast! And even if you did manage to catch one, there‚Äôs something horrifying about killing another mammal for me. If it‚Äôs a bug, I can squish it no problem. Mice are definitely worse!"

I recall a video on here with a crab swim-spinning in circles in a very small enclosure. Because it was bored and needed stimulation of some kind. With its overgrown insect brain, it needed that."
aww,Is this a setup for Marvel version of John Wick??
aww,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (I have two pit rescues we saved from a dog fighting ring) You are doing a wonderful act giving this beautiful boy a happy home.
aww,Lemmiwinks made it! Three cheers for Lemmiwinks!
aww,Yeah I'm one of those dog owners that don't do fun stuff like that. Maybe cause I didn't grow up with dogs so when I got my dog I was paranoid that I would accidentally kill him kinda like having a baby. I just like bake him treats that have ingredients that are really safe for dogs and use natural sugars like bananas. I do feel bad that he never gets to eat the trash I eat one time he stole a grill cheese sandwich when he was a puppy lmao
aww,This is so amazing! I used to be a camp counselor every summer for MDA camp over 16 years ago. For a child to be able to walk again is nothing short of miracle.

aww,"She's cute. She isn't often very ""cuddly"" except for bedtime cuddles and when I just get home from work. But she always keeps an eye on me to make sure I'm safe while I'm home. She makes up excuses to be close to me, and keep me in eyesight. She'll walk by my computer chair and just stop to sniff at something while she's conveniently within petting range and if I don't notice she'll gently headbutt my leg and then pretend she was just trying to sneak by. She sits outside the bathroom door, facing away from the door to keep watch and make sure nothing attacks me while I'm vulnerable. I love my kitty, and she loves me too (though she doesn't like to admit it)"

aww,"Cats need more than muscle meat in order to survive. Hearts give taurine which they cannot produce themselves, which is important, but for feeding purposes hearts count as muscle meat.

They need an 80/10/10 ratio of muscle meat, bone, and secreting organs (5% liver, rest pancreas and kidneys.

Hare Today is a wonderful raw feeding company. Their website also has plenty of proper raw feeding links.

What you are feeding your cat currently is NOT appropriate. Please do your research.

aww,They jump. They hop. They run and pop!!
aww,"Not only that, but running pell-mell through the countryside strikes me as a decent way of getting yourself killed.  Spent time living with foragers in an area with big cats, it focuses the attention.  The ones these days mostly keep to themselves but back before they learned to be wary, lions (and others) must have been a constant concern.  Just a thought but I'm guessing moving cautiously would be far more prudent."

aww,"I don't know what the ""not a saint"" stuff is about, because I've never heard anything personal about Goodall, but wiki has a decent rundown on [criticisms of her methodologies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Goodall#Criticism) Some of the criticisms are IMO more about the time period than anything legitimate (for instance, Goodall giving the chimps she observed names rather than numbers is more about how people did this kind of work in the '60s than anything else.) But potentially more valid criticisms include: that she uses human concepts to talk about chimps, which may be misleading; that she didn't just observe, but introduced some types of interaction via the use of feeding stations; and that the feeding stations may have caused more aggression among the chimps than is normally seen in the wild. 

I don't think any of those things are unforgivable. If you look at animal science when Goodwall was coming up, it's pretty whack and bears very little resemblance to our current understandings. I mean, there are multiple cases of researchers developing such close relationships to animals that the animals tried to fuck them. There are multiple instances of people trying to teach animals how to communicate in spoken English. Goodall's methodology probably does have issues, but probably less so than many of her contemporaries."

aww,"Eh I read the full synopsis the day before I saw it and I still loved it. Spoilers really shouldn't impact how you feel about a movie. If the story is well written and the visuals are on point then it's good. Knowing where the journey will end and how you get there shouldn't affect your trip.

I'm well aware I'm weird and in the minority on this one."

Pigs are naturally drawn to them and were known to bite their handlers when they tried to pull them away.

aww,"Rats are unable to vomit.

&gt;Biologically, a rat is unable to vomit because of a powerful and effective gastroesophageal barrier,¬†[research shows](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1026678820384). This barrier consists of crural sling, the esophageal sphincter, and the intra-abdominal esophagus. Researchers found that the pressure at the two ends of this barrier is greater than the pressure found in the thorax during any phase of the breathing cycle. This pressure, thus, makes it impossible for rats to reflux.

https://www.zmescience.com/science/rats-cant-vomit/

 For this reason, they are extremely suspicious of new foods and will only nibble a little bit before waiting a day or two to see if it makes them ill. If they get ill after a test nibble, or if they see another rat fall ill, they will not eat from that food source."

Edit In response to it not having a collar: Could have easily fallen off since cat collars are made to snap off in the event the cat gets tangled.

Mother cat nursed them but died shortly after from complications, (don't worry mom cat was a fucking bitch)  but her kittens, all they knew how to do was love.  I had 2 of them.  My mom had 1.

EVERYTHING... and so it is with dogs. When you get home and you are too tired to walk them, just think... That is all they get... And to them... Or means soooo much... It is your responsibility. I hate seeing dogs tied to trees... If you are going to toe your dog to a tree for his whole life... Then don't get a dog, unless it is putting it to sleep, or the tree, but if it is the tree... Try just one in a while to give that dog a little more. Invite the neighbors kids (if they are old enough, and the dog won't bite) to walk it once in a while... Do SOMETHING!"

I use to feed them only super premium (hills science indoor diet) but axel has a sensitive tummy and was getting gastrointestinal infections a lot and when I studied vet nursing my holistic vet taught me about raw and I‚Äôve only had 1 incident in 2 years now and that was cause he found a old bone they stored somewhere (still to this day have yet to find that spot.)
My boys get trained twice a day for 5min each but if they‚Äôre still focused and into it/enjoying themselves then I‚Äôll extend it up to 10min but definitely no more, they average 8min and then show they‚Äôve had enough.

aww,"I know this is late, but one of my sweet kitties does something similar, but until you mentioned that he doesn't stay I hadn't put it together with my cat.  She sits on my arm under the covers and then bolts after about 15 minutes.  I guess I need to be more patient."
aww,That man is living his best life
aww,I love this so much
aww,Good dog. MOOOOOOOmmmmYYYYYYYY I want ITTTTT
aww,"I thought you meant it took you two minutes and twenty seconds to build the maze. I was super impressed when I saw level one but when I saw level two, I was really confused. I think I figured it out on level three."

aww,I love this.... but why are the kitties pupils so little in the tattoo? That's the best part of his/her sweet little face.
aww,I never knew bunnies screamed....üò¨
aww,I need this in my life
aww,"What are you crying about?  All the comments aside from like 2 are people being helpful trying to tell you they do breathe with lungs, or a lung in this case, which I just learned myself from this thread.  You're acting like you're being attacked in the comments, I don't even think one person straight called you stupid, and if they did, so what, fuck them, at least 10 people tried to nicely inform you about snakes breathing, maybe they didn't see the other people's comments before they left one, I only saw one, and the rest were hidden until I expanded it.  Just because multiple people say the same thing or respond to one comment doesn't mean they're trying to be mean, or call you out, they're just trying to help."
aww,"And one way to pressure corporations is by not buying their products and sharing with others how buying their products puts money in the pockets of people causing destruction.  Cut off the demand, they reduce the supply."
aww,"I love that cats think humans are dumb kittens. 
Dogs recognise we‚Äôre a different animal and love us anyway.
Cats think we‚Äôre the same as them, but stupid. Cat meows are ‚Äòbaby talk‚Äô like when we put on stupid baby voice, that‚Äôs cats meowing at us. when cats communicate with each other we can‚Äôt hear it. 
When they bring you dead animals, it‚Äôs because they think you can‚Äôt feed yourself, they think you‚Äôre stupid, so they‚Äôre bringing you food because they think you need it and can‚Äôt hunt for yourself. 
Try giving your pet a bit of raw meat occasionally. It‚Äôll know you can hunt and might stop bringing you murder presents"
aww,Aw look at the little babeys!!!
aww,"Oh they totally are. My mum, who teaches in an elementary school, went to a tour organized by the school to a place full of deers. They were so cuddly and playful, kids loved them, until one of the deers smelled one kids potato chips and snuck his snot in the bag. After that all the other deers did the same and all hell broke loose. The kids were behaving more like animals than the deers after that."
aww,"Awww indeed, the panther is cute too ;-)"
aww,"Aw I wish I could take mine to the shops.. we go to cafes with the dog, parks and the dog beaches but at quiet times so there isn‚Äôt a lot of dogs there if any at all. I worry about other dogs at the beach cause not all are fine with cats and dogs and we‚Äôve had a close call once, axel and Cody were with my mum up on the sand cause he only likes showers and Cody hates water but Draco loves swimming and a dog come sprinting into the water and tried to attack Draco, I hand raised both my boys so I‚Äôm extra protective of them and I all but had a heart attack, poor Draco got flung 10ft (not quite) into the air by me so the dog didn‚Äôt grab him. Took me a month of visits every few days to get him ok with the beach again."

aww,"This is a pet peeve of mine. Unless the cat is obviously neglected, don't steal someone's pet."
aww,"You‚Äôre right, corporations don‚Äôt have a conscience, they just supply what we demand. So really we need to stop demanding the harmful products from them. Otherwise they have zero incentive to stop producing them. This takes individual change. On a large scale. So do right and spread awareness."
aww,"Wow, it‚Äôs criminal that this isn‚Äôt more readily available as treatment"

aww,Happy Cake Day my friend!
aww,I feel the exact same way.
aww,"I'm talking about BEFORE the product hits the shelves. corporations will just hide gross-but-legal behavior if it's profitable to continue doing so. The trick is to make killing the planet more expensive than being stewards of the environment. once you get to the consumer choice stage of things, it's often too late.

Chocolate and coffee are still mostly procured by slave and/or child labor, despite fair trade labels being en vogue. It turns out it's easy to lie and slap a feel-good label on products. Lots of people buy vegan products that - surprise- use palm oil instead of the animal products they're seeking to avoid (which causes more harm to animals thru habitat destruction). companies market to consumers with feel-good labels. we need something systemic and with teeth if we are to make a meaningful change.

And please note - i say we need this and i mean IN ADDITION TO and not just instead of ""doing right"" on an individual level."
aww,"And with the ""They won't use their claws, we promise"" premium upgrade, you could get that easily above 150."

aww,It's just how she roles.
aww,"You seem to be implying that chicken is cheap in America so that poor people can buy it, but is there any evidence of that? I would naturally have assumed it's cheap because as others pointed out, the looser regulations allow ranches to make more profit on each head. Combine that with vast agro (and specifically chicken) subsidies and it seems like the point is profit, not feeding poor people."
aww,That dog is like ‚ÄúYeah I found these... what of it?!?‚Äù
aww,"Cute dog, can we see more of the guy."
aww,Awww cutie pie. Hope it wasn‚Äôt anything too traumatic.

aww,"Where I am in Michigan, they show up on my back yard every couple of years or so. I stopped aggressively raking and fertilizing, as well as letting the indigenous plants and milkweed establish themselves several years ago and started finding them. They're quirky. I live in the city, so it's even nicer. I don't pick them -- I'm hoping that letting them spread their spores might give them a better toehold."
aww,I can't resist such a handsome guy. Hello Sully!

But whatever, the movie was unforgettable for so many reasons."
aww,"First thought.... get to comments, sure enough top comment. man so sick and tired of that happening."
aww,"Please do show me where I ""admitted"" to not cleaning my counter.

I love how every person so far that has gotten bent out of shape is obviously guilty of not controlling their animals and is reacting defensively.

Making excuses for animals walking around on food prep/consumption areas is just absolute lazy pet ownership. And please, for the love of god, spare me the ""well golly, ya just can't train cats amirite?"" load."

aww,"I had a cat who was the best lap cat ever. I mean, he was a great lap cat when old but he was always a lap cat. He was pretty big, white with brown/tan blotches and a nice striped tail. He knew when something was up and he would always cuddle with me and lick my hair. He even put his paw around my neck. He died two years ago. He was 18 which I think is great for a cat, especially considering how he wasn‚Äôt ALWAYS the most active.

Now I have another cat who is 12 and he‚Äôs a great lap cat. He actually started turning into a lap cat at age 8 or so. He‚Äôs going to be an even better lap cat when he‚Äôs 15-16."
aww,The dog having that blanket is like if my white ass had a blanket of some random black dude
aww,"The thing about puppies and kittens is that they LOVE body heat, so they'll all huddle together on you without any inhibition. Laying down and having 8 puppies jump around and huddle on top of me was truly one of the greatest experiences I've ever had."

aww,"I mean, this is EXACTLY what I ordered."

aww,Certain restaurants or small mom &amp; pop grocery stores will buy them around here.
aww,"Yeah, yeah. Cute and all, but as soon as you two become comfortable around each other, he‚Äôs gonna let himself go: bigtime. He‚Äôll probably gamble away both of your incomes, develop a pain killer habit, and you‚Äôll soon never know whether he‚Äôs coming home or not.  Think about that before you start drooling over pure superficiality!"

aww,This was my first thought as well.
aww,Which edit did ya see? I did a ton.
aww,looks like the puppy needs a blanket
aww,"Yeah, the animals  that frequent Disney world, have lost the fear of humans.

aww,My sheltie gives me this face and I‚Äôm a goner.
aww,If the ass to the nose doesn‚Äôt wake up kitty nothing will
aww,"Please try to figure out if she has been spayed or not. As someone who had to rescue a third litter of kittens, and their feral mother, I see how feral cats can get out of control. 

https://www.wikihow.com/Tell-if-a-Cat-Is-Spayed"
aww,Seems like a pretty weird thing to imagine but okay...
aww,That's exactly what that collar is. Tough guy trying to turn that poor puppy into a tough dog.
aww,I bet a snack and a snuggle was exactly what she needed.
aww,"Her name is Jade and [here's one](https://i.imgur.com/10mIjOw.jpg) where she looks less derpy

I don't want /u/The_Phantom_Fap 's contribution to go un-noticed, so [here's the edit he posted with lasers](http://i.imgur.com/NMC7xgL.jpg)

EDIT: now that this thread is finally dying if you want to see more dumb pictures of this cat, she's on IG @heyjadebutt. Be forewarned that nothing else will be as good as this photo. She has peaked"
aww,Ive def seen my house cat slide and fall over many many times when overexcited
aww,Cheap cat food is for peasants. Peasants!
aww,I‚Äôm signed up to do yoga with kittens tomorrow as part of an adoption drive. Hope I‚Äôm this relaxed afterward!
aww,Ugliest. Dog. Ever.  And I would adopt him in a minute if capable.
aww,"Nope, just the mom of much smaller birbs that would totally fly right into that shit"
aww,Does anyone know...do lions have the same kind of dander that regular cats have?
aww,I love this so hard. The derpy half smile is totally what makes this photo.
aww,"My first daughter born 3 months early and I spent many many hours and days in the NICU (hospital was a 1.5 hour drive). Did it everyday for 2.5 months and worked. She is 18 now and you would never guess her life started a bit rough. 

You sound like a very proud dad, keep being that and the rest will fall into place."
aww,They're both really nice but I like the derpy one best.
aww,Mine does something similar. When he was a tiny kitten he use to sleep on my shoulder. He doesn't fit anymore but he sure tries his hardest. If he doesn't sleep there it's with with a paw on my chest or curled up by my knees.
aww,"I‚Äôm guessing by the lack of two headbands that it‚Äôs a boy/girl twin combination, in which case I‚Äôm pretty sure they could not have twin-to-twin syndrome, as I believe that only occurs in identical twins that share a placenta.

Preemies are known to have stomach issues, so it‚Äôs possible one just took to feedings easier than the other."
aww,are you saying hammit
aww,There actually was a cartoon about a dog version of Superman. Krypton the Superdog if I remember correctly
aww,"If you can't remember usernames of people you've had 5 or 6 post exchanges with only around 12 hours ago, I hate to break it to ya pal, but your memory is not doing very well. You've gotta' be a fast food worker or something with a memory like that. Or you're just spamming the hell out of reddit and not paying attention. Which I'll address in a moment.

What am I doing wrong? ""Not cleaning my counters""? That thing you just made up, that I never said, and explicitly told you that you need to be doing BOTH?


And nice thinly veiled attempt at not looking absolutely pathetic with that even more idiotic attempt to pretend you didn't remember and you weren't specifically checking back in on this thread even though you backed out and deleted your stuff because you realized how dumb you look. You're pathetic, and I don't buy that you didn't remember this conversation for a single second.


*Edit (since you're still clicking refresh by the second):* The way it *actually* works is I, for instance, was curious when I saw you deleted all your comments and tried to remember your name so I could see if you were just trolling and I missed the joke. Then you brilliantly chimed back in. And of course I can identify a name I saw 5 or 6 times about 12 hours ago. This is hilarious."
aww,Oh! This collar actually hurts him?
aww,Dog version of Russel from UP!
aww,Merle danes are the best

aww,He's helping. Get a decoy box?
aww,cats nibbas be like
aww,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd trust something that powerful to hug me.

Be like hugging the rock. Naw dude, go hug a bow flex."

aww,The poor thing has nice spots to sleep and lots of cardboard boxes to chew on like a weirdo.

aww,I believe you‚Äôre right. Good catch. :)

aww,Those old Comcast gateways are the worst.
aww,"Mines got a spot, too!"

aww,"SHUT THE FRONT DOOR

WE HAVE ALPACAS IN SWFL?!?! 

How deep into NFM (because you know damn well Cape Coral isn‚Äôt cool enough to allow them) do I have to go to see alpacas?! This is a mini trip I am willing to take."
aww,"Just a heads up, don't give kitties too much spinach, because it may mess with their urinary tract. A little is ok, just not every day."
aww,Lucky. All my cat wants to do is bite and sniff my ears
aww,such a purrrrrfect photo. im amazed how much of a cat-astrophie this comment section is becoming
aww,Gosh I just love Jane Goodall! What amazing work she and her team has done.
aww,"Oh, God bless little one"
aww,seriously as a vet student i die a little more inside when people just feeding cats a whole ass chicken instead of food
aww,"Omg! Adorable! I love bats. We get them in at work sometimes, but I don't get to handle them."
aww,"""Here's your trophy!""

""thanks!"" *shoves it in gob*"
aww,Mine does this with cantaloupe and honeydew. But she chomps and gets the juice everywhere.
aww,For some reason I‚Äôve always appreciated the guys in the background. Idk what it is but they just evoke some sort of feeling I can‚Äôt describe
aww,"The perfect Sunday morning is a breakfast burrito from Lucky Boy and a trip to the Pasadena Humane Society to play with the pups, kittens, and ~~alligator~~.  

Congrats on adopting such a cutie! I tried to adopt from there for a about a month or two but I kept ending up at least 3rd on wait lists :("
aww,He looks like a horse hamster.
aww,Definitely top 5 ugliest dogs I‚Äôve ever seen. With that said I would still adopt the lil guy in a heartbeat
aww,Holy shit that dog is adorable!
aww,Reminds me of Kylo Ren in TFA
aww,"Adhd sucks indeed. I understand time tho. But the feel of time is inconsistent. So one day 10 seconds feels like 10 minutes, but later 10 minutes feels like 10 seconds. And sometimes 10 seconds feels like 10 seconds, therefor i never know how much time that has actually elapsed. So i use alarms every 5 minutes in the morning so i dont get late to work etc."
aww,"Noted, I‚Äôll cut down on it! Thanks!"
aww,"Mine is guessing what time it is and being within 1 to 2 minutes, not terribly handy."
aww,Tell me you wouldn‚Äôt do the same
aww,"Seriously. I'm a dog/puppy person first and foremost. I like cats a lot too, but something about kittens, man. They make me question my loyalty. Crazy cute."
aww,They like to den and burrow.  It's weird having a dog now that refuses to sleep under covers after having Bostons so long.  I need to get me another one.
aww,PUH-leeeeez tell me the doggo's name is Earnest.  That would be so perfect.
aww,That dog just did more for his spouse than my spouse has done for me in 22 years.
aww,"Okay, I'm crying my eyes out and clutching my baby doggy so hard üò≠üò≠üò≠"
aww,"But like straight up who was like ""let's give a rat a horse's nose and make him the size of a small dog"""
aww,That face will haunt my dreams for eternity.
aww,"I have to male cousins, one 20, the other 19,who both have this terrible disease. They live decent lives other than having this, but man... I would jump on a grenade for their chance to lead their own lives.. I hope this is a start for a cure."
aww,"I mean, if she's actually a stray she's likely hunting things for nutrition, not killing for instinct but leaving them to rot.  A bell in that case would be unfair. There's always a chance OP might not get around to feed her, and it's not like an indoor cat who has a dish full."
aww,"same, i've heard some cringey stuff from clients and this is up there"
aww,"If I tell you what's going to happen, it won't happen.

Hope you enjoy the film when you get to see it!"
aww,"Glad to see I'm not the only one a little scared by his appearance. Would foster him first, probs adopt. Realistically speaking."
aww,"He's not angry in this photo,  just looking sinister. ""Welcome to my restaurant. I'm going to cook this kitten"""
aww,You are my favorite person today. Thank you for saving that kitten. I hope someday soon you get paid millions to feed baby llamas and any other animals you like.

aww,Hey look it‚Äôs a balanced mewl
aww,Why isn't anyone pointing out the fact this contraption just made doggo disappear?? Did he discover time travel? Is he the first to experience teleportation? Who's a good boy?
aww,There are drugs for that.
aww,But decent payment for probably hitting the cat in the cat in the face a thousand times a day with their tails. :)
aww,Looks a lot like a catahoula to me!!
aww,This is one of the better comments on this post.
aww,Dads who dislike cats end up being the most cat loving dads off all.
aww,"I surrender!  I surrender!!!  Just give me that purple ball, and I swear I'll never nip your tail!"
aww,They were talking about the dog...
aww,"Many cats have been known to chew grasses and other greens in small quantities.

It apparently has something to do with maintaining gut health. Also maybe folic acid."
aww,Adorable. Their expressions remind me of the happy/sad theater masks.
aww,Turkish Angola?  Any idea?
aww,"Yep. I bought a little olive tree and came home the thing chewed to bits. Must be the same with grapes. I have to keep grapes, specifically the stems, out of reach. My one dude goes crazy for grapes. He sniffs them out like a bloodhound. Zero interest in other people food."
aww,"Woah. My aunt is always picking morels and she gives her entire family huge freezer bags full of them. No idea where she picks but I thought they were super common, given the quantity she consistently finds."
aww,Stress relief? More like instant allergies.
aww,They seem to be just hanging out.
aww,All this fart talk is weirdly making me miss my childhood BT. He was such a good and smelly boy.
aww,She looks like she just pooped in your shoe and is waiting for you to notice
aww,"Because it's ""cute"" so they can make money off of the breed. Also just the selfishness of humans in general. Most people buying the breed may be really unaware of the health issues that can come up later in life and then friends and family see the breed and also be unaware and buy them making a demand for it."
aww,Are the mice marsupials too?
aww,That hug was given before it was asked for.
aww,Talk about upstaging the bride !
aww,You should keep her outside but get a collar so she's not taken to a shelter
aww,"don‚Äôt know how old u are, but i came here to comment this! when i was at my parents house, i had to keep my cat in my room, no matter what. it broke my heart. she probably spent 3-4 years in there. 

when i moved out, at first she was anxious over al the space, and the ceiling fan. but 5 years later, she‚Äôs such a sweet and chill cat. she hangs out outside, loves guests, and doesn‚Äôt get nervous. i love my cat so much, she has made my life infinitely better!"
aww,Your Chinese is a little raw

aww,"Lmao, that expression drives it home!"
aww,I know!! Such love for papa bear.
aww,I had the very fortunate pleasure of meeting her as a child! Jane Goodall does an amazing chimp impression!
aww,"i think people always forget that animals... naturally live outside lol. she may be a little dirty, but i really don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs suffering! cats love hunting bugs and birds. don‚Äôt feel too bad"

aww,Holy cow i'm totally going so fast OWFUCK!

aww,"It is so true, I love Ducks!"
aww,I saw a japanese game show were you are locked in a room with no way to tell time and have to come out as close to 24 hours later as possible. You could win!

aww,Capybara - not giving a fuck since forever.
aww,"That prong collar is WAY too low on the dogs neck. Looks like there are spikes on the trachea too. Get a Herm Sprenger.

Edit: also, prong collars are a training tool. They absolutely should not be worn constantly."

aww,"It's like a Dug / Russell cosplay, ""I have just met you and I love you."""
aww,I love this guy√†
aww,I think you have to turn it on first /s
aww,"Sounds a little like my cat. She's not a cuddler either, shes sleeps at the end of my bed sometimes.

But when I wake up she gets the sweetest look on her face and walks up next me and sits next to me for about 20 minutes and I pet her. And then she done. All cuddles gone until the next she sleeps at the foot of bed."
aww,We have a rescue that looks just like that and we‚Äôve been told he resembles a silky terrier. Yours is adorable :)
aww,Take him home with you for his golden years!!

aww,Love to see that cats of all sizes do the flop and slide when suddenly trying to change directions while running.

Maybe get him a weighted blanket for dogs."
aww,"I did, only shows her paws still"
aww,"Yeah pretty much. I had an outdoor cat who lived to be almost 20. We did have a little crate for her whenever she needed to go to the vet but for the most part she was extremely low maintenance. Hardly needed any attention and would often chill on the roof for hours on end.

Never really realized how great of a cat she was until I was older after she died. She lived a great independent life."

aww,"I usually buy organic ones I think‚Ä¶ Honestly, I just buy whichever ones look better.

Edit: I just tried it. Cat was not interested. I didn‚Äôt bother trying it with the one who doesn‚Äôt like fish."

aww,It‚Äôs all fun and games until one of them pees on you.
aww,We think she is a Jack Russel Terrier mixed with a larger breed.
aww,"I have one that‚Äôs similar. He likes to cuddle on his terms and I‚Äôm the only one in the house that can touch him. When I set my phone down and take my glasses off for the night, he comes over and lays down along my arm with his head in my hand. He just lays there and gets ear scratches and pets until he‚Äôs done with me. Sometimes, he brings a foam soccer ball and wants to play fetch.  I look forward to our nightly bedtime cuddles."
aww,When you think you are a lap cat but you obviously no longer are.
aww,"It was interesting to see that she was the only one who did not initiate contact with the chimp. She just stood quietly, and eventually she got the biggest hug."
aww,You see this face? This is a face of happiness.
aww,That thing needs a glove or something. Feel like the pets would be a bit rough.
aww,This made me smile lol. Happy cake day!

aww,They sent you somthing better
aww,"While it's not out of the realm of possibility, one baby was probably just bigger than the other. 

My son was 2 lbs heavier than his twin sister at birth and they did not share a placenta."
aww,Wife and I are cat people so we gave up on getting nice furniture. We ask what is durable to pets

aww,it has long been my dream to own a truffle farm with truffle-hunting dogs
aww,Crazy! How many did you manage to harvest?

aww,"Just today, my cat escaped through the side of the air conditioner and snuck back in with (what I thought was) a chipmunk. His tooth must‚Äôve went in the poor things eyeball because it was red and bulging on just one side. I put the cats up and opened the window and it flew about 8 feet out, so I‚Äôm not sure what it was. Nailing the side of the ac closed soon.  Poor thing."

aww,Yes!  And the camera
aww,"Whoa those pictures are actually super cool. I adopted an Aussie/catahoula/border collie mix with a pink nose, and I stumbled upon a page earlier that showed the pink can disappear and be replaced with pigment over time, but it wasn't all that conclusive. You have unintentionally gotten me really excited -- I'm not a fan of her nose honestly, and I know it can sunburn really bad too. Here's hoping she gets a solid chocolate nose eventually."

aww,Congrats!! They are sweet as can be!
aww,"is ""step"" now inappropriate to use?  I can't keep up with the list of newly offensive terms.  It wouldn't shock me since step derives from Old English steop, which meant ""orphan""."

aww,"Is it the kind of thing where only mushroom aficionados can truly appreciate them, or does anyone who tries them think they are amazing?

Similar to me appreciating a truly good cup of coffee, whereas my mother, who thinks Folgers from her Mr. Coffee is fine, doesn‚Äôt know what the fuss is all about when I get her a cup of a brew I prefer?

Edit: spelling"

aww,I can‚Äôt handle this. Ooo my god
aww,*Buys pet hamster just for this*
aww,"This was me when my cats had kitties. My all gray boy (pachi) who we think is a royal blue, and then just a regular tabby girl, had the cutest little fuckers man. At 3-4 weeks like one guy mentioned is the cutest. Thats when they start getting real plump and moving around haha. Their little hops when they want to jump, hiding in shoes to sleep, ahh so cute. A couple of them were white/tan ish color and they were adorable. Blue eyes too. Fat little son bitch. Only one came out the brown/tan color like mom and she was just a peanut (moms small too).

you never heard of a mountain lion or bobcat?"
aww,"Me, that guy looked hot"
aww,"""I such goodest boi that even trees have changed forms to do the pettins, I so hap"""
aww,"actually deer are pretty intelligent lol. they‚Äôre able to recognize patterns in time, they can interpret human behavior, and they learn from experience. this is just an animal exhibiting its own reaction to happiness. many animals react in this sort of manner, like cows and even bunnies (when bunnies are really happy they ‚Äúbinky‚Äù it‚Äôs super cute) and way more animals. even humans react in similar ways (jumping up and down in excitement, etc)

edit: as u/KIFPfivemilesout pointed out in [their comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/bjxkoh/ive_never_thought_of_deer_as_playful/emd6kxw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x): more examples of animals exhibiting this type of behavior are goats, sheep, dogs, cats, horses, and possibly even breaching whales !! :-)"
aww,I hope he doesn‚Äôt relapse and start drinking again.

aww,I would do the same if I had chickens and I could knit.
aww,Top right kitty also looks like she‚Äôs about to impart some crucial old school philosophical wisdom on our protagonist
aww,Or they just started petting other cats and just are too in love. My preferred interpretation
aww,"We used to have fun names for me when the kids were growing up. Step-Brad or they would refer to us in photos @DadandBrad but since they were 15 and 17 they just started introducing us as ""my dads"". I tried so hard to hold my composer the first time they called me their Dad. I was playing it cool shaking hands saying hi to people, but in my head I was a cross between Super Saiyan achievement unlocked and a sobbing bitch. It's a big deal."
aww,I want that dog.
aww,"Raccoons, possums, and skunks. Ohio is awful."

aww,Suki cat is the BEST!!! I'm obsessed with her!
aww,I've seen parents who end up giving twin A a name starting with A and B a name starting with B. I've also heard nurses start referring to twins as Aiden and Brayden when their parents were taking too long to pick names for them.

aww,This made my heart melt ughhh
aww,The real maze is the friends we made along the way.

aww,Thought that was a small cougar or bobcat for a second.
aww,This is why they do a round of unpoisoned bait before they drop the poisoned stuff. The rats and possums ect. will then eat the otherwise identical poisoned bait thinking it's safe.
aww,"Single strobe, through a large diffused beauty dish. To camera right, and slightly behind the kitty

aww,Ohh I love that!! So suiting for a German shepherd :)
aww,I‚Äôm sorry about the medical bill.
aww,"&gt; they did the same thing for beavers. and that isn't a staple of anyones diet

I would imagine beaver meat would have been a ready source of protein in the eighteenth century or so for natives and subsequent colonists. Matter of fact, five minutes on Google with the search ""did natives eat beaver"" outright proves you wrong."

Hi Sully!"
aww,Yeah! I remember this from the early 2000s!
aww,The tub looks so small.
aww,You cant be for real

aww,"That's totally r/aww, but... That's a dog. Not an olive."
aww,"Of course, but you can wipe for hours and not get all of it. The only actually hygienic thing to do is use a bidet or shower. Bidets aren't common in the US and given that I tend to poop 2-3 times a day generally, showering each time isn't realistic. I assume it's the same for most people, so chances are if you've eaten ass multiple times you've definitely consumed a nonsignificant amount of human shit."
aww,"Were you thinking of the woman who studied gorillas? I always think they‚Äôre one in the same. When I read your comment, it actually made me double check because I thought she was murdered, but it was Fossey, the one who Gorillas in the Mist was about."

aww,"Wow, my cat does the same! I thought we were special but you took it away from me!!"
aww,"Most strays have never had an owner, many strays are the result of old farm and small town cats that helped to keep rodents and birds away from farm crops and to prevent infestations. Can't do that locked in a house all day."

But then again I'm not a released animal. I thnk"

aww,I‚Äôve heard they really hate having the bell on because it alerts animals to their whereabouts so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a cat learned how to get it off. I would always take the bell of off my cats. Seems to make the collar last a little longer

aww,"My apartment complex uses part of our pet rent to fund this little cat sanctuary they have at the edge of the property. There‚Äôs a patch of trees between us and the retirement home next door and they‚Äôve built a bunch of these boxes, lay down straw to cover the mud, put out food, etc. They also catch and have the strays spayed or neutered. It‚Äôs pretty awesome honestly. 

They also allow large dogs, and have all kinds of pet amenities. The owners must be animal lovers."
aww,Beavers are also found in europe and were considered fish for the purposes of fasting days long before the Americas were discovered. besides just because people ate them doesn't make them a staple or essential part of a diet.

aww,I can‚Äôt watch this again.  Too dehydrated.
aww,"Found it, thanks and congrats ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

aww,You're a good friend.
aww,Brave whoever took that picture

They're adorable, though. Congrats, OP!"
aww,Thank you for this!
aww,10/10 goofy pupper but also the capo left on the fretboard of the guitar is driving me nuts
aww,They do have great customer service. We ordered the wrong thing once and they sent me another for free and asked me to donate the other.  It was a good dish.  So we did. Been using them for a few years.

aww,"I'm not super invested in Marvel as a franchise, and I hadn't seen IW and had no plans to see Endgame, and then I happened to see the spoilers for Endgame online; it made me curious enough that I ended up streaming IW on netflix that night, and then seeing Endgame the next day. Without the spoilers to pique my interest it probably would have been a couple years before I went to see it. While I'm not completely on board with everything in the movie, I'm glad I ended up going to see it, it was worth it."
aww,"I have that weird mix of being adhd but also a musician so I have a weird built on timer that randomly malfunctions. So like if I'm microwaving food, you better believe if I walk away and come back I can get back just in time for the perfect ""3...2...1... Done"". But God forbid if I'm trying to do more daily tasks like work or cleaning, any amount of time from about 10 seconds to 6 hours could pass and I could barely tell the difference."

One of the many reasons I don't let my cat go outside."
aww,"He‚Äôs just a sk8r boi, she said see ya later boi"

aww,"You are so in trouble üòä.  Good luck sleeping for the next 20 years.  


Btw.  NICUs are a great thing to graduate from.  My oldest spend a couple of weeks there before coming home.  He now has a masters degree from one of the highest ranked schools in the country.  Something about drive.  Drive to survive at first and then drive to succeed.  May your children continue to have that drive."
aww,Yes and I'm not sure which face she had when she shit under my bed the other day
aww,Chihuahua and husky? Maybe chihuahua 1/2 husky 1/4 golden 1/4
aww,"She looks cgi, jesus."
aww,Sad that your patenta dont let you give her a home. But at least you be near her
aww,"Just be sneaky, give her a bath, keep her in your room. She looks chill and sleepy"
aww,"I do agree with the bird killing part, stray and feral cats are terrible for the bird population and are causing a catastrophe. However for the piss and shit part, what do you expect them to do? They are animals just like us."
aww,Awwww he wants to share your slipper
aww,"Hahahahahaha, I'll tell my 74 year old mother - who looks after Charlie - that you said that."
aww,I can tell what size socket or wrench I'm going to need for a bolt by looking at it from up to 15 feet away.
aww,"So, just your average meeting with HR."
aww,"When we got our beagle from an Ohio (Lick County) rescue way back about 15 yrs ago, she had torn up ears...and could not stand to be touched. Eventually she would hop on and and off my lap, but if she lay down there, I couldn‚Äôt even pet her or she‚Äôd just run off. So I just let her lay there. Heartbreaking. But she came around eventually. We called her The Bitch. Haha I loved her. She‚Äôs gone now and we need up w a greyhound . Sight instead of scent."
aww,lol Universidade de S√£o Paulo (USP) in Brazil. But I'm sure that places at the north of the country is probably even more common.
aww,Very true. If I ever got a cat again I think I‚Äôd just keep it inside. Nothing worse then getting attached and someone decides they want it.
aww,"Stop stating the obvious, haha jk"
aww,That's amazing lol. Adorable kitty too of course!
aww,"Because they are far more prolific breeders, harder to catch (*much, much* harder), less likely to trust people, far sneakier, and frankly very difficult to catch anyway.  Feral cats usually don‚Äôt interact with humans unless they have something to gain from the interaction, and if they don‚Äôt think you have anything worthwhile, odds are good they are going to keep their distance and you may not even know they are there.

Simply put, most people don‚Äôt really notice until they are everywhere.  Dogs bark, cats don‚Äôt.  Dogs are bigger.  Dogs are man‚Äôs best friend and are more common pets.  Street cats are more skittish and likely to run away or hide.

That, and free pest control."
aww,"Lol yea people just shouldn't let their cats out. They think they're wild enough, they're not"
aww,"

Parole Board member: 'Cause we just want to hear the truth.

H.I.: Well, then I guess I am telling you what you want to hear.

Parole Board chairman: Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that?

H.I.: Yes, sir.

Parole Board chairman: Okay, then."
