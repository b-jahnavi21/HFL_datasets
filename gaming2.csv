gaming,"Honestly the games industry kinda sucks in a lot of areas, as you have probably heard most fields around them tend to have very low job security with massive amounts of overtime expected during certain periods of the job.  Unless you want to absolutely murder your interests in games, you may be best off trying to do some part-time stuff on the side.  There ins't really a job where you actually get to ""play"", even if you are Q/A testing it's pretty rigorous and you are just playing one game for 6 months on end, checking literally everyhting.

You could try to get into streaming if you feel like you might have the ability to be entertaining enough.  Granted, making a good living as a streamer isn't an easy task, it's a lot of luck to get yourself noticed out of the thousands of others.  But it's something you could do on the side while working a normal job, and who knows if things take off it could be a full time thing.  Theres still a lot of work with it as well, but it's the only job where you can actively just have fun playing games at your own pace doing what you want.  At the very least, might be a side activity you would have fun doing that you can get paid for.

Games journalism could be a good one too, if you are a decent writer.  You also get to simply play said games.  Of course you're in a bit more of a rush since you need to get reviews out ASAP but you can still play a bunch of games, just not necessarily at your own pace."
gaming,Yeah which is would company X could help people stop buying them. Forcing other companies to stop them too.
gaming,ahh cool zombies is fun but i rather do man vs machine on TF2
gaming,My heart only has a place for Sargnarg the Hardgeharg.
gaming,"This is like posting which is better? MW2 or Halo reach!

You’re about 7 years too late for the repost man."
gaming,For an imgur link? Scumbags. It's even marked it nsfw as well!
gaming,The Tails Movie: A Long Road to Rehab
gaming,Awesome game!   Might have to blow the dust off &amp; give it another play thru.
gaming,Am i dumb? Why is Ike carrying visene?
gaming,The new war is EA vs Epic in 2019 for most hated video game company nowadays.
gaming,But did they earn their nicknames the same way?
gaming,"It won't affect your files or documents. It might uninstall any programs you added since the restore point.

Choose whichever drive your Windows installation is on, usually C"
gaming,**OP speaks the truth**
gaming,"Thank you! The story is quite minimal with a larger focus on exploring the world and puzzle solving. Appreciate the kind comments, I hope you enjoy it if you decide to check it out!"
gaming,I'm not sure? Opens fine for me and it's only an imgur link.
gaming,Download the game and link the key to your battlenet account.
gaming,he still looks closer in age to the younger brother.
gaming,Fighter of the Nightman?
gaming,"The real question is, are we getting Ugandan knuckles?"
gaming,Yeah thats what i continue to hear I enjoy Man vs Machine in TF2 to zombies tho
gaming,And somehow this is worse.
gaming,"I got both an Xbox one and a ps4 but never actually played them. 

The 360 is always going to be my favorite console after the gamecube lol."
gaming,Looks like film sonic
gaming,"If you gift the game to me, I’ll play with you."
gaming,Those lines were crossed long ago.
gaming,You can still get it on steam 6 months later nothing stopping you
gaming,To be fair there is still an enormous amount of hate.
gaming,"You don’t need a bag, no one wants a ps4"
gaming,"The Sonic racers game was pretty good tho, also maybe Sonic just wanted to be a radical dude."
gaming,"Nice try *Sonic The Hedgehog Movie* PR team...

You're clearly a plant in the industry who posted this picture in order to stir the controversy over the new look in the movie."
gaming,I love it! Cool style. Hope to see more of your art.
gaming,It all makes sense now..
gaming,that guy is also a woman.
gaming,Cuz I called a random redditor fat for complaining about an ass pic? Right on.
gaming,Nah... it's less a console war as a war of exclusives.
gaming,"Yeah, understandable but I’ve never liked tf2."
gaming,"Sadly, I can't do it as I'm still trying to find out which corner I should cut to save. My costly lunch due to light breakfast or my required amount of caffeinated drinks to keep me up in my classes. 4hrs classes in the afternoon is good and all but it can be costly if your running on fumes due to how bad you deal with mornings."
gaming,I just destroy them before there are too many
gaming,Sonic the rodent must do speed
gaming,that's probably because the mocap is a grown man that's shrunken down. the proportions on the right look way better but it wouldnt have fit a man and they'd have to go in and redo all of it or something. i guess they were too lazy. the left literally looks like a man in a furry suit. even the head is too big because the head goes over a real person's head.
gaming,"Me: ""I dont have time for this""
Bandit: ""Dont turn your back on me!""
Bandit dies in one blow..."
gaming,as long as you're not playing on asian servers you're not too bad off
gaming,"What specifically about Sims grabs your attention so much? Maybe if we can pick out some details we can use them to suggest other games.

I would suggest playing Rim World. It's visually a lot more simple looking, but there's quite a lot of detail on things you can do. You control survivors who crash land on a planet, you can mine into mountains to create a home, you'll get attacked by bandits, can capture the bandits and recruit them to be part of your team. Each person in your team has a different personality trait which will lead to different situations/events you'll come across.

The game is less focused on personally customizations (like sims) and more leaning towards management.

But yeah, if you want to try out other games maybe branch out towards management type games, where you take care of things. Rimworld, Stardew Valley, My Time At Portia, all good games."
gaming,"Lmfao, what a joke."
gaming,"It’s the trading card game model, same game new cards every year. 

Still fun though."
gaming,"Looking at this deeper, Andre looks like Owl from sekiro. Sekiro = dark souls confirmed lore. Andre is Sekiro's daddy."
gaming,Thanks so much! :D
gaming,You must have never played Settlers of Catan.
gaming,"I can take a pic for ya if ya want, but I’m on Xbox so that’s probably why. PS4 gets the whole update before Xbox, but they both get part of it at the same time I’m pretty sure so that’s why I can still play I assume."
gaming,To repent you need to do 10 hail battlefields.
gaming,Still looks better than the movie
gaming,And yet somehow it's worse
gaming,Does NBA 2k also fit in here?
gaming,I never got that bit either.
gaming,"I prefer not to get carpel tunnel, tyvm. 
Jk, I play both, because carpel tunnel isn’t that bad."
gaming,"I kinda hate you, you’ve given me hope!

But alright, this looks fun and you’ve laid out some good reasons. I think I gotta look into this Scythe game. I’ve got Warhammer buddies that I could (hopefully!) convince to try it!"
gaming,I'm out of the loop on the two rows of molars
gaming,It’s hilarious because you got downvoted for saying that. Which just proves your point.
gaming,I thought that combo was banned.
gaming,Oh yeah over reacting is here. Theoretical ur right but as long games like star citizen can generate money from nothing iam fine and don't panic.
gaming,It's the only victory we've had in years.
gaming,"What, no Epic exclusive deal?"
gaming,How to get mugged over nothing
gaming,I can't unsee this now
gaming,Change link/ use a diff host
gaming,I just want them to fix physx to be playable with it without destroying my frame rate.
gaming,"No more than the standard cleanup on any mocap data. The actual translation of real person bones to animated character bones is more or less automatic. We once did a job translating a guy doing martial arts onto a t-rex model, stubby little arms and tail included, and once the animation data was imported it was basically just intern work to fix the ugly bits."
gaming,"Honestly no, iirc they hardware ban the cheaters so they can't make new accounts. I play regularly and it's still fun, I just noticed that there is a rise in toxic randos over the past couple weeks which is way more of a problem than cheaters."
gaming,I'm holding back tears after seeing that monstrosity!
gaming,its pretty great actually.  less rupee and heart drops
gaming,DotA or don’t talk to me
gaming,"They took a character that didn’t say a single word and let you - the player - craft their mythos for them. 



Fighting Red blind is one thing, but to battle him after having played the original games drastically elevates his threatening presence. You’ve battled trainers, team Rocket and the Elite Four. Yet, to stand before Red is to face the man that did it all first. The only trainer that could possibly hope to match you in skill, wit and the sheer tenacity to win. You don’t fear him because of his Pokémon. You fear him because he’s the one trainer in the world with the hopes of outclassing you. You fear him because he’s you."
gaming,A Sonic movie is doomed from the start. Remember the Super Mario Bros movie? Platform games do not translate well into movies.
gaming,I love you both
gaming,I have a bunch of Xbox 360 games that are backwards compatible so that’s a big reason I like my xbone.
gaming,144hz and 200+ fps? you must love tearing...
gaming,"Because after the movie trailer, anything goes when it comes to sonic."
gaming,I want to play it in VR but I can't afford VR rn.
gaming,"You're partly right, but consider this; When you have a terminal disease or illness that's going to eventually kill you, you say that you're *dying*. You say that the disease is *killing* you. Is it outright killing you at the moment? No, but it's participating in killing you. It makes you weaker. HIV and AIDS is a good example because it totally kills your immune system, but it's the flu you catch that actually kills you. When people talk about your death, do you think they're going to exclude the fact that you had AIDS? No, they're going to include the entire picture. They're going to say you had AIDS and then you caught the flu.

This instance is no different. The spider finished him off, but the zombie contributed way more than the spider did to his death."
gaming,the left does look exactly like a guy in a fur suit. even the head is too big because it goes over a person's head.
gaming,Warframes free also! Totally free only thing you need premium currency for is cosmetics. It can be a little daunting at first but the player base is pretty helpful so just ask of you don't know how to do something or if something doesn't work. See you on the rails tenno
gaming,"This joke is so old and dead, nobody likes fanboys like you OP."
gaming,Remind me of Kingsman for some reason... 🤓
gaming,My childhood is ruined
gaming,really man i loved the TF series so much only reason i bought HalfLife was for CS and TF mods
gaming,Brainwashed much.  Tell your friends in the Video game industry to back off
gaming,"Now the movie one just needs to shave??? his arms, wear huge gloves abs shoes and we're getting closer"
gaming,Maybe if you can't figure out how texture packs work you belong in the soulstone anyway
gaming,Probably. Ryan Reynolds has been dropping mini-trailers on his YouTube channel every few days.
gaming,"It's still asking for something to go wrong. Baby zombies are too fast, knock back in a cave might have it hit a wall and stay too close.

I think the biggest mistake was wearing the elytra while caving, proper chest piece with good prot enchants would have given him the time to think and eat the apple then clean up the mobs."
gaming,"If you meant money - 

Per console...

PC: $100 a year
Switch: $720 a year at least
PS4: $180 a year
Xbox One: LMAO $0 (Use it as 4K player)

This doesn't include birthday or Christmas gifts.

If you meant time -

Roughly 3-4 hours a day. Weekends can be marathons at upwards to 8-16 hours a day."
gaming,This movie would have to be CARREYed by something for it to do good
gaming,See the [worst image](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/apr/30/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-trailer) of this debacle of a movie yet.
gaming,For sure but not nearly what it was 50 years ago
gaming,We're not speaking the legal system here.
gaming,How DARE he spend his money the way he wants. /s
gaming,Yeah it's actually a really good business decision I think. It's hard to have a game store nowadays
gaming,Works fine for me
gaming,"No, Sony isn't gonna be at e3."
gaming,Works fine for me
gaming,You know what's funny about this? They probably did a focus group on the character and it passed. Now the fans are mad and they don't have a clue what to do about it.
gaming,Too late for that
gaming,"Dying Light or Stat of Decay 2 both zombie games, and both really fun."
gaming,"Aka, you put it into a machine and it did all the neat stuff :P nice... work?"
gaming,"No, Sony isn't going to be at E3 this year."
gaming,God I love dishonored
gaming,"I doubt it won't have micros. Just look at BL2 -  https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/49520/Borderlands_2/

Still getting it.  Could care less about micros and Epic.  Just my thoughts."
gaming,"Also personally I love these morphsuits they're actually very high quality. Most of that shading is in the suit and not her body lmao 

Also look up instagram vs reality youll get a better understanding what I mean

Edit: Listen downvote me all you want and hope she looks like that irl to a ""T"". Just look closer at photo backgrounds and how people (not specifically one gender or minority either) edit their phitos. Sudden curved tiles. Parts of photos slipping down or up. Straight doorways tilting and even a subtle indent in the background near curves.

Edit2: stop dming me about this just because someone is how doesnt mean they are perfect, calm down you horndogs"
gaming,Another company won’t be able to capture enough market share without micro transactions. Investors won’t give them money because they will have substantially less return on capital. And with less money it won’t be marketed enough to put it in consumers minds. There are hardly ever games made by indie publishers that crack the top 10 games sold in a year
gaming,"That’s really cool, I can’t even imagine what it’s like to have skill"
gaming,And they also fix his legs-to-torso ratio while they’re at it
gaming,No. There was a big tipping point. Can't tell you exactly when but we're over the worst of it I hope.
gaming,I wonder what their design for a Pac-man movie would look like?
gaming,That’s actually what it might be lol
gaming,The ability to select special ammo and grenades.
gaming,I would be fine with this
gaming,"Cool, I like how you too the existing joke and retold it."
gaming,Yeah man I think the way ludicolo looks is great
gaming,"Dude I reallly REALLY hope to god this image speaks the truth. I mean I look at the trailer and it’s so cringe and horrible to look at but then I imagine that he’s gonna get white shades or something, some gloves and shoes and he’s gonna magically look cool instead of nightmare inducing to my future children..."
gaming,"I spend an average of 10 Euros per month.
In general I play my games through and so I am quite busy.
How much did I spend already?
Around 500 Euros I would say.
Gifts excluded."
gaming,I cant even make a fucking boat hat with paper...
gaming,Oh wow thanks for this meme that everybody’s seen everyday for the past week
gaming,I played fortnite for a few minutes when it came out so That if it counts
gaming,And strangely muscular calves...
gaming,Is their any survival aspects in the game?
gaming,"Kinda wondering how they're supposed to change it.

Give all players knives and add a soccer royale mode?"
gaming,Dont thet do their own event for console reveals?
gaming,"I call the *entire year leading up to the event* hype.  I call that post a desperate attempt 2 weeks before the conference (after tickets have already been sold) to stem expectations of Diablo 4 announcements.  That post in directly talking about the Diablo 4 rumors that popped up over the course of the year, which is what ""We know what many of you are hoping for and we can only say that “good things come to those who wait,” but evil things often take longer. "" is referring to.

Even that post still mentions some upcoming Diablo news, and Blizzard still had Diablo lined up for the main stage (and even long before that post, it was known there was going to be a Diablo announcement main stage.)  Blizzard was presenting that Diablo announcement as their centerpiece of Blizzcon.  That post confirmed said announcement would not be D4, sure, but Blizzard was still setting expectations with having that Diablo related news be the main attraction Blizzcon.  Again, dropping a Mobile game as the biggest news at Blizzcon was a huge marketing failure."
gaming,I'd give it several months or up to a year. Possibly longer.
gaming,"This post right here, officer."
gaming,What? M8 I don't get ur point and I gave a good example why ur wrong so pls don't call me brainwashed
gaming,Is that Zootopia crossover?
gaming,"I broke the cycle this year, moved to PES"
gaming,"To be fare NFL, NBA and NHL are the same."
gaming,That PSP camera tho
gaming,It's also easier to segment the hands if they're on gloves. See: shoulder pads.
gaming,Get that shit outta here.
gaming,"no the mocap is all wrong for the version on the right. meanwhile the mocap on the left exactly fits a man's body. i suspect it was laziness that made them go that route. like on the right, his torso is so short, someone would have to manually shift his arms up every frame but also have to make all the shifts look natural."
gaming,"And he gets some new kicks. 

Fuck it let’s start over....."
gaming,How could you leave out Tarkus??? He's the baddest of them all!! I used to just watch as he'd solo the iron golem.
gaming,It's the twist for the new Sonic movie
gaming,Watch the newest Sonic Trailer that dropped yesterday.
gaming,"What you can 100 everything in Skyrim???
Always thought it was limited to certain points"
gaming,Accurate representation of new live action Sonic film
gaming,Not this shit again...
gaming,Absolutely not me irl.  I save twice just to be sure I saved.
gaming,Seen sekiro for $45 so far
gaming,ATV offroad fury 1&amp;2!
gaming,&gt;Is it possible to unsee a movie trailer?
gaming,"This is an excellent example of why the fire enchantment on swords should be made a curse, removed, or buffed in some way. It does more harm to the player than good. Make Sword fire unable to be spread back to the player."
gaming,"Idk man, I bought GoW on sale a couple of months after it came out"
gaming,I could've lived my life without seeing this
gaming,I can’t take “Pro Gamers” seriously.  Basically hype  beasts of the Internet.
gaming,Which EA has monopolized basically since they forced out the competition with exclusivity deals with the various sports associations
gaming,"Your submission has been removed because we do not allow redd.it link posts except for static images. Why? Our spam controls get screwed up by the v.redd.it domain.  Please use Youtube to host videos or imgur/gfycat for gifs, thanks!

gaming,No you meant boys hole
gaming,"Don't know why, but the bottom one make me think of Mr Krabs....."
gaming,It says that no restore points have been created. Can I create a restore point now and put an old date? Example: 28/4/2019
gaming,That’s a definitive no from me dawg
gaming,"I don't know that realistic hair is kinda disturbing to me lol, maybe if they used the Sonic hair texture it would look better? I don't know I think Ludicolo and Aipom creep me out from this movie lol"
gaming,"With Jonah Hill on the right, I’m starting to believe this is actually a scene from 23 Jump Street."
gaming,"The XBox1 is fine, right?"
gaming,That's so accurate it's sad.
gaming,"I saw most of the steam. I mute the sections where they have people ""talk"". It's stupid scripted jargon and makes it sound like it's some super tactical shooter. Even in tactical competitive shooters, people don't talk like that really. The callouts are really cringe. It's just a part of the ""reveal"" nowadays."
gaming,This is the movie sonic in a nutshell
gaming,Too late. You can't unsee the spectacle.
gaming,"Fun story : as a kid I loved absolutely anything that involved construction. Games, toys, especially driving past job sites. 

I went to college for athletic training and hated it and as I was looking for a new major I came across construction management and instantly knew that’s what I wanted to do. I graduated in 2016 with a degree in construction management. 

Childhood me would be thrilled to know that I’ve worked on industrial and commercial construction projects. I love what I do and am proud to say that my profession was a childhood dream"
gaming,It’s actually a chain called hotdog on a stick
gaming,"You don't get it do you.  Ever since the corporations got more power than the government, they've been leaking into every industry monetizing us."
gaming,That’s a weird way to spell Cartoon Network Racing
gaming,"Oh good, you’re finally awake"
gaming,How do I downvote twice
gaming,see thats why xbox one is better no body will take it from you because they already have one because everyone has a xbox and if you dont have a xbox you very big gai
gaming,I would rather get an xbox one than stabbed but I'd rather have a PS4 than an xbox one
gaming,That's great to hear tho! Love games that can continue to be played and never get old. Best be that good if it's $100+ for the set haha
gaming,This is fake. There is a tear in the back of the package where they took out the original toy. Looks like they sculpted a clay figurine to replace it.
gaming,"Excuse me sir but what in the shit-cocking fuck is my cousin Daryl doing with a spatula. He's not supposed to be handling food, let alone be outside of his room."
gaming,"Here's an example of a photo posted [by a photographer](https://prettyuglylittleliar.net/uploads/monthly_2019_03/21106550_275411389610141_2504035018425130361_n.jpg.10fe434e79d07b2bd561358c45f58777.jpg).

Followed by one posted [by her](https://prettyuglylittleliar.net/uploads/monthly_2019_03/21192880_1092602270869744_4197146453608775034_n.jpg.64beb06f5c5942906f4239a0d45039a2.jpg).

You can see how she regularly trims her waist. I'm not saying she's not real, but passing herself off as someone with impossible proportions. The worst thing is that she's dishonest about things. Says she doesn't use photoshop, waist training, or anything. Just says ""Oh I lost some weight"" which is incredibly dangerous for some people who might start trying to mimic this unnatural body shape through dangerous and unhealthy habits that could lead to eating disorders or body dysmorphia.

[Here is a good summation with some examples](https://prettyuglylittleliar.net/topic/12434-fegalvaofe-galv%C3%A3ofer-cosplay/?page=1)"
gaming,Type the code into battle.net. if you dont have the code then the game wont work.
gaming,I think thi was the right thing to do cause if they played like normal people it would have been a bit cringy sounding
gaming,...is that from that Dane Cook movie where he works at a Costco?
gaming,"My husband gets a bit too angry at competitive games sometimes. Like you, he use to not get so angry but something changed. It’s got so bad that we decided we weren’t going to play league or anything competitive together anymore because he couldn’t control his anger during rough matches and has said some pretty terrible things to me. It was honestly hurting, not only our love relationship, but our friendship as a whole. 

He’s been going to management therapy and has certain steps he takes whenever he starts to get mad for no reason. He still has his moments but far less intense that they use to be. Maybe you too could benefit from finding some coping tools to calm you down during. So you don’t say or do something you’ll regret later. It’s not healthy to treat your friends or yourself this way over something that, in the long run, won’t matter. If league is really the issue, then maybe it’s time to hang up the towel? Stress isn’t good for the heart, my guy. 

As of present, we play only  co-op shooter games together. We couldn’t be happier in our combined gaming experience and both can’t wait for BL3 and the Master Chief collection."
gaming,Still better than movie design
gaming,both are equally shit so it doesnt matter
gaming,"Nothing could be said about it, and yet, I think it looks great, not cute, but great"
gaming,Ah yeah get ur foil head out now and even though ur plan isn't working u must be the head of the company and not the developer
gaming,Games need to commit fully to the open world or not at all. This is why skyrim and fallout work so well: the games literally revolve around exploration and they do everything to make that as fun and rewarding as possible. Just having an open world isn't enough if its bland and uninteresting.
gaming,God damn... Anyone else feel like getting lost on an alien planet rn.
gaming,"Thats wht i ended up doing, hopefully they release just raw gameplay with no commentary.

Imagine what mr torgue would think"
gaming,"The only two arcades near me that are worth a crap are both bar-cades. Apparently kids don't really like arcade machines anymore, but you can get 20 and 30 somethings to pay $8 a beer to play Rampage."
gaming,"I have an Xbox one simply because I really really like halo.  I like forza horizon too, but I’ve never played gran turismo so I can’t comment on which one is the better racing exclusive."
gaming,Looks like Amazon and best buy. It's a little lower at Best buy if you have the gamers club
gaming,"That first npc that bumps your car. Rage, rage, rage."
gaming,Looks like Amazon and best buy. It's a little lower at Best buy if you have the gamers club
gaming,You should see my first attempt.
gaming,"Newsflash, most men and some women, like looking at super attractive women."
gaming,Not as bad as this
gaming,I was just trying to figure out what word you meant yeah.
gaming,I think you'll be able to store the entire snes library a few times over with 64 GB
gaming,"And Madden...

And NCAA football.... RIP"
gaming,"Yeah but it’s still annoying as fuck, you are unable to avoid their attacks (no really it’s impossible) and because they used to be ground it screws me up"
gaming,"This is just like Wolfenstein the new order, the nazis won the war and it's up to bj blascowitz to slowly dismantle the reich."
gaming,"Nope, its more of an ambient exploration/puzzler."
gaming,C U R S E D
gaming,It is required that I increase my forward momentum.
gaming,"Ronda got her face kicked in, if they really cared about female fighters they would of put Cris Cyborg or Amanda Nunes.

Nunes kicked the shit out of Ronda in less than 60secd"
gaming,"Seeing old arcades like arkanoid, pacman, galaga still up and running"
gaming,Blesssed Rao tell me this is fake.
gaming,I'd enjoy a slice of life jrpg. Sort of like persona but without the fighting.
gaming,"i just watched the trailer. i think they made the right decision. the one on the right looks better here but would be totally creepy in the movie when he's moving around. still, the movie looks like shit and the best it can do is break even. it might be a gigantic flop. nobody cares about sonic anymore and the movie itself doesnt even look good. there's no good reason people would watch it."
gaming,I had this as my wallpaper for months
gaming,Halo is coming to steam soon 🙂
gaming,I was so disappointed by that game when I got it...traded it in.
gaming,better than the movie
gaming,Still better looking than the trailer version.
gaming,I mean they dont make them every year at least
gaming,"That's such a stupid ""let's make comic book superhero costumes but in a realistic way"" idea and I'm not sure if I love it or hate it."
gaming,"52 year old here.  Slower reflexes, Much poorer vision.  But I have a better perspective on what is fun and what isn't."
gaming,LOL at the booty pic - what a loser.
gaming,Coolest shirt ever! :D
gaming,"I grew up when all these games were relevant, but only played half life 1... never finished it :/"
gaming,"I believe so, but it is only a matter of time until they stop offering it. If you're only interested in the popular multiplayer games like mk8 or smash then I would advise against it because they have been ported to the switch. However the wii u is very convenient for watching Netflix and Crunchyroll."
gaming,It's uh....UV glasses that are a half inch tall
gaming,"KNACK IS BACK, BAYYYYBY!"
gaming,Just like the movie
gaming,Latina ass is the best ass.
gaming,"&gt; Clearly the plot is just the genesis story of the goggles

FTFY."
gaming,Slice me off a piece of that.
gaming,My old USB is like 8 years old and isnt working with hakchi ce. So I got a new one. The 64gb I bought is like 10 dollars
gaming,OH FUCK OH SHIT MOM COME PICK ME UP IM FUCKIN’ SCARED!
gaming,"And see, this sets the stage for the SEGA Cinematic Universe"
gaming,I doubt the stores down south stock what the ones up north do in the winter time.
gaming,Yep. These games were so much fun.
gaming,Yeah this is what has inspired me to look.. Fanatical has a bundle with 1 and 2 and another for 9.99 might get this.. Anything else?
gaming,They let visitors play for 90 minutes so expect a lot of streamers to be streaming the game right now. There will probably be a few who do no commentary and upload videos to YouTube.
gaming,Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is good. Bioshock 1 and Infinite. Wolfenstein games. Serious Sam is more like old school run and gun Doom. Rage. I liked STALKER games.
gaming,This is another sonic for hire episode
gaming,"Thanks, I'd been looking for this and couldn't find it."
gaming,Sometime I hop on a motorcycle and just roam across the country side for hours.
gaming,"Ahh right, have you tried GTA V online yet? I don’t have the game, just seen videos"
gaming,"You feel like saying: “look man, I’m wearing deadric armor. It shouldn’t technically exist in this dimension. I’ve raided every dwarven city and cave full of things that would make you shit your pants. I’m the archmage in winter college, the leader of the thieves guild and the companions. I just got done sucking the soul out of a fucking dragon. Now think, you really want to insist upon your toll?”"
gaming,"Oooo is this like MYST ?

A game I played as a kid and had no clue what to do? (Yes I'm older now and I'm better at puzzlss haha)"

gaming,valve use to have it on lock back in the day as did blizzard they both have fallen so far in the passing years it brings a tear to my eye
gaming,All hype was created by gamers themselves...  followed by temper tantrums when they don't get what they want.  Of course a mobile game was their main announcement... they had nothing else to announce.  They have been bleeding WoW for almost 2 decades.  No one should pretend to be surprised that they had nothing much to say.

gaming, Still better than the CGI sonic
gaming,"Big yikes from me. I hate 90% of the boardgame/casual game industry. It's easy to make games with massive RNG and they appeal to people who don't actually care about the games they play.

I grew up playing chess, I find Catan with it's dice rolling decisions and stupid politicking to be anything but engaging or entertaining.

Edit: Just want to add that any version of Munchkin and the like is dogshit^1000"

gaming,"I'm sure it is, and I am happy for you man. 

But right now my partner plays on xbox also, my 2 closest friends play on xbox. The 3 yanks who I play RL and Apex with are all on xbox and (one also on PC) 

I used to love PC gaming for warframe and ARMA particularly, but I would rather just play a console. I see the advantages and right now, I just find console gaming more relaxing.

Sidebar: PC gamers: like a Jehovahs Witness doing overtime ;-)"
gaming,"The PS4 is cool, but I can't give up PVP exclusives for single player exclusives. Gears and Halo are legendary when it comes to satisfactory headshots. If you make the console war about hardware and not the exclusives then you seriously just need to let it go and get a PC.

gaming,"Well, MCC is supposed to be coming to steam at some point, soooooo"
gaming,"Try table top simulator, it's a great way to play them online. You can also try out some single player variants of coop boardgames like Gloomhaven. I personally play
Gloomhaven all the time solo and it's feels exactly like playing a video game on your table. When you get some people that wanna join its simple to throw them into a campaign with you as your controlling 2 characters anyway."

gaming,Subnautica isn’t multiplayer tho
gaming,No but you clearly assumed it. That much is obvious.
gaming,"Sometimes misery is part of the fun. Just look at the people that play Sekiro or Dark Souls.

At least this is more so based off skill then other table games as well. I've wanted to jump of a bridge after a full game of Phase 10."
gaming,Glad to see they've brought them inline with the rest of their games.
gaming,"I have both, but I find the XBone useless. But I only have the consoles for exclusives. The PS4 was worth the 300+ hours of Persona 5 on its own, plus the hours of Bloodborne, Horizon:Zero Dawn, Spiderman, Dad of Boy...

I have no real comment on the systems. The PS4 just has games I can't play on PC that I *need* to play, and the XBone doesn't."
gaming,Sonic starting his Couch to 5K program.

EDIT: When I say ""good"", I am referring to the storyline, mechanics, gameplay, everything. Graphics look sick."
gaming,"In such a case, the death certificate will say ""flu""."
gaming,More like ahh yeah
gaming,"It took us a good two full games before we really understood the game and now it is one of our groups favorite. Others would include Gloomhaven, Everdell, and we just started to get into Villainous. :)"
gaming,I enjoy the LotR LCG for solo play too. It's better with friends obviously but it functions fine with solo play and has a lot of ways to tune the difficulty.
gaming,Could it be possible that exposure to the chaos emeralds could change the appearance of both sonic and Robotnik? Weve already seen the bald and frizzle mustache eggman and what appears to be mushroom hills zone

gaming,"Check out Dansg08 for rpgs, particularly Final Fantasy. He also covers games like Tomb Raider and Unchartered. Great quality content.

His Final Fantasy X HD walkthrough series is a masterpiece."
gaming,It's one of the games on Humble Bundle this month (the digital version). $12 for a handful of digital games is a great deal and you can try it out before dropping $60 on the physical version!
gaming,It’s not a front shop it’s Walmart owned they use their new “gaming pc” line in them
gaming,That’s pretty plausible depending on the type of wireless used.

The point being made was that consoles today are more or less the same power wise, only truly differing when it comes to games.

But no, you have to treat us like we're all idiots who don't understand that companies want to make the most money they can."
gaming,Triforce Heroes on the 3DS comes to mind.
gaming,Stop buying expensive caffeinated drinks and make coffee. It's cheaper and healthier.
gaming,Would he ask sonic to do the plumbing?
gaming,"Likewise. I don’t watch streamers so he didn’t gain a sub here but I’m sure if I just heard of him that people who do watch streamers did as well and I’m sure he gained some of them. 

It was fucking tragic to see the clip."
gaming,"He's actually got 2, but has not placed his mech star.  And he couldn't have gotten it on the current turn since his action marker is on move/upgrade.  In my games I'd probably tell him he's out of luck, it's cheating to not place a star and then go back later and say, oh I forgot let me put one out now since it should always be open knowledge how many stars each player has earned.  I always remind people to place them in my games"
gaming,That was a good breakdown.
gaming,Aaw shucks no problem fellow internet person!
gaming,Who the fuck cares
gaming,"Is it really? That’s nice. 
I may have to open my heart again and take a look. EA has just disappointed on 10/10 of the last 10 games of their I bought.... surely this will be different.... right?"
gaming,"Well like, when you are folding a piece of paper you will eventually end up with a bit that you try to fold, but it folds out a bit because its too short so you gotta glue it or something."
gaming,"At least the newest ones have some fun ideas like your own story mode for your own created character that actually is neat. Just doesn’t really handle that well (imo) and there are microtransactions. But Madden 19 is devoid of life so much that it is pay to win, franchise mode has nothing to offer, and don’t even think about creating your own player because you’re essentially just playing as a coach on the team. 

But to each their own"

gaming,Took me a second.. lol
gaming,"Warframe. I l9ve the game in general, but there is a random ""Wolf of Saturn"" boss that randomly spawns, he is already op, no level cap though."
gaming,Yeah I do the same lol. Although some games I find myself unable to delete for some reason lol like some kinda personal connection even if I haven't played in months. It's crazy because I have a 1TB Xbox so I don't even know how the hell my storage was around 97% full 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
gaming,Not worth it bro
gaming,Well that's what the internet says when I look it up. I guess he made those 16 lines work well.
gaming,"It doesn't really have the same omf though.

The second half of Gen 5 (Black and White 2) could have had a crescendo involving the player character of Black and White 1. It's the only other time two games have been chronologically back to back and geographically similar."
gaming,Oh? I've not had this issue. Just tried 2. Might be some region bs? Sucks in any case.
gaming,"Also, some people don’t realize that not all information is available, so they think that they are calling them out for their stereotyping and stupidity, but in reality they just don’t have enough information to make a solid opinion, and is asking people on an active thread if this is happening anywhere else."
gaming,Fuck that is awesome.
gaming,"One good turn deserves another. They fucked us, we don't give them our money. Simple really. Aside from that, from what I've heard they are getting screwed pretty bad. If a purchase is done anywhere BUT the epic store they still lose the same amount off the top as they would with steam. Most purchases, are coming from 3rd party sales. NOT the epic store. :D Makes me happy."

gaming,Yeah they've been bad in the past few years. I liked madden 19 and 20 looks promising. Also if you dont don't have battlefront 2 they've done a really good job bringing it back plus it's super cheap
gaming,In my country slim with rdr2 is 400€ so i think this deal is pretty good
gaming,"The PS3 and Wii came out around the same time, I went to Best Buy and waited in line (for the Wii) early before they opened. One of the employees prior to opening came out and started handing out tickets and being like 30 people from the front I wasn't sure if I was gonna get one. When the employee got to me she asked Wii or PS3? Apparently I was the first person who said they were there for the Wii but not the only and they moved me and the others there for a Wii to the front of the line and immediately took us inside, we all got boo'd. It was kinda funny."
gaming,"The Trine Trilogy is a fun puzzle/platformer game for three people. Or you know, there's Apex Legends"
gaming,"I'm going to get downvoted for this, and that's OK, but visually, kinda disappointed.  BL2 came out 7 years ago, and this really doesn't look that much different.  I'm not asking for the art style to change, just little things.  Like in the gameplay demo, when the player was walking in water, the water did not move, and the light reflection in the water looked like reflections in the 360/PS3 days.  Also, I'd like to see more stuff in the environments.  There's just so much open space with little peppered in there to fill out the world.  TBH, I'm gonna buy this on day one, but for such a popular franchise and for the first new game on the current generation of hardware, would have liked to see some more attention to detail."

If anything, sell it to individuals at a higher price!!"

gaming,"Its just kind of one of those things you have to accept about these gameolay reveal events.  

The people playing are gonna be intentionally bad because they're told to play in a way that shows off certain things. And if it's a Co-Op game, there's gonna be some cringy dialogue between the two players that sounds nothing like what people in the real world would ever say.   

Could always be worse. Be thankful they didnt go full pseudo-military speak."

gaming,"Sephiroth In Kingdom Hearts 1.  I always see that first attempt that went really well as being similar to beginner’s luck.  You’re just trying whatever you can and seeing what works.  The second try and each try afterward is when you’re trying to develop specific strategies with a more narrow focus.  If it’s a bad strategy, that narrow focus will keep you from fumbling your way in to something that works.

I guess think of it like if your first try is a shotgun blast, your subsequent tries are rifle shots.  Some of the shotgun blast will hit, the rifle will basically be all hit or all miss."
gaming,"question for op: how much did you spend on this game?

gaming,"You knew, or at least, your team promptly told you after the first game, that there is one viable play style for that champion. The ignorance excuse is perfectly reasonable for one game. You said you played for a week, which means you kept playing in a totally incorrect way after it was repeatedly made clear to you that it was incorrect. At that point, you were willfully making the experience bad for your teammates. Selfish includes when doing a tiny amount of work would make everyone in the game have more fun, but you refuse because you either don't care or are too lazy.

I dont have a firm grasp on what that would be but I was just left a little unimpressed by it all. Maybe more diverse skill trees or radically different action skills. Or more interesting/aggressive enemies. Im really not sure.

It looked like the 3rd game in a series and not much more, and like many other AAA games that have come out recently it makes me wonder why it took so long to make."

gaming,"Just wait. My next trick is to bring in the larger cast. Just like in the games, Knuckles will start out as a villain and rival to Sonic, but he will hold that position for longer as I introduce the larger rogue's gallery, along with Sonic's team. There are so many bad guy heel turns in the game series that it's almost embarrassing to try to do them separately, so I'll probably have a bunch of them turn as a group to join the freedom fighters. Sort of a reverse civil war in a sense. Shadow will take over briefly when Knuckles leaves, but Eggman doesn't trust squishies at all any more, and thus sends mecha sonic to ""supplant"" Shadow. Shadow goes rogue entirely, and I think I'd like to give him his own small posse. People who don't like Eggman, but don't want anything to do with Sonic and pals either. They'll do their own thing, and be a third, wildcard force.

The chaos emeralds will come into play at some point. Eggman wants them to power his empire, so naturally Shadow and Sonic don't want him to have them. Knuckles gets covertly turned by Eggman, and while Sonic is beating Shadow and collecting his emeralds, Knuckles steals Sonic's. We get my favorite conflict in comics here- Super Sonic vs. Hyper Knuckles. I could probably go on."

gaming,"Hahaha, yeah, it can get overwhelming. 

I've always had the general level layouts of the game planned out, on paper. For a while it was even on sticky notes on the wall above my development PC. I do plan many things on paper including level layouts and puzzles, but most of it comes down to when I'm actually in there working and fleshing things out. There's so much iteration, so only overtime things really began to come together. I usually focused on finishing one major section of the game at a time and had a ""polish as I go"" attitude (though, bugs always find a way to creep through). Near the end things began to wrap up much faster than anticipated, but it was quite nice to see it do so. 

My only other thing was to never have a 0% day - always get something done, even if it was sending an email or tweeting about the game. I'm a college student in addition to all this, studying computer science, so it can get very overwhelming at times trying to juggle everything at once. I hope this helps/gives some insight!"

gaming,"Similarly, just because they release a product every year where you still just play the sport, doesn't mean that it is broken and has had no advancements made in it.  

I personally don't play sports games, but I've had friends that play the Madden games every year and (generally) rave about the upgrades that come. More complicated seasons and rosters, player creation and athlete recreation, physics, graphics, AI.  Generally speaking, at least a few of these recieve some sort of upgrade when the next year's game comes out, though there is some exception.  

I'm not saying the business model isn't shitty, but they aren't just copy and pasting the new year on the previous game and calling it good, it works for the people who are into it. Same with modern FPS franchises or any other games with this type type of release schedule (Assassin's Creed comes to mind, their early years were of questionable consistency)"

We separated from Fishlabs when we were aggressively taken over, due to us not wanting to follow the mobile F2P model. We lost the GoF IP...so we moved to the PC/console market, and made Everspace.

Everspace is an arcade spaceship shooter with ROGUELIKE elements, so it's still a bit different from our GoF days...but we are working on a new title currently. And we're returning to what we're best at."

gaming,"To be honest the game isn't hard it is just different. Most games within a single genre are easy to pick up because they have similar control schemes, so muscle memory can kick in easily allowing a player to learn the game faster. Of course each and every game has its nuances that need to be learned and differences in mechanics, though they aren't as drastic as Sekiro.

There are aspects that make Sekiro seem hard, the aspects from my perspective are as follows:

1. Subverting player expectations, in most third person hack and slash games and in dark souls (since many players bought sekiro expecting it to play similarly) the most reliable ways to avoid taking damage are jumping (ex DMC5) and dodging (ex Dark souls, DMC5's Trickster for Dante). Sekiro subverts players' expectation as well as their developed muscle memories by punishing those two ways to dodging damage by tightening the number of invincibility frames that these actions have. This is done to promote Parrying, which is tied in many players' mind as something too hard to do because the frames required to parry in most games are usually less forgiving than jumping and dodging (ex Dark Souls once more). So given the perceived notion that parrying is a high skill ceiling action people don't give it a shot, they don't give its timing a shot even though in Sekiro the parry frames are rather generous.
2. The game's progression, all games are about evaluating your options as a player. There is an option that many people relied on in previous dark soils games which is grinding to boost your stats, an option that still exists in Sekiro but in a different way, instead of simply giving you flat stat buffs it gives you passive abilities and active abilities all that will help give you more options. Options that can trivialize some fights (Mikiri counter is the biggest example here). Though some players feel like that is something that takes away their agency, since the stat boosts they want to go for are HP boosts and Damage boosts which are locked behind boss fights/mini boss fights. Giving the feeling that some bosses are impossible. To me these are players that aren't evaluating their options. Like someone who is used to play arcade racing with minimal braking through corners and moving onto a simulation racer, each game expects something different from you, you can't keep trying to force the playstyle that worked in arcade racers to a simulation racer.
3. Removal of summons, many players including me have used summons every now and then while going against a tough boss in Dark Souls. Which come to think of it is a way to modulate difficulty based on how many summons you get. So Sekiro takes away some options away from players that they expected to be there under false pretenses, which isn't the game's fault.

This all culminates into the following, some players were not willing to alter their playstyle to match the game, some were fighting muscle memory which can be frustrating and others feel that they were stripped out of options without taking into considerations the extra options that the game provides them."

gaming,"I love the art style, and I get the restrictions with it in terms of differentiating it from previous titles.  Part of the reason games like LOZ Wind Waker still look so good years later.  I just want to see more stuff scattered about.  Replaying BL2 right now, having a blast, but so much of the map is just wide open space.  Toss some more plants in there, that kinda thing.  Again, beyond excited to get this new game on day one."
gaming,"Personally, I'm not a fanboy of either. I have both. This joke biting at Microsoft is less to me about the ""console wars"", and more about how bad Microsoft fucked up this Gen, from the announcement of the system at E3 with the DRM debacle to the lack of securing any meaningful exclusives that make the system worth having over a PS4. This, after the 360 absolutely crushed it last Gen, is just one of those, ""Jesus, how did they fuck up so bad,"" kinda things."

I mean to go from coding web apps to a game like this seems like a BIG jump, but is it really? How does code translate to 3D? Lots of linear algebra perhaps? Is your game actually code heavy or do game engines take on the heavy lifting for you? I really just can’t phantom how a college student could develop a game all on their own. I’m in awe, really."
gaming,"The main stage in itself is going to generate hype.  That's Blizzard saying ""This is the thing you should be most excited about.""  Then they took the thing they should have know virtually nobody would care about and plopped it up there.

And the thing is, they *did* have other announcements.  Were they minor?  Sure.  But they were no more minor than the mobile game and at least they would be targeting the actual demographic.  Warcraft 3 Reforged would have been well received on the main stage.  Details on WoW classic probably would have excited many.  Hell even just having the Overwatch announcements with the new hero, or even the new Hearthstone expansion would have been better received.  Hell, even HotS announcing their new hero and such would have likely been better received than a Chinese mobile game.

They didn't have anything *major* to announce, sure.  But they had a lot of minor ones to choose from and they chose what would be the *worst* thing to put up there.  There's a time and a place for everything.  There's a massive audience for mobile games, but you don't take a bunch of your most hardcore fans and basically tell them ""And for our biggest announcement, we are shifting focus to mobile this year!"".  Knowing your demographic is marketing 101.  Seriously, if they had WC3 reforged up on the stage people probably would have eaten it up for nostalgia reasons alone, and Blizzcon 2018 would probably have been regarded as rather positive, if not a little lackluster.

And because of all this, Immortal which likely would have been played by a lot of fans if lowkey announced is instead going to be a general meme."

gaming,Judging by this subreddit? That it's available on Steam
gaming,"*Sonic Generations* and *Sonic Mania* were meant more as a celebration of Sonic's glory days and are basically ""*Best Of*"" compilations (*Mania* being like a *Best Of* compilation with solid unreleased tracks added), and I have to keep pointing out to people that the last time Sonic was genuinely original and not pandering to the nostalgia crowd was either *Sonic Boom* or *Sonic Colors*. There's only so many times you can keep remaking Green Hill Zone and get away with it. The past ten years of Sonic games have literally been him chasing the three-odd years he was actually unironically great on a 30-year-old console. What has Mario given us in the same time? *Super Mario Galaxy 2*, *Super Mario Maker*, and *Super Mario Odyssey*, among others. 

And then you bring up the atrocities of the past ten years: *Sonic and the Black Knight*, *Sonic Free Riders*, *Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric*, and *Sonic Forces*, which range from ""aggressively mediocre to the point of being filth"" all the way to ""electronic filth"". Hell, people even put *Rise of Lyric* on the same level of awful as *Sonic 06*, and I don't think I need to exaggerate how pathetic it is a single franchise could have *two* such games under its wing released within 8 years of each other. So in a manner, no wonder Sonic focuses so much on the grunge years. At the same time, I wish Sega went back to 1994 and thought, ""You know what would be great? 1995"". Maybe then they could progress this damn franchise and make new classics while avoiding what made the older 32-bit and 3D games terrible. 

You know what I heard Sonic Team has been interested in doing? A *Sonic Adventure* remake. That sounds cool. Their past four *Sonic Adventure* rereleases have been exercises in laziness by being barely improved over the original and continuously worse in some way. A full-fledged remake using modern technology and understanding why the original game wasn't as great as it could have been would be wonderful. 

But at this point, I fully expect Sonic Team to trot out Big the Goddamn Cat unironically in such a title and even try making him into a memetic sensation through ""cool"" gameplay variations on fishing or ""badass"" moments, and then their attempts fall flat when critics say Big is ""somewhat endearing, but utterly pointless"" with more caustic critics declaring that Sega truly and utterly cannot learn from its mistakes and would rather double down on its problems than take actual steps forward, trimming the fat, and creating a wholly cohesive product. Because *Sonic Adventure* could have been the classic Sonic fans once thought it was if it was just the classic trio with maybe E-102 added, but all of the extraneous bullshit kept it down whereas *Super Mario 64* seems to get better with age precisely because it avoided all of that nonsense. Same with *Sonic Adventure 2*. Sonic and Shadow stages were great, if not fantastic, but the rest of the game was hit-or-miss to downright dire. If it were just those two characters but there were 15 stages for each character, we'd be talking of *Sonic Adventure 2* as being one of the greatest games of the 2000s. 

These are obvious solutions, and yet I (and actual Sonic fans) have had to watch Sega grossly mishandle what should be such a surefire success, a literal *Rolling Stones of video games* kind of franchise. Hell, Sonic is so well designed and memorable that he's still popular *despite the past 15 years of irrelevancy*. If the franchise were just in more competent hands, he'd probably rival or even surpass Mario. But that's not what's going to happen, and Sega's a much bigger company than people realize (IIRC, they actually get most of their money from arcade machines), so critically panned mascot titles aren't going to lead to them selling the IP any time soon.

gaming,"Game engines take on a huge amount of heavy lifting. I knew almost nothing about programming when I started this game other than some basic visual scripting, and through its development and my career as a computer science student I was able to learn quite a lot (such as object oriented programming, linear algebra, and more). I wouldn't say its very math heavy, but knowing how to work with vectors is probably nice. I use Unreal Engine 4, it helps a lot and the documentation/support is pretty dang great. Can only imagine Unity is the same too. 

I'm beginning console ports though and for that there is a bit more heavy backend code involved that I have to setup, but if you're a web developer I'd imagine its quite easy. Just download the engine and try it out, there is many tutorials to help learn! :)"

It's a dick move to do what epic and the publishers/devs they bought out did. It is not a dick move to make a point with your wallet. The only negative that comes from such an act is not being able to play a game you would have liked.

But seriously they could choose to never buy this game simply because they don't like the number 3. Who gives a shit, it's their money."

And yes, they're playing up the ""not from Earth"" angle, but it's still a pretty drastic thing to include Game Sonic in a movie with real actors if you're not going for a Roger Rabbit vibe. And to be clear, I'm not saying the version they went with is *good*, but it does fit into the world better. There are still ways they could have improved him (tan fur on his arms would have been good, but let's not start that argument).

Honestly, for all the people complaining about Sonic, I'm surprised no one seems to be complaining about Jim Carrey looking nothing like Eggman bar a few seconds in the trailer stinger. He doesn't really *act* like Eggman much either."

gaming,"IMO this reply makes this post much better than the others on here I've seen of people advertising their game, with stuff like ""I'm nervous to show u guys this haha"" and then only replying to flattering/""THIS LOOKS AWESOME"" comments. 

Taking the time to explain your process and listen to those that have questions or insights goes a long way into building a loyal fanbase; it is greatly appreciated."

gaming,"Yeah, just like the chat said ""killed by spider"". The doesn't mean that it was all done by the flu or the spider. Most people (as they should) would include the full picture, and the flu would probably take the backseat because AIDS was the real culprit."

Edit: confirmed lol Im wrong. Ill accept the downvotes."

gaming,"Hey, remember how EA gobbled up studios and IPs so that they can squeeze the life out of them for cash while slapping the EA logo on everything and only have stuff released by them?

Is this what Epic is gonna do too? It wasn't enough to bribe developers, so they're outright buying the studio? Are they also gonna ruin Psyonix like how EA ruined Westwood Studios?"
gaming,"I actually have my main gaming setup in my office, then have a steam link which is a small sized device you can plug into your TV or anywhere in the house. Then stream your games as if you say in front of your PC. Makes for a great console like experience but better due to bump in graphics. In this such scenario split screen is great fun and literally no different than why console users like splitscreen."

gaming,Dam I check a couple hours later and the crowd has rallied behind him.
gaming,"For me... it's weird.

I like the idea of board games. I like DnD. Holy shit does combat always take WAY too long with people trying to min-max their movement, attack, chances for AoO from enemies etc. Fuck you, you don't need an hour to make a 15 foot movement to stab a goblin, just do it. 

Same with settlers of katan, and  similar extreme board games. Plan your moves between turns, each turn shouldn't take an hour. Makes a 'fun start' to a board game, really shitty after 3 or 4 turns and we're barely 1 round through the table, an hour in."
gaming,"It's fine. It's a bunch of baggies in a big cardboard box and that's pretty much the ideal situation. There's a special plastic container for the minis, so that's good."
gaming,"Fable 3 is a great chill happy experience, would recommend."
gaming,"wow, the FNaF movie graphics look great!"
gaming,Or one controller and the other uses a mouse and keyboard.
gaming,"I think the appeal of the Vita is the JRPG library. I'm not huge into the genre, though absolutely loved Gravity Rush. However, that's on PS4 now. 

Two of the most highly regarded (and best selling) titles on Vita that haven't been ported to other systems are Persona 4 Golden and Uncharted: Golden Abyss. I haven't played either, but Uncharted got good reviews and I keep seeing Persona brought up as a must have for Vita owners."
gaming,"Okay but is anyone else actually looking forward to the film, cause I am"
gaming,"not a chance, steam workshop and everything has been built for years. It will get ported. If they take it off steam basically all pros will quit, and no amount of money from epic would change that."
gaming,They just fucked Sonic up. He doesn’t look like Sonic. He looks like a person in a blue fur suit.
gaming,"The screenshots of sonic definitely look awful, but in the actual trailer, he doesn't actually seem that bad when the whole thing is in motion. 


Not as good as Pikachu, but definitely not '93 super Mario Goomba."
gaming,They still have cosmetics that you can buy in game for money though.
gaming,"Ah Gough, I see it now. Thank you"
gaming,"OP never mentioned ownership of the esports arena. He or she simply asked if anyone else’s Walmart had one in it. 

The esports arena is inside a Walmart store. Fact. Therefore there is an esports arena *in the Walmart store*.

While Walmart generally rents out space to various companies, even local businesses sometimes, they also have standing relationships with some businesses, like Subway. So if I saw an esports arena in one Walmart I might also be curious if they are going to be popping up everywhere or if it’s just a local thing. I think that’s what OP might have wanted to know. I don’t think OP wanted an unsolicited comment on stuff everyone already knows."
gaming,Ive experienced no loss. Supporting evil is always the losing position.
gaming," to a large amount of people it matters. Its not about the exclusivity exactly, its Epic store buying there way into the market Via exclusives instead of makeing a good product and improving on it to earn its place in the market. It's more about shitty business practices at the cost to consumers and the industry."
gaming,"Maybe some of you will one day understand that cosplaying is not about just the hours spent on preparing a suit, sewing it yourself, or about the accuracy of how your body type matches the characters, or even the accuracy of the outfit itself. It's about wanting to play in a costume, to play around the fantasy of being a character. Having fun with it is what matters. I hope to one day see less hate towards people who just do what they love."
gaming,"You can play both the board game and digital versions solo.

I play a ton of board games — can confirm that your mistake was playing GOT. Scythe is a fourth of the time and rules. You can even get simpler; try out **Ethnos** for a stupid-simple game to teach that is hilariously fun and goes up to 6 players."

gaming,It's not on steam tho. I'll wait
gaming,"My PC has a dongle that allows wireless xbox controllers to connect to it and is hooked up to a projector.  It's actually really easy.  Most wired xbox controllers also have USB adapters to plug into PCs.  

Realistically the most difficult thing about developing spltscreen for a game is the fact that the machine has to render multiple instances of the game which can be quite taxing on the hardware making it so PCs are actually generally easier to get splitscreen working on than consoles which are much more limited/restricted in terms of hardware."
gaming,"No, epic acquired the rocket league guy, not rocket league acquired the dance guy from epic."
gaming,What are the odds it goes free to play?
gaming,"I'm not saying you wouldn't have been better off, but you don't lose for taking a lot of turns. You lose for getting caught. If you don't have to ignite, your chances of getting caught go down. If the people you doused are dead, the chances of an investigator seeing doused people goes down. Your chances of survival goes up. Assuming town isn't rando-ing (not always the best assumption, I know) you might just live a little longer.  


Would it be better if mafia had hit all the other targets while you coincidentally doused everyone else and town hung all the mafia? Sure. Ideal even. But I'm just saying that there's still ways it works to your favor that you can take advantage of if you realize it and use it. Town of Salem is all about evolving with the changing situation."

gaming,"Not OP and you may scoff at my principles but yes. I am in a position in my life where I simply do not care if there's some game I can't play. Gaming is still important to me but I have lots of other games. I absolutely refuse to buy Metro on the Epic Store and I was really looking forward to playing that. The first two are among my favourite games ever. I may get it on Steam next year. Or, simply out of spite, never buy it. As an individual I know I don't make a difference but it's the only sign of protest I can make to these kinds of moves that do not benefit the customer at all."

gaming,“He.. he’s right behind me isn’t he?”
gaming,Lady Butterfly in Sekiro.
gaming,Hi. There is almost 6 month from post. How is it going now? Is it profitable? what improvements done? Can you add fresh photos?
gaming,What about the enhanced collar bone and the muscular neck
gaming,Mk11 and cant decide if I want to play dragons dogma or darksiders on switch.
gaming,"Oooh, that makes sense.  That's a relief. /s"
gaming,It's upside down aswell?!
gaming,"&gt;exclusive to mobile

Even fallout shelter is multiplatform"
gaming,I honestly think some stuff people make is just intentionally awful. And Sonic has been a victim of... terrible terrible things.
gaming,Same way it does on console?
gaming,"Because he calls it 'his remote' , I STILL wouldn't connect it."
gaming,"I hate the seasonal stocking the major hardware stores do. 

I needed to get a water heat cable (basically an electric heater you put on pipes to prevent them from freezing). It was a seasonal item, every store was out of stock, and they weren’t restocking until the next year. 

Had to spend about 3 hours driving around town until I found a Mom &amp; Pop hardware store with one in stock. And now that store is out of business."
gaming,"Epic owns Rocket League now. As soon as the contract with Steam expires, you can guarantee they won't renew it."
gaming,For some reason I tried to figure out which Space Marine Chapter this was.
gaming,"1920’s Steampunk. Eastern Europa. Send out dudes to get resources to upgrade your infrastructure. Control a main character to choose your path at optional quest locations. Build mechs to defend and conquer territory.

If you’ve played a lot of games, it’s a breeze to teach and play. If you’re newer to games, it’s certainly something you could grasp, but you gotta really want it.

If you’re newer to board games, Ethnos has a similar theme but is dead simple. Viticulture is by the same publisher and has a wine-producing theme. Carcassonne is a classic introduction game that features map building for points and being smarmy about taking over plots of land.

/r/boardgames is a blast. Lemme know if you have more questions :)"
gaming,"Jim's going to be at all the con's now, knowing all about Sonic.  It was like his favorite thing ever.  Sonic 2 was his favorite and he even helped produced the film which was the magnum opus of his 40 years long career."
gaming,Just wait until Epic starts requiring mandatory EGS exclusive deals in order to use the Unreal engine
gaming,"I've been to probably 30+ Walmart locations throughout North America.  Most of them are full of hair salons, photo services, travel agencies and food vendors at those front stores.  This is a pretty rare / cool find and you somehow find a way to turn it into case of ignorance?"
gaming,Is that For Honor at first?
gaming,"They’re actually comparable in depth — I find Scythe to be a bit easier to teach, actually!"
gaming,I feel like $.99 cosmetic DLC packs count as microtransactions
gaming,"The lack of progression can deter some people, but ultimately is required for a game like SoT to allow the mingling of old and new players as well as keeping combat fair in a shared world"
gaming,"You guys think they're sweet tho, right?"
gaming,You were driven over 42 times?
gaming,"Pikachu, other than being visibly furry, looks just like Pikachu from the games. His proportions are the same, he general shape is the same, and all of his readily identifiable features are the same. Same thing with the other Pokemon: Charizard has scales, but he's a lizard so that makes sense. Jigglypuff has hair/fur, and that's weird because I always thought she was some sort of flesh balloon, but she otherwise looks fine. etc.

Sonic is just wrong in every way. Coloration is right, but his proportions are all wrong, his eye shape is wrong, his ears are wrong, his mouth/nose are wrong, and his damn shoes are wrong."
gaming,"Related, I got really into nail polish to help me break the habit of biting my nails. Don't want to ruin them when they are pretty!"
gaming,"If you don't care about the launcher and only care about the store, you could always just get it off Humble Bundle."
gaming,"Yeah, I’m playing God of War next. 

Just so many triple A games are open world. But you know, maybe I should get a girlfriend and quit gaming. Then when I get sick of her, I’ll come back to gaming. 

Life is beautiful!"
gaming,But also the texture on his model is just weird. Doesn't look as sleek as sonic should.
gaming,"That Tiny Tina DLC from Borderlands 2 was 12/10, so many references!!"
gaming,"He's not a monster, though. He's just a dude from another dimension, though I have a feeling they're going a different route in this movie."
gaming,That's not how stocks work lol
gaming,Litterally the only difficult event in any Pokemon game
gaming,"I just recently started getting into board games the past year or so.  I even bought a custom built board game table.  But I’ve only got 2 other ppl so far, which has been fun but we really need a 4th"
gaming,"But, what epic is doing is a form of monopoly. They are the ONLY ones selling metro, selling borderlands. If they made it an actual competition where there were no exclusives and both steam and metro sold the games then 1. Epic would have to step up their development game for their launcher to make it equal to steam. 2. Steam would then have to start innovating themselves to stay ""on top"". 3. Epic might see that steam will always be on top as far as innovation goes so they get better sales on certain games to get gamers to use their launcher.

It's all about competition, and exclusives do not make good competition. Epic is trying to make it so you need both epic AND steam. Whereas they should make it to where you need either epic OR steam."
gaming,DO NOT SELL THE MAJORA'S MASK CART. Especially if it's the vinyl. It's hella pricey.
gaming,in GTA V I got bored and started following the Michael daughter in her car after a quest ended. After a few minutes went to rob it for the lulz and pulled a guy out of it. Weirdest bug totally unplayable
gaming,Trying to get into it. It seems sorta difficult and tedious at times. I have no clue what's a main quest and what isnt. But still trying to get into it
gaming,"all of these are characters from DS1, beside the dude in front middle. he is DS3, seems very out of place."
gaming,"I noticed a slide mechanic was added but I stopped playing after BL2. Was the slide mechanic also in the last iteration, The Pre-Sequel?"
gaming,"again, I dont think any amount of money can change that, they have stated that epic gas given thousands for esports money, and 80% of pros would quit if its off steam. that just hurts everyone"
gaming,Valve never really did anything that made me question their monopoly. And they earned that monopoly by having a good platform. And they've not had a monopoly for years. There are dozens of other launchers and many many successful PC games are not on Steam. Epic has entered the scene and is applying a bit of force on their customers and that didn't sit right with me. I'm surprised that a fair number of developers and publishers are OK with this but money talks and I guess someone did the math and determined that a big share of the revenue is worth the bad PR and probably selling fewer copies. I'm curious to know how well Metro sold on the EGS.
gaming,"You start Scythe with three figures on the board. Only a few decks of cards need to be shuffled. Setup is probably five minutes max.

The rules could certainly be considered complicated, but there are lots of easier games to learn out there that are just as fun! A few I’d recommend are Splendor, Dominion, and Ethnos."
gaming,And seeing that picture that reworked proportions did wonders too. It's hilarious to see this trailer vs what we've seen in Detective Pikachu
gaming,Many people would tell you to hurry and go get the witcher 3... I included. One of the best games I've ever played. You're in for it treat!
gaming,apparently Psyonix is merging into Epic games. today is a sad day.
gaming,The game isn’t even out yet
gaming,"Oh come on, fuck right off"
gaming,I think the hairiness is what's throwing me off. The game model looked so shiny and this guy looks like a teddy bear.
gaming,I cant believe this guys owns his own wal mart
gaming,"I think I’m different. Downvote if you want, but I didn’t think the images of Sonic were any worse than some of the Pokemon (jigglypuff, mr mime) until people started saying it was bad. 

As if other people’s opinion changed what I thought of the image. Maybe It’s because I noticed how human like his face is, but that’s me really pay attention.

The trailer was cheesy but not the worst I’ve seen either."
gaming,is Apex no longer a big viewer?  Did it die down a bit?
gaming,"That would be no different than what they were in Borderlands 2, which no one had a problem with."
gaming,Why would Epic continue to sell Rocket League through steam when they have their own launcher and are trying to get more people to use it? it just doesn't make sense.
gaming,"The spines of hedgehogs are made of keratin; the same stuff hair and fingernails are made of. It's not that much of a stretch that his spines also produce hairs (provided the spines are meant to be like hedgehog spines), especially since he's not supposed to accurately portray a real hedgehog.

Heck, their spines are even referred to as ""modified hairs""."
gaming,I wish people were of the same mind here and we could get EVERY single gamer to not buy microtransactions. We just need people to stop pumping money into them and eventually they'll just go away.
gaming,"Sure it's not plug in and play as it is on console, but the reward of putting the time is totally worth it.

In terms of cost, consoles are kinda like mobile phone contracts, they get you in the long run and lure you in with the low upfront cost. Like you pay monthly for online, pay more for your games, then have to rebuy the console each generation and then they proceed to resell you games you have already bought and then as a result get worse graphics and limitations which just aren't present on PC."

gaming,I’m a sucker for mmo survival/crafting games.  I recently jump back into Conan Exiles.

gaming,Been meaning to pick this game up for the past couple months.  Just haven’t got around to it.
gaming,"Yea I saw that... could be good or absolutely shit. Time will tell I guess but I really hope epic doesn’t ruin this game, been my favorite for a while"
gaming,Why don’t you upload it as slowmo then you nut
gaming,"Negative.  If you have a Steam version, it will still be supported."
gaming,DEA Obsidian good BUGthesda BAD???
gaming,I would go with some pair of HyperX's then
gaming,But is there really a difference between me pre ordering the game a month or so before release (when the game is already done) vs just buying it day 1?
gaming,"Hey, that sounds wise! You should take that on a talk show circuit."
gaming,Best gaming universe ever
gaming,You're honestly hard pressed to even find people selling them smaller than that anymore.
gaming,Sonic has so many back stories its insane. When I grew up he was from planet Mobius.
gaming,The irony of this thread is too much.
gaming,"Because Pikachu stuck to the design that made him famous. He looks like a CGI version of himself from the video games. They legit tried to make a fucking cartoon character like Sonic look ""real""."
gaming,"Oh it looks amazing! Sorry, I didn't mean to downplay how awesome it is! :D"
gaming,Is this just art or is this a real advertisement?
gaming,"Mine has a demo switch that has had a ""you need to upgrade the controller firmware"" message on screen for the last month or so"

What a save!"
gaming,"I went over to a friend's place once for a casual board game night - it was just her, her fiance and I. We were browsing their game library when the fiance suggested his favourite game, Scythe. Cue a whole evening of him strategically dismantling the two of us while we loosely grasp at our vague concept of the rules."
gaming,"Idk, I almost can't help but feel this weirdness in the design was done purposefully.  Jim Carrey as Eggman?  James Marsden reacting the same way the Internet did?  Something seems weird about it"
gaming,"Tbh buying it on steam once its out is a better sign of protest, since otherwise they dont know you are protesting. This way they know youre against the Epic Store and just waited for Steam"
gaming,That's all women these days. Do you hate women? Or face masks
gaming,"A meme, how cute. Did mommy give you permission to be on Reddit today, honey?"
gaming,OH SHIT HE'S CALLED EGGMAN BECAUSE HE'S SHAPED LIKE AN EGG
gaming,"Sonic is too real. While Pikachu's body and textures look real, his form is still exactly like his anime or game counterpart. Sonic takes the realism *too* far. They changed his design to make him more real, but that's precisely what makes him look scary to us."
gaming,Sonic has people teeth.  That's it.  Sonic shouldn't have people teeth....
gaming,"No, he's a monster. You and the other villagers should get your torches and pitchforks"
gaming,"If you already have RL on steam you can still play it on there, right? You don’t have to buy it again?"
gaming,I’ve played it about 3 with my friend and I always choose the mage lady. Don’t know her name.

Edit: it appears they are going to do it."
gaming,"I always find it great to go back to older games that I didn't get chance to play yet, as tbh the gaming industry is in a weird place atm and i feel the triple A scene is a bit lackluster apart from the obvious heavy hitters like God of war, but they are few and far between. Go back and play some of the epics from the PS3 and 360 era"
gaming,No. It wasn't. It's new to the series.
gaming,I really don't like playing retro cabinet arcade games but I have to admit that they're pretty fun when you're tipsy.
gaming,Donkey Kong Country was amazing for this.  Sometimes it was cool to just set the controller down and get lost in the music and amazing atmosphere.
gaming,"I mean, Sonic is from another dimension. He's not a mutated version of an Earth hedgehog or anything like that. I can suspend disbelief since he's not meant to be an Earth hedgehog.

Also, there is a [type of fish](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/animals/sheepshead-fish-facts-fish-human-teeth.html) in our real world that does have teeth just like humans do, so an otherwordly creature with human-like teeth isn't that much of a stretch when things other than humans in the real world have them.

Hell, every alien in the MCU seems to have human-like teeth, and that doesn't bother anyone?

Edit: Ya'll so fucking nitpicky. I'm sick of hearing about Sonic. If you hate it so much then shut up about it and let it die. You're just giving it free publicity."
gaming,Here a lesson in trickery

gaming,"Even from The Onion this is silly. Rockstar hasn't milked the online market for RDR2 nearly long enough to start working on 3. I mean... Fuck, GTAV is like 10 years old and they're still printing money from shark cards."
gaming,"I mean, his lore is all over the place. Originally he was a hedgehog who's dad was killed by toxic waste and was transformed by Dr. Kintobor, who was Dr. Robotnik before going all crazy (who was actually specifically a skinny guy, for people complaining that Carrey is too skinny to play a pre-robotnik robotnik). The idea of Dr. Kintobor actually stuck around after the ""Sonic's dad dies"" story arc went away in the production of the first game, and while it didn't get into the games he IS in the comics.

[https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor\_Ovi\_Kintobor](https://sonic.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Ovi_Kintobor)  


In the trailer you actually see Carrey wearing glasses similar to Kintobor's glasses, before later on sporting goggles reminiscent of the Eggman and the crazier mustache."

gaming,"Hey man! Remember this talk? I’ve been waiting for the Index reveal like you suggested. Well sounds like it’s out! Unfortunately that price tag of $1k is Really steep. Enough to make me realize I really need to be sure about this. That’s a big price tag, but I have been excited about VR since you told me about it. What are your thoughts on the reveal and cost of the full setup? As a reminder I’ve never really played VR, not a serious gamer but play Minecraft (lol) and like games when I find time and find a good game. I need to buy a new PC too."
gaming,Agreed. It's super easy to grab a still of a CGI character making a stupid face and rag on it. The one of Sonic that keeps circulating around doesn't look nearly as bad when you actually watch the scene in motion and only see him make that face for 1/4 of a second.
gaming,"Jesus, the job of that website is to display gifs. Why is it so bloated."
gaming,"Yes, this introduces the shit console players were dealing with for years to pc and thats bad."
gaming,Often goes on sale for $10
gaming,If you DON'T have a steam version will you be able to buy one? Or are they gonna pull a fast one on us and take it off steam do you think?
gaming,That guy being skewered in the top left is giving me PTSD about trying to navigate Anor Londo
gaming,"I know this is a week old, so I'm sorry but I loved that game. It's still actually available via emulator"
gaming,Yeah all the people that don't make those choices should lose their job
gaming,9.5 out of 10. Armrests would really finish this piece
gaming,"The difference is the Pokémon movie is staying true to it's source material.  Pikachu looks like Pikachu, albeit furry, and all the other Pokémon shown thus far are easily recognizable for what they are.  

Movie Sonic looks nothing like any other Sonic portrayal, and it's so far off base that it's unsettling."
gaming,"&gt; Wal Mart has far better meat than

Oh no. Either you must have stumbled upon the one mythical walmart that was of good quality, or you were buying the  pre-packaged stuff. Every single time I've bought fresh meat or produce from walmart it's gone rancid within a day or two and when cooked is just kind of gross and clearly bad quality cuts."
gaming,Look at the difference in the eyes too
gaming,I don't even have a system with a drive lol bought no man's sky ps4 steel book and don't even have a ps4. Just like how they look in my shelf plus really enjoy the artwork they typical with. Digital editions I'd only ever consider if it had serious amount of digital artwork with it.
gaming,Get away from EA fam. There are plenty of good AAA games that don't require $200 in DLC to enjoy.
gaming,This probably has a lot more to do with BFA.

gaming,"God I am really starting to despise epic,  fuck offffffffffffff"
gaming,"Apparently (still not 100% confirmed) the press release says its only gonna stop being sold on the steam store, but at least people still can play if they already have it. Fuck tho thats actually suprising to me, didn't think they would actually do that. Well shit where the pitchforks at, Cause if that is true Im genuinely suprised at this."
gaming,And those were called DLC.
gaming,If you put the game down and come back a while later you can trick yourself/the game into thinking it's your first time again and get that beginner's luck
gaming,"""But, but we at epic aren't the bad guys. STEAM is the bad guy, look at him with his 30% cut! Seeee?"""
gaming,"Get a 3DS and install custom firmware on it, buy a flash cartridge for it too and have *all the games all the time*."

gaming,Game industry shits on players again
gaming,"You missed the chance to say “make their new store EPIC” you shant get my surprised face, but still was a little funny otherwise."
gaming,omg GEX! I haven't heard that game in a grip.
gaming,"Huh, cool info! Based on the trailer it seems that Sonic may have been hanging around Earth for a while (there's a scene where we see a bunch of old, worn out shoes in what appears to be where Sonic lives), so maybe they will use some of that background and Carrey's Robotnik may have more of a backstory than we think."
gaming,"This is what Arcades have become.

I miss playing SamSho on that Neo Geo arcade machine so much."
gaming,Just let my boy die already. Sonic has been through enough....he doesn’t deserve this.
gaming,Where am I looking at?
gaming,I think arcades are going to make a comeback with VR.  We will see really expensive systems that people can't afford by themselves.  Just like with arcades everyone would go because the machines were like 10k.
gaming,"Not only that, but exclusivity is a cancer on gaming."

There are people out there who'll say Civ only rakes 30 minutes for ""their group"" and they got a perfect score in Pandemic legacy so have a house rule to make it harder.


There probably are people out there who are that ""good"" but I doubt I'd enjoy the sessions as much."

gaming,"I made a few gum wrapper swords at work while on boring conference calls. Not as good as yours, though."

I love the trilogy but this one is a masterpiece.

gaming,"In the actual board game, you can play solo using the Automata. In the digital version, you can play solo against AI."
gaming,That's pretty hot. Is it possible to clap its cheeks? asking for a friend.
gaming,"I think the issue is that Micro transactions is such a vague term that can be used in many different situations.  I wouldn't really consider the BL2 style to be micro-transactions.  If a game lets me buy some form of currency in differently priced bundles, which would encourage me to spend more to get a better deal on said bundles, that is what i consider a micro-transaction.  If a game is offering me a 1 time purchase of a cosmetic item for 99 cents,  and also later includes said cosmetics into the GOTY edition, I don't really see it as a MTX at that point."
gaming,"If you already own it, I’m pretty sure you can. We will find out more information in a few weeks/months, when Epic makes the decision."
gaming,Well if they did they wouldn't spend hundreds of dollars on pointless cosmetic stuff :/
gaming,Ludiculo looks good though. Well he's ugly but that's how he's supposed to be.
gaming,A cover system. No crouch button.
gaming,"Yikes, that was a trip."
gaming,"Can I have some sauce, please?"
gaming,Wasn't there a bug with Steam where it would randomly play in-game audio files? Maybe it's that?
gaming,No one likes micro transactions. We are trying to get them to go away. They are bad for games. Your logic is flawed
gaming,"The community is pretty big on memes.  He's this dude you can walk right up to before killing any bosses after the Asylum if you took the Master Key, and he one-shots most players for most of the game.  His armor offers the highest poise and nearly-highest of most other stats, but weighs too much to properly roll in without dumping endless stats into Endurance, so he's just a beast overall.

And he's just...standing there.  Like a casual npc enemy.  No fog wall or anything.  Otherwise, in the lore he's a legendary dragonslayer."

gaming,"Well you are getting the game for Free, and most of microtransactions are for cosmetic upgrades which don't change much."

Right. Yes. It was the rage of no Diablo 4 announcement that did it. Yep. 

I would bet if you looked at EAs stock it would look the same. As would Apple's.



Edit: heres the data. Copied from another comment. 


I invite you to actually look at the data and educate yourself instead of claiming something is ass pulled.

And just for fun. Heres EA

Sorry guys. Gamer rage means fuck all until the masses get on board with it as well. 

I invite you to take a look at EA from when battlefront 2 was released. It didnt phase them in the slightest. They actually hit their all time peak ***AFTER*** the ""fiasco"" of battlefront 2. 

Sorry to be the dose of reality guys.

I wish EA and Activision weren't so shitty as well. But when you look at the data there is no other conclusion to make. These companies are absolutely killing it despite us not liking their business practices. This drop in their stock prices has very little to do with the backlash about phones and far more to do with macro economics."

gaming,Thirst trap for upvotes no doubt.
gaming,"actually, it kind of is. of course it's much more complicated than that, but stock price is basically dependent on shareholder's trust in profitability of the company, which is naturally heavily dependent on *actual* profitability of the company, but also very much on *expected* profitability, which is very much dependent on how people (customers, other companies, etc) react to what the company is doing.


it's about 20% reality, 30% rumors and people behavior, 50% feedback loops and corrections caused by the first two."
gaming,Is this a joke?
gaming,"Wasn't right from the start, though."
gaming,"I had no idea Sean Bean played Martin. Makes sense that Martin ""dies"" as the end."
gaming,"Their tracking is really slow, just sprint and jump when you see the laser on you. No movement items necessary."
gaming,"Thought dumb logic might help you.  Lol sorry, personally I’m not a rocket league guy anyways and isnt the game going downhill?"
gaming,"I’m pretty sure you will be able to play on Steam if you already own it. Also, Epic has not confirmed that it was be exclusive for the Epic Store (it probably will knowing Epic), so far they have only bought Psyonix."
gaming,I had this. Used to stay up all night wondering how that mans head could fit inside the truck.
gaming,Haha yeah I didn’t even think about that
gaming,Why would they keep it on steam if they are now signed with epic?

gaming,WTF i literally hate psyonix and subsequently rocket league now.
gaming,They wouldn’t make any money off of people like me. I’m the type of person who chooses the default when creating characters. I couldn’t care less what my character looks like.
gaming,"You can still play them offline I guess, and also a lot of games have DLC and a normal fee, so they are taking your money twice, which can be counted as an in app purchase."
gaming,I believe it will be taken off Steam once or soon after the switch the Epic is made.
gaming,"Hokay so like half a century ago, humans discovered that they could make computers talk to each other. They massively overdeveloped this technology until a vast network called ""The Internet"" covered the entire globe. This has made a lot of people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.

Anyway, I digress. So people realised that they could use the Internet as a vast storage of thoughts and ideas, to better humanity.

...But then they realised that they could use it to look at boobies whenever they want. Everyone had a vote, and boobies won.

So anyway, people need efficient ways of looking at boobies, and one way of doing that is to have them all in one place on the internet at the same time. Thus, /r/GoneWild was born.

As /r/GoneWild gained traction, and began to develop critically acclaimed spinoffs like /r/GoneMild, and /r/MarmiteBadgerGoneWild, people began to realise that they could use their boobies database for other things, like pictures of what we call ""Cosplays"", which are in fact just clever ways to pretend you want someone to see a cool costume, when it turns out it's just boobies anyway.

Thus, /r/Gaming was born.

Anyway, to answer your question, I have no fucking idea what's going on. Something about super heroes? idk."

gaming,"""Just like the simulations"""
gaming,"This has a lot more to do with Blizzard not having as good of a long term plan anymore, especially with the underperformance of Overwatch and BFA.

Correlation does not imply causation is an elementary concept. Gamers didn't suddenly cancel their wow subs right then and there and lead to a decline in stocks.

Blizzard underperformed at their own event and shareholders lost confidence. This isn't a matter of voting with wallets where the votes were cast and tallied in a single day.

That's not to say Diablo Immortal has nothing to do with it, as the backlash definitely contributed to shareholders losing confidence in Blizzard."
gaming,I upvoted this simply because I want to put a ding in what you're doing.
gaming,"Imagine if you required a third party app on your console, which you were forced to use to purchase the game you want to play. This app also needs to run in the background if you want your games to stay up to date, slowing down your console as a result. Then You need to make a new account in order to buy the game you want with questionable security and support in the event you get hacked. The app does not have local currencies so you must buy in a foreign currency. The app doesn't support cloud saves for your games, the app doesn't let you play your game if your internet dies, there are no user reviews for the games on the store.

That would suck for console gamers right?! As this is pretty much the same problem pc gamers are facing now. Basically strong arming players with fewer features it's not cool man.

Or imagine you preorder the next biggest title you are really looking forward to, they then cancel your preorder and tell you well it's not coming out on your platform anymore, it's going to a different console."
gaming,"exactly. all the people that don't make, but very much enable those choices, and suffer in their atrocious jobs, should lose their jobs so they can go find or create better ones, possibly ones where they will be able to make choices, hopefully much better ones."
gaming,It's a damn fine way to spend an afternoon and/or evening.
gaming,honestly its kind of looking like a spite acquisition since rocket league still has decent player numbers on steam.  they'll probably make it free2play on epic like it is on ps4
gaming,"I played another game with this feature, bu| I can't remember which is was? One of the earlier Rainbow Six, maybe?"
gaming,"And the movie beige is way too white imo. It typically looks like a Caucasian skin tone color, but this movie makes it snow white in most light. Just feels off.

gaming,Your choice of name kinda gives away the surprise doesn't it?
gaming,Replace Ludicolo with the goomba from super Mario bros
gaming,Is that a FNAF Chica reference?
gaming,No. Game companies shouldn't give their game out for free. They won't make any money. Some people might spend the 5 dollars to get that extra shiny skin they want but not everyone. So automatically they are losing money. They should just increase the cost of games and give us everything right at the beginning instead of locking half the game until you buy it. It's a waste of time and money
gaming,"It wouldn't have been too much to alter his proportions and make it match what he looked like in game. His head is just weird, he looks like a half cabbage patch munchkin with with blue fur."

gaming,"Not sure if they are still doing this, but NWI did offer a 10% discount to anybody who owned the original Insurgency.

gaming,Where are you getting these figures?
gaming,Lol yeah the only tier that I didn’t complete was the first one before they changed the amount of time to tier up. It’s not as bad as people make it out to be.
gaming,"Nope. The sad thing is that once your character design is finalized they ""rig"" the character (kind of like putting strings on a puppet), for the purpose of doing all the animations.

If they change the design in any major way (such as fixing his stupid legs or horrible eyes) the rigging has to be adjusted, meaning that every bit of animation would have to done again to accommodate the new ""strings"". Otherwise it would just bend the character out of proportion in every scene.

This film is screwed."
gaming,Interesting feature but its entirely unrealistic. If anything it would do the opposite and jam the door.
gaming,he makes a good point
gaming,"no thats no wrong

I can post on their Twitter/FB, email them, or call them to voice the reason why they will not recive any money from me for BL3. If BL4 ends up being a thing and they dont sellout for easy money to a company with bad business pratices I will happily buy it. I love the franchise and would like to play 3 but I have had enough with the AAA market and refuse to keep feeding bad busniess pratices that harm consumers for profit. Plenty of Indy devs out there makeing great games."

gaming,"No idea, unfortunately it was the only version I could find."

gaming,"This is the red encounter, either Gen2 or the remakes, not in Gen 3."
gaming,"&gt; but it’s gameplay is exactly like the other 3 

Thats just an incorrect statement completely.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, overall the game is similar to the other 3, but what exactly is wrong with that?  All the Halo games play similarly, all the Gears of war games play similarly, Most Final Fantasy games play similarly.  

&amp;#x200B;

If a system aint broke, dont fix it.  There are multiple new mechanics to explore with this new game, Mantleing and sliding have been added in to make movement better, Each character now has multiple action skills you can swap out and combine with different modifiers, so that even if 4 people are playing the same character none of them will be playing the same way.  All the manufactures have bigger and better gimmicks with their guns, Tediore not only explodes, but can also turn into mobile and immobile turrets, Torgue weapons launch Sticky bombs or rockets,  Vladof weapons have under barrel attachments for you to use, Dahl can switch fire rate, Maliwan can change elements  etc.

&amp;#x200B;

A new game in a series does not need to be a drastic departure from the past games.  If the past game was loved (Borderlands 2 was very very loved) then its better to simply improve upon it and add new things rather than tear it down and rebuild something else."
gaming,"But you get actual content when pay for DLC, not just a cosmetic."
gaming,Yep. Exactly. I'm not arguing that. It is 100% on me and my principles.

gaming,You may laugh now...but perhaps one day this will become a reality.
gaming,I didn't know people were making text post adaptations of I Hate Everything videos.
gaming,Because people on this sub regularly exaggerate about negative things regarding the EGS to try and prove a point.
gaming,*Ride on the sankey school bus*
gaming,If they want to save this movie they need to delay it's release and seriously redo sonic like asap. Sure it's millions in CGI and editing but seriously releasing it as is will ruin it.
gaming,"“They say ignorance is bliss. Tell me, is that true?”"
gaming,Right so many replays.
gaming,"&gt; Fuck that new sonic

I don't even think the worst Sonic fans would go that low..."
gaming,I'm starting to see these memes everywhere.  Is this literally how Tails looks in the movie?
gaming,"Hmmm. That’s interesting. I prefer the Xbox controller as well, but since I’m mainly a pc gamer the choice between consoles was a no-brainer considering all Microsoft exclusives are on PC as well as Xbox. I’m just a huge fan of the exclusives on PS4, but I definitely prefer the interface of Xbox/Microsoft."
gaming,"I am happy for you, internet stranger."
gaming,Credit ADELE MORSE you fat thieving bastards
gaming,"Article has been updated. Author commented:

&gt;We’ve updated the article with information that the game will be supported for Steam purchases but not available for sale once it’s up on EGS [later this year]."
gaming,Booooyy lets pay kotaku to churn out positive blizzard articles 🐠🐠🐠🐠🐟🐬🐬🐋🐋🐳🐳🐳
gaming,You telling me this is OC? I upvote OC.
gaming,"It depends on how you look at it. Different translations of the games and comics and TV shows used different names (and different lore entirely). In the version of the lore with Kintorbor, the name ""Eggman"" didn't exist so I feel like it'd be more accurate to say it was pre-Robotnik (Kintobor is actually Robotnik backwards), but in the end we've accepted ""Eggman"" as the canonical name so, I mean... Look it's all a mess, just use what you want."
gaming,The game I never knew I needed
gaming,Who doesn't love/fear of Katie.
gaming,I wouldn't make my worst enemy sit on that unholy contraption.
gaming,Somebody gave plat for this? lol
gaming,Ok(eory for had englinsg)
gaming,Is it really cheap though? I would think due to foot traffic it would be fairly high. I cannot find anything online on how much it costs.
gaming,They're taking it off Steam eventually. Unfortunately. I know the game uses it's own system for friends and such but this is disgusting.
gaming,"Vectors? I’ve got tons of experience with that! I used to make generative art with JavaScript for fun. That sweetens the deal then, I’m going to develop a game of my own! Thanks a lot for the insights. I’ll be sure to try out your game when I have some time on my hands! (Post saved)"
gaming,/r/gaming is honestly the most predictable sub.
gaming,"D just because my phone is always around me and I have some ""check this once in a while"" type games. Otherwise, A."
gaming,But it is an inferior platform that has security issues and a worse is all around a lesser product that is only competitive because they throw money at publishers to make their games exclusive on that platform
gaming,"I can think of a few things, but the primary one that comes to mind isn't terribly appropriate."
gaming,"If you want paint but better, try [paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) aka ""bootleg GIMP"". You might be asking, isn't GIMP free? Yes. But I don't like how it looks so use this instead."

gaming,"No I believe its ""chaos control."""
gaming,"Imagine if detective Pikachu was detective Mr. Mime, people will have the same reaction to the movie. Whoever make the design directions for CGI sonic needs to rethink their life choices."

gaming,"Look at the OP's account name

I suggest upvote to ruin it

LMAO"
gaming,"In all honesty, how many people were that interested in a Sonic movie that they created it?"
gaming,"Not really OC imo. The idea is original, but the pics and comic are not.
I cropped and edited the pics, text and comic.
More like an over the top glorified and *original* exploitable."
gaming,It's those fuckin teeth
gaming,It’s more to do with their lack of an upcoming answer to Fortnite.
gaming,"calling it now , knuckles will have dreadlocks"
gaming,That's where your wrong. This movie was made for to snatch that furry market. Nothing else makes sense.
gaming,It will be out this month on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1012560/Snakeybus/).
gaming,"The dust brown environments make it look samey to all the other games we've been getting. So it kinda fell through as some generic game. 

Heck, I heard it was good and yet it still remains fairly low in my next-to-play pile."
gaming,You beat me to it.
gaming,"I did love Arkham Knight! The only thing I got bored of was the Batmobile, destroy robot tanks sections. The one mission where you have to sneak past the big tanks and shoot their tiny weak spot, irritated the hell out of me."
gaming,"Steam should just pull the game off the store right now, any sale will just give extra profit to Epic. I doubt epic has any infrastructure set up yet for the game and it's not for sale on their store yet. They'd have to scramble to make the game available again and probably do it half arsed :)"
gaming,"For me it’s his eyes, his human teeth and his white hands instead of just having gloves"

Thanks for the websites and info. That's what I was looking for."
gaming,"If it's good, I dont care if the taliban is selling it I'm buying it."
gaming,Why should they quit just because new customers will need to buy the game on EGS?
gaming,"NOOOO not Tails too, it's so horrific!"
gaming,Done before? Yes. Do you get downvoted? Also yes
gaming,Not to mention it is a full on supported e-sport already. Fan base preinstalled.
gaming,Ruin this users name by upvoting
gaming,"You are very defensive when it comes to this game, to the point of insulting people that wont buy it. Are you a dev or someone involved with makeing this game? Thats the only thing I can think of that makes sence on why you would attack people for voicing there distaste on how the game is being handled."
gaming,I’m excited for both
gaming,The graphic style of The Forest is the polar opposite of what I am looking for...
gaming,"Go eat a sandwich, kid."
gaming,"Am I the only one who was bugged by the fact that Sonic can move so fast that missiles seem to be standing still, yet he somehow can't dodge a tranquilizer dart?

I mean, on top of how terrible the movie already looks."
gaming,Learn to spell and I'll like you a whole lot more.
gaming,Is that Crack Fox from The Mighty Boosh?
gaming,Looks like it's coming out on steam this month
gaming,That stampede and Be Prepared were probably the most difficult stages in the game.
gaming,STALKER and Metro: Exodus
gaming,"But at least you don’t have to shell out a couple hundred bucks to get it, that’s all I’m saying. It’s very different to console exclusivity in that way"
gaming,"Oh yeah, my mistake."
gaming,"If they made him look like sonic instead of a human/badger crossbreed going through its alternative phase, I could get behind it."
gaming,"My sense of humor rates your comment 10/10.

Nope.  Chuck Testa."

gaming,"This Sonic definitely weirds me out a bit, but I will support and stay optimistic about this movie because Benny Schwa is da best."
gaming,"I think there's less. There's a gallery when I type in 34: cgi hedgehog. 

Also seems to reference some sort of rule that I don't understand."
gaming,"I think people are mostly excited to see new features and maybe a bit on how the classes play.  Stuff like being able to knock the explosive barrels around, some of the new gun mods, ect."

gaming,I read it in the voice of the maggot fox :(
gaming,"he's a a caricature of an animal (exagurated feautres) that they tried to turn ""realistic"""
gaming,"Pikachu would look like hell too if they had put a weird pseudo-human face on him. They stuck to the source material, that's why it worked. It's not about it being realistic.. sonic would look like shit if you *drew* him like this. They didn't stick to the source material and they made something uglier that wouldn't work in any medium. There is something to be said about him falling into uncanny valley, though. They should have gone roger rabbit and just used animation or cartoonish CGI that keeps his original proportions."
gaming,I can't wait for this sub to stop spamming posts on this.

gaming,This just looks super underwhelming
gaming,"Oooo.... You must have missed the ""Do I care?"" part of the title.  Better luck next time."
gaming,"You won't be able to buy the Steam version after the Epic one comes out.  If you have a Steam version before it release on Epic you will still be able to play it through Steam.  It's a lot like with how they handled Exodus, except after release and a lot more heads up."

gaming,I wonder if they could at least give him hedgehog teeth instead of human teeth....
gaming,"⬆️🚫SCAM WARNING🚫⬆   

**This applies to mugs/posters/etc...**

This listing was created today, almost certainly in response to this post. There are lots of people who trawl reddit for popular posts of graphics and funny shirts. They upload low resolution images found on google or even cut and pasted from the reddit post’s photo, onto garment preview images.  

The broken English nonsense description is also a red flag (even though it’s inadvertantly hilarious). When you buy the shirt, if you actually receive it you will very likely receive a shit quality shirt with a fuzzy blurry print. 

Be careful, friends!"

gaming,Knuckles has been found dead in Miami
gaming,That’s what OC is now.
gaming,For both black magic and the occult you could always try Secret World Legends. The whole game is based around you waking up having a new power awoken within you and you get contacted by a secret society. (3 different factions and you get to choose which you prefer.) They all have very different stories but the overall game story is pretty much the same regardless of which you choose.
gaming,Is it bad my first reaction is to be somewhat disappointed
gaming,Right. But kids aren't people (lolz) thats why they sell so well and companies make billions.
gaming,"It's the remakes, HG/SS. Honestly the best of any Pokemon game, bar none. Enough Pokemon to make catching them all a challenge, but not too many to make it just about impossible. It's also the only game with a strong post-E4 segment. High level gyms are great and I don't know why they didn't bring this feature back."
gaming,"If that's the case, you need to get your priorities straight and get out more."
gaming,That's fair but I'm honestly telling the truth at this point. It's why I've stopped playing fortnite primarily because I can't play when I want to and have to hope that I get my second authentication code in time to be able to play.
gaming,Heaven is a void Sonic
gaming,wait is that ACTUALLY Tails teasing for a second movie ? I honestly thought it was a joke someone made with a weird looking fox
gaming,Weren't the laptops they released pretty highly reviewed given the specs/price?
gaming,This looks better then any AAA game at the moment.
gaming,"I know its the remakes, I'm just telling him that the Red encounter won't happen in the games he's playing."
gaming,"Actually f2p is mostly about the boiling the frog. This as nothing to do with dev and is all about marketing. IMO, marketers are basically graduated customer fucker, therefore they will exploit every human weakness (gambling, laziness, pride, etc.). I think this is bad when targeting grown ups and even worst when focusing children."
gaming,"Yeah they really, really haven't stuck to any kind of consistent lore with Sonic. I mean, most video games from that era that still exist don't really stick to their lore anymore, but Sonic takes it to another level. While Mario and Pokemon have just changed a bit over the years, Sonic seems to be a completely different universe every single time we see him."
gaming,If you own the game will you get your money back or will you just lose the game or what?

gaming,"Actually, you see that big E on your chart? That's called an earnings release. This is reporting financials for a quarter that usually ended a month ago or so (in their case probably the end of September). 

So, no, it has nothing to do with Diablo on phones, which will actually probably do quite well. Activision/Blizzard, who also owns King, knows quite alot about the economics of mobile gaming."
gaming,"They already committed to spending more than the GDP of Guatemala on this movie, you'd think they could commit the resources to fixing the model and animations even if it means going over budget and even if it would be difficult."
gaming,Acquiring companies/properties and making them exclusive to your storefront when they previously weren't just to hurt competitors and split up the community.

gaming,Dunno but I feel the same.
gaming,Please tell me this isn't from the DLC
gaming,"So, after spending a good 8 hours so far getting the hang of things- I absolutely agree with you.  It just wouldn’t be the same.   I’m having a blast with this game tho lol"

gaming,"tfw someone calls a controller a ""remote"" :|"
gaming,"Aa far as life action motherfucking Sonic movies go, the trailer looked pretty alright.

Like how the hell would you make a real movie out of Sonic?

Yeah, they could have just not done it. But hell, now it exists and a lot of kids will enjoy it. Hell, I'm a 31 yo hardcore gamer and I think it might entertain me.

Think it looks stupid? Don't watch it, shut up and move on. 

Can we stop this circle jerk now please?"
gaming,And the eyes. Fucking creepy serial killer eyes. There's a reason animie characters have eyes that take up 3/5ths of their face.
gaming,These are perfect.  Thank you.                                  Is the hard reset extended any good?

gaming,"""Who let the kid into the drug den this time?"""
gaming,The principle is the same. Would you download anything that sells your information to china? Would you download a program that upon launch scans your steam api and sends it to hq? This isnt about money. This issue isnt about money. Its about shitty practices in the industry. I dont use the store on principle because of how shitty it is. On the other hand if they had a better platform that was on its own competitive and not just a padlock hiding software and wouldnt be basically spyware I wouldnt mind using it.

Poor Tails will be in the alleys sucking dick for a gram of meth in no time."
gaming,I’m amazed at how much Epic wants us to not like them. Just one screw you after another.
gaming,Is it bad my first reaction is to be somewhat disappointed

gaming,I REALLY hate the design of sonic in this movie. I don't really even understand why they did it. It would've been fine if they just took the design of sonic from the games and just me him look furry and have quills and shit. There are so many strange design choices and terrible lines in just the trailer alone. I'm not even a Sonic fan and I'm pissed off.

My issue isn't with the study but how you framed it. It CAN lead to benefits if eaten in moderation but a typically healthy adult. Don't give people the wrong idea."

gaming,"Sony, and Nintendo are dicks, if you would like me to rephrase. I wanna play certain studio's games. However, their attempts at monopolistic ideals are stopping millions of people from enjoying their games and that's kinda sad. Also there's no emulator for PS4 or Switch yet. Why I'm semi-okay with Microsoft for at least porting a fair share of their games over to PC, regardless of the fact that it's on a different marketplace. Though their recent efforts in porting The Master Chief Collection over to PC via Steam."

gaming,I'm going to miss memes like this when they're banned in the EU.
gaming,"It was made worse by the Japanese and Western releases having wildly different stories made up for the early games, and both of them throwing them away when the Dreamcast came along. Then there's the Archie comics, which I think still have the same continuity to this day, and there's Sonic SatAM which is loosely based on the Archie comics, and then there was a UK Sonic Comic for a few years... it adds up to a maelstrom. And... and oh god there's Sonic Underground as well. That blade of chaos to insert into the nightmare cake of sonic canon.

Which also then creates the worst fan problem: What is Sonic is different for different people. For some people he's a hedgehog that runs fast and collects rings. For others he's a rebel fighting against a tyrant to rebuild his home. For others he's a hedgehog from another dimension lost on Earth. For others he's a rock and roll player. For a few poor twisted souls he is a werehog. 

It makes every story one which is going to disappoint some fans. Although not being terrible would be a good start."
gaming,Surprisingly my two favorite FPSs as well.

gaming,"Fortnite is really only competing with Overwatch, and even then it's kind of a stretch to say that since both games follow very different philosiphies, Apex is the Battle Royal that likely steps on the toes of Fortnite.

A/B's issues stem from a lot of things.  Destiny 2 flopped so hard that the third installment was canceled and Bungie let go from the Activision umbrella, meaning the lost out on what should have been one of their major cash cows for years to come.  Battle For Azeroth, WoW's newest expansion, has been hemorrhaging players to which Blizzard is expecting a lot less income from what is usually a large money maker for them.  Meanwhile while their games as a service products are in a decline, both Activision and Blizzard have almost nothing new really planned to help strum up new interest.

As of such, A/B is expecting *big* losses next year.  Its why the restructured a while back in an effort to hire more devs to actually make more games.  They went in deep towards the games as a service model and it's coming back to bite them."
gaming,"I agree, there is no clear best practices. However there are terrible ones."
gaming,"Best part about skyrim was the inns and taverns. Peaceful, yet busy, with mods taverns feel so alive, NPCs talk to each other instead of all staring at you. At night, the taverns are FILLED with NPCs, from house wives to guards. Music is played in groups, you can hear laughing and singing, people dance around with joy. 

That's my peaceful moment."
gaming,"We also like horizon  god of war and pre cata wow 

Right guys ?"
gaming,"There have been a TON of fanmade versions that all look just fine, paramount just outright shit the bed with this one. Made even worse by the fact that they could EASILY go back and fix this before release for a relatively small cost, but they ain't gonna."

Tails: I'M FUCKIN DYING, MAN!"
gaming,"EA declined more gradually, and has recovered much more from its low point than Activision. Apple has already recovered most of the losses that it took since October, but its also not a gaming company, so it's not a 1 to 1 comparison. The DOW, NSADAQ, and S&amp;P have all either recovered or are very close to it. 

Activision may have dropped with the rest of the market, but they haven't recovered with it."

gaming,Yea Teaser shit is done first in a promo format. The problem is animation studio won't get more money to re do it so they will just force each person to work 20 more hours a week if they were going to change it.

gaming,"And that's fair. But what have Activision released? Nothing really. They've stagnated one quarter. It's far from the end for them.

If the trend continues for another year or longer then they could be in trouble.


Edit: the point of showing apple was that it wasnt a 1 to 1 comparison. It's one of the most wildly successful companies in the world and it was still hit.  As you point out, correctly, it was also easier for them to recover.  But that really isnt all that suprising."

gaming,"This was a great game! It came out during Squaresoft's golden era. By my reckoning, that's late SNES period (FF6, Chrono Trigger) through middle PSX period (this game, Einhander, Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross, etc.)

The teams they had on hand during this time produced a heck of a lot of good games. I don't think many of them are still around."

gaming,"looking at their 1Y and 5Y chart, they seem to have been on a steady rise with noticeable corrections happening roughly at that time (november), which i assume is because of the yearly announcements, but this dip was significantly larger, basically erased all their growth from the past 2 years, and is already taking about twice longer than the second largest, which was in nov/dec 2016 up to end of jan/feb 2017.


so to my layman eye, it definitely looks like something ""a bit"" out of the ordinary cycle for the past few years."

gaming,So badly want to play the football and shooting one!
gaming,"The problem is that Blizzard is a PC-gaming company, and they managed to piss off their PC players.   That's not a case of ""only effecting 2% of the companies revenue.""   If you're an investor, and you see a company piss off and alienate a huge portion of their customers, it's going to effect your confidence in the future of that company -- and that's going to be reflected in the stock price.

And yes, the markets dropped about 11% in the months after this announcement took place, and then they immediately bounced back.

The issue is that the Activision/Blizzard stock dropped almost 3x more than the market (~33%), and unlike the market, the stock price never recovered.

But all of that aside, my main point was that ""Yes, that's how stocks work.""

There's always a ton of factors that go into deciding how people currently value a company's stocks, and one of those big factors is how happy their customers are.  If the customers revolt, that's going to fundamentally alter the price of the stock -- as we're seeing today with Activision/Blizzard."

76 is junk compared to them.

Imagine if someone played Fallout 4, completed every quest in the entire game, killed every *human* NPC that exists, then got rid of their possessions and dropped a save...

Then you pick up that save, on a new map, and with a janky multiplayer system. Oh and that guy left you a string of holotapes to go find.

And that's Fallout 76.

I'll guarantee you most of that fall and the beginning of the down trend happened an hour or two after earnings released, as usual. Probably bad guidance or missed estimates.

What I like most about the game is that you can make your own race via in game options or mods. You pick the government style, your ruler, and even pick what traits your race as a whole has come to gain. 

The game has a lot of options for the type of world your race can live on too, like you can make it where your race lives on crystal worlds or graveyard worlds, tidally Locked worlds as well. 

The game offers all sorts of challenges to overcome such as diplomatic relations, home world issues with your citizens, economy, disease, robotic or citizen revolts, and even crime can take over a world if left unmanaged. Your citizens can go unemployed from over population as well.

Basically you are the ruler of an entire race and you can do whatever you want to modify them to your liking. 

I probably didn’t mention everything to bring this game justice but please give it a look, you don’t even need any of the DLCs to play this game none stop. The DLCs are cool in their own way but not needed.

Yet, focus groups are terrible for making decisions. Nearly every time they rely on them the result is something garbage and they never learn."
gaming,"Excuse me wtf, that looks fun af"
gaming,"No, this is terribly unfair to SMB.  It was 1993, the franchise was for children and younger teens, the people greenlighting the project likely barely played video games, if ever, and were also unlikely to realistically have any affinity or familiarity with the material.

Sonic, on the other hand, was made during a time where access to quality CGI is commonplace, a time where finding an art designer familiar with the original material should have been easy.  The people funding this project would have to have known that Sonic hasn't really been a hot ticket in many many years, so their target audience would be *parents* who fondly remember the game and would be willing to take their children.  They release a trailer that contains dated humor, garbage effects, and an absolutely bizarre artistic vision of the main character."
gaming,He did not know the way.
gaming,"I mean, she has a nice body and is showing it off at her own will. Cool with me."
gaming,Have you tried no man's sky? Quite colorful and now after all the updates it's a really fun and stimulating game. The game has so much color every where you go and I find I never get bored in it. Im just over 24 hours and just unlocked some land vehicles too. So lots of content
gaming,But if he's on the bottom the picture of Sonic will be covering him.. it's much better this way round
gaming,What was the cost?

gaming,This. Its like they forgot who they sell games to
gaming,"So glad to find somebody who agrees with this. I feel the same way about most modern cartoons as well. Even the legendary ones look super generic to me, as if a computer generator just kind of spit it out. The original 150 and some of the Gold/Silver generation felt so much more original."

gaming,I dont know if you're into it But Civilization 5 and 6 are pretty fun strategy games. You basically build an empire and compete against other countries. I tend to go for world domination and nuke everyone
gaming,"Wooo hooo you got me, Randy Pitchford here kicking up dust /s

In all seriousness, it’s just because Borderlands 3 has been doing everything right up except the epic thing. 

Borderlands is a really good game and I haven’t been excited for a game like this since Halo 5. Seeing people boycott it for 6 months because of exclusivity Is fine and the right thing to do, but never playing a good game, even when it’s not exclusive to epic because it *was* exclusive to epic I feel is wrong."

gaming,People sat in a room and greenlit this. People sat in a room and decided Gangster's Paradise was the best fit for this trailer.
gaming,"I'm confident that both of these movies will do well. I don't think Sonic will do as well as Detective Pikachu financially, simply because *what the fuck is going to make more money than Pokémon in this day and age*, but I think they'll be close to eachother in terms of reviews."
gaming,Is that the crack fox?
gaming,"I honestly think this movie looks fun as hell. It's Sonic. It's supposed to be too weird to rightfully exist, and yet it does and will always exist. The character has always been awkward. It's always been for kids. It's never made much sense. This movie is going to be absolutely everything anybody could rightfully expect it to be."
gaming,They thought you were calling them out for being on mobile
gaming,Steam taking L's e everywhere
gaming,"That's funny. Also here, I'll fix your first ""your"" for you."
gaming,Wow was it easy to play blitzball for hours
gaming,"My point was that public perception/blunders can and do effect stock prices.

Saying otherwise, as that guy did, is just simply wrong.

And yes, there's a lot of other factors that can effect a stock too.  I haven't done any sort of deep diving on Activision/Blizzard's finances see if I can nail down all of the causes for the stock drop.  But again, I'm just saying that pissing off your customers *will* be a factor in a stocks price."
gaming,This specific comment thread is a trip back to 1st grade for me.
gaming,"Faulting epic or not. I can’t be expected to download a new game store every time a company gets fortnite money and decides they wanna make one. I already end up opening both origin and steam because I forget which store I own which game on. So epic can fuck right off. They can buy any games exclusivities they want, I won’t be playing them."

gaming,Ready player one was shit I’m upset it’s happened in my lifetime
gaming,Don't you just love corporate competition?
gaming,"It's because you relax, thinking, ""I almost got it the first time,"" and end up doing badly because you don't have the hyper-focus you had on your first run."
gaming,"I wonder why that is exactly, and if there is a better practical method for gauging public opinion on things like that. You'd think focus groups would be relatively useful, even if flawed. But like you said, it seems like they often are not."

Even now, I prefer platforms that are DRM free like GOG (which was started by CD Projeckt Red) and doesn't get bloated by this corporate bullshitery with exclusivity, required webapp launchers, terrible review/community structure, and batshit DRM requirements."

gaming,"I was a put off by the very things you mention previously. It is understandable for sure and that change isn't something we can control unfortunately.

For me this feeling diminished each time I moved my old box of PC game boxes (not collector's editions physical items) but actual CDs/DVDs and manuals from closet to closet in each new abode.

I also don't mind never having to go find a download for the newest patch of a game and install it manually and sometimes getting version mismatches with friends in LAN situations.

Also, my buddies are all PC gaming nerds like me and we have been using Steam Chat for over a decade often more than texting for a lot for basic coordinating.

The thing that still irks me a bit is to launch a game from Steam to launch a launcher to login there...ugh."

The stock itself was fairly steady going up and down and normally Blizzcon announcements cause the stocks to rise. 

If you look at this you can see were at the end of October begining of November where Blizzcon was the stock just drops.  Then continues to as news of the Esports department being dropped. Issues with Overwatch and Wow subs dropping and the new of Diablo Mobile and the backlash from the community."

gaming,"Whoa. How did I not know this?

I never played GoF1 during its days. I played GoF2 and loved it to bits on iOS. Briefly picked up GoF1 but stopped. Also played the DLC for 2. I switched to Android and wanted to play it on there. It was riddled with microtransactions and was impossible to progress in. I gave up. Wanted to switch to PC but all these years later and it's still not released on PC.

I became really pissed off at the company at the time due to the microtransactions . Wasn't aware of what was happening within Fishlabs or the take over. I just assumed the company decided it was time to urinate on their products with crappy business policies.

Now that I know this game was made by the devs who made GoF, I'm definitely going to buy it! Thanks!"

Here is something for you to consider, Diablo as a franchise had stronger revenues in the quarters following the comment, than before it.

Reddit was able to get me connected with a group of amazing guys and gals from across the country! I joined a now defunct Naruto themed RP sub, through that I made a few friends. Since then we have made joint efforts to reach out to others and I am now currently engaged in 5 differently themed RPs! We have transitioned off of Reddit and onto our own Discord servers but across all 5 RPs we have &gt; 20 dedicated players across 5 countries! If you can post 1-3 times a day your in! 

Additionally, try taking a look at Montecook Games Cypher System! It is the best RP system I have encountered yet, skins itself beautifully onto any theme you would like to play and fixes all of the Meta-Complications that most people find cumbersome about DnD. I am currently engaged in 2 different Naruto themed RP, a My Hero theme, a Lovecraft theme and a One Piece themed RP. 

Go looking! I’m sure you can find others who have the same tastes just like I did. Best part? I’ve made some real friends (even though I’ve never seen set foot in the same place as them.)"

gaming,This change only affects PCs
gaming,"I really hope this means we can still play it on Steam (even if we can't buy it or any DLCs), because otherwise us Linux users are thoroughly fucked. Epic's attitude towards Linux is basically that it has cooties. 

This is single-handedly the worst gaming news this year. Epic scares the shit out of me."

gaming,"Pazaak in Star Wars Kotor, simple 20 card game, you and someone else go to (drawing random cards that range from 1-10) the highest number you can without going over 20, whoever has the highest number wins the round, and you must win 3 rounds to win, there’s also special cards you can put down after putting down a generic card, they can be +(1-6) -(1-6) or +-(1-6, which you get to choose whether you add or subtract, there’s also another type of special card, I think they have a 3/6 2/4 and something else, basically if you have a generic 6 card or a generic 3 card and you play it, they will turn to minus


Also a couple other things:
You can “equip” 8 special cards, and four will be randomly selected to last the entire game
If you use all 9 card slots (fills one slot with every generic/special card) without going over twenty, you automatically win


It’s really fun and despite all the rules it’s very simple when you play, like Uno, very simple to play but with a lot of rules"

gaming,"Will I mean they did threaten to Valve that they will keep doing it until steam changes their ways.  And once that happens Epic may even start selling their games on steam. They said they would stop buying exclusives if valve change their ways and paid devs more.

 I support the cause. Honestly if it has to take another big company to screw another one to prove a point then Valve needs to get their head out of Gabiens ass."

That's you. 

There is nothing to be done. Companies don't owe you jack! Most of their money was made during the initial release. If you bought the game on Steam, then you can continue to play it on Steam. It isn't the end of the world."

Do you think that this is good for the gaming industry?"
gaming,"Big difference. You can't change ANYTHING about rocket league its physics, maps, hitboxes etc. because players have invested thousands of hours in it. It'd be like changing the physics of real life basketball."

gaming,"Ok, wait I’ve seen this post like 5 times"
gaming,Shout out to the Crack Fox and his Squishy Boots.
gaming,Yes. We will receive updates and all but might not be able to buy the game after
gaming,"You realize all it means is downloading a free games launcher to play it right? if you don't already own it of course. Y'all act like it's the end of the world with these exclusives on PC. I've been a console gamer for awhile and recently have switched to PC and yeah I don't like the idea of exclusives because I didn't want to go buy a whole another console for one game. So to me this is nothing cause just downloaded the launcher and that's it. And I'm sure all if not most of you have it on steam already and if not you have til later this year to buy it. And as it's stated in the article you can still play it, will still be supported and still receive new content so no loss"

gaming,Yeah I know Jesus Christ spare my eyes
gaming,It’s more inconvenient for the consumer just so game devs can make more money. If the devs are fine with that then I’m fine with not buying their games at all.

Now another company comes out and tries to make it competitive and thats bad? I hear the arguments regarding Tencent but doesnt Tencent also own discord which every subreddit basically has a sponsored Discord server. Havent played Fortnite since Season 2 BR but I loved the PvE game when it launched. I miss Paragon =(, but I just am not sensing why Epic is so hated. Days Gone just released as an exclusive on PS4. Absolutely no controversy."

gaming,"I really don't like piracy, but if this keeps going it will become a big thing again.

I mean... isn't piracy the only way consumers can fight these trends nowdays?
Basically noone on the consumer's side is ok with this. Yet we either tag along or don't get to play games we love. There was a time when gamers selected games based on how good they were and not based on how many microtransactions.

Anyone else who remembers walking into the store,buying the disc for 50 or something $ and enjoying the hell out of it with no worry?"

gaming,Why not just get a 4TB external hard drive ?
gaming,"As long as Dragon Quest continues to be amazing, I care not for these lesser games that I suck ass at.  I only buy things on sale anyways. Although I have deep regret for buying Anthem. Haven’t played that in about 2 months... waiting for dlc updates."

gaming,This is almost as bad as when EA bought BioWare and turned them to the corporate side!
gaming,"Lol, so more and more companies are giving the middle finger to their clients."
gaming,"They are already doing a soft version of that.  Games that use unreal have to give I believe 5% of every sale to epic.  This is in addition to any other revenue split shenanigans, so if they sell their game on steam, they'd get 65%, while steam gets 30% and epic gets 5%.  But if they sell on the epic store, they don't have to pay this split, so they get 88%, while epic gets 12%, same as games that don't use unreal.

So basically, contrary to their ""We have to change this unfair revenue split!  Be the bigger person steam!"" talk, they make the revenue split even worse for anyone who uses their engine and doesn't sell on their storefront."
gaming,***GAS GAS G A S***
gaming,"Well, i think that people of r/fondanthate wouldn't aprove"
gaming,"Paragon was a beautiful game with a lot going for it. Near the end of its run they had finally dialed in on a strong map design. It's a sad story, but not one the Epic Store would sell you."
gaming,I'm with this guy. What a life saver that beautiful thing was. As a frightened child up against probably the worst horror I'd seen up to that point the shotgun was a freaking Godsend.

gaming,"Playing Neptunia Rebirth 1. Great characters and story (I got into it because of the anime). Game play is fun, but dungeons can get repetitive as they get recycled as higher level dungeons as you progress."
gaming,The most interesting part of Ready Player One was the remote-access school system. That could improve a lot of lives.
gaming,"Can’t you say the same exact thing about SARPBC? Some people invested a ton of time into it (ofc not nearly as many as Rocket League). The game was out for like 6 years before Rocket League came along. 

Just so we’re clear, I don’t want a “Rocket League 2” and I don’t think there ever will be one. I just think many people often forget or aren’t even aware that Rocket League is a sequel game to SARPBC"
gaming,there is no principle. otherwise you would have cried about how anti consumer the game industry is for the past 10 years with the only choice to get most games being steam.
gaming,"Assassin's creed origin's.  This is such a massive, fantastic game.  I love it so far"
gaming,"of course! Personally I know the 1000$ price for the index is absolutely worth the cost. Even though it has the same resolution as the vive pro and there are some headsets such as the HP Reverb coming out soon that actually have a higher resolution, the Index has very impressive screen and a duel lense technology that will have it offer the best visual VR experience. also the 90/120/144 hz refresh rates are something no upcoming HMD has (rift s is 80hz). That said, the rift S is only 400$ and is coming out soon aswell with more accessable and available pre-orders. Keep in mind the index also has insanely high and immersive audio technology. Here is a few reviews of the Rift S. This one compares the Rift S to the index a bit, note what he says about the audio experience.

- https://uploadvr.com/rift-s-hardware-review/
""Two days before Rift S arrived at my house, I put on Valve Index and let the near-field speakers hover right outside the surface of my ears as I played Beat Saber. This effectively destroyed my first impressions of Beat Saber in Rift S. All I could do in Rift S was remember the things I heard in my Index demo that I couldn’t hear in Facebook’s new PC VR headset. And the Valve design still allowed me to hear things from two realities with the same level of off-ear comfort.""

- Also bear in mind the Rift S and oculus have some awesome AAA VR exclusives, read about the upcoming games here. https://uploadvr.com/upcoming-major-rift-s-exclusives/

Im personally considering pre-ordering a Rift S since the Valve index sold out in 20 minutes earlier, with the next wave of orders only coming in AUGUST :( … but I would sell it after the summer and still order the Index because im a huge enthusiast. 

If you are worried about the price and still need to upgrade your PC and don't feel like waiting so long, I strongly recommend the rift S. It of course has native support for oculus' exclusive games but will also work with every game on steam including boneworks and valves upcoming ""flagship"" VR game coming this year. 

up to you to decide what you wanna do. Rift S pre -orders wave 2 start may 27th I believe."

gaming,"My only beef with rocket League is the aerial stuff.

Like I get that it's a competitive game and thus has a super-high skill ceiling, and that's awesome. But, honestly, I'm just not going to spend 2,000 hours learning how to do aerial tricks in a car soccer video game.

So when I join a game, it's either people like me who don't do aerial stuff, in which case the game is fun. Or it's a game where the other team is doing crazy aerial shit, in which case I've already lost and I have to waste 3 minutes of my life waiting for the game to end.

I wish they had a mode without aerial boosts or something."

gaming,I've got that shooting sound on my phone's notifications 😁
gaming,I honestly would not be surprised if this was real.
gaming,I wasn’t happy with steam either. I’d prefer games be standalone like they were in the 90s and early 2000s on pc. But every game in existence jumped ship to steam willingly and now they wanna act like steam is bad and epic is good. Game companies make decent money even when their game does poorly and their skills are in high demand. I’m not going to keep being told where to shop by these people.

I decided to transfer all of my files from the 1TB hard drive over to the 4TB and use the 1TB as the additional storage for my Xbox. I think I'll be okay seeing that I have 1TB of internal Xbox storage which took a pretty decent amount of time to fill up and now another 1TB of storage on the external hard drive which will be for additional games and whatnot

gaming,Umbrella Corporation........... Wtf am I seeing
gaming,Pretty sure everyone on a gaming sub will agree
gaming,"I would be happy with multiple online platforms/stores if all games were available on all platforms (paying royalties to developers for cross-platform games). Kind of how in brick and mortar stores you could typically find most/all games. That way, it would be a situation where the best store would win and these platforms would be incentivized to create value (read: features) for customers and actually compete. In this case, competition doesn’t properly exist, given that there aren’t any switching opportunities or substitutes (e.g., if you want to play a given game, you need to do it on a given platform). Multiple platforms with game exclusivity doesn’t actually negate the perceived current monopoly, it just creates multiple monopolies (pushes the issue down the ladder to the game level).

It’s much what we’re seeing with streaming services and a reason why pirating has gone up since “competition” (read: exclusivity on shows or movies) to Netflix has risen. There are some decent commentary videos online on this topic. An interesting parallel was made with the movie theater industry and similar competition/monopoly issues which was “solved” by a court case making it so that movies weren’t exclusive to the theaters belonging to their production houses.

In essence, these companies are leveraging IP rights to create monopolies and thus eliminating straight competition and in turn lowering incentives to create value and offer added features and better services to consumers. IP rights weren’t created for this purpose, but rather to promote/incentivize innovation.

An interesting topic actually.

gaming,"Plus, continuing to play it on steam, means Epic pays the server costs for the game and doesn't get any of the active userbase on the epic store benefit."
gaming,"Yeh I honestly hey frustrated playing with my group because they are almost always better and have played and know strats, but it 100% beats not playing. Hard enough to find a group, so I use it to learn and get better and sometimes I win. It's nice cuz they also have team games where we all work together, so it's a good mix of winning, losing and working together. It humbles me lol"

gaming,"I don't know why you're arguing.  This is economics 101.  If consumer confidence in a company drops, their share prices will too.

&gt; Your mistake is thinking that internet hyperbolic outrage about an an announcement at Blizzcon about potentially releasing a new game = Activision/Blizzard pissed off their customers

You're making it sound like this just reddit screaming into the void, and that's clearly not true.  Blizzard had a room full of hardcore fans at that BlizzCon, and the announcement pissed off the entire room.  There's a reason that guy stood up and asked if this whole announcement was a joke.  That speaks to the core of Blizzard's profitability.   If they piss off that many customers all at once, and a bunch of negative articles start circulating, that's going to have some effect on their stock price.

&gt; Here is something for you to consider, Diablo as a franchise had stronger revenues in the quarters following the comment, than before it.

How is that relevant?   Diablo Immortal isn't released yet.  So if the franchise gets stronger without it, that just means that the current PC/console games are proving to be popular.  That has nothing to do with an unreleased mobile game.  Blizzard fans love Diablo, that part was never in question.  The backlash was largely due to the fact that they were expecting Diablo 4, not a crappy mobile port done entirely by a chinese company that's known for making grindy pay-to-win games.

&gt; how do you think Monsanto's stock price is doing? How about Nestle? BP? There are 3 companies that routinely have much MUCH greater pr blunders than this...

You're comparing enormous and diversified companies that are worth roughly 10x what the entire Activision/Blizzard company is worth, though.   And BP?  Their stock price collapsed over 50% after the Deepwater Horizon incident.   I don't think you want to cite that as an example of public blunders not effecting stock prices...

But seriously, dude.  I'm not sure why you're arguing with me.  Again, this is economics 101:  If companies do something to make investors think that they've alienated their customers, or committed some other kind of blunder, that's going to effect the stock price."
gaming,What does that even mean
gaming,"I think THIS sub would be the last one to disagree with you about games being art.

gaming,Why would anyone in the gaming subreddit disagree with this? I'm not saying it's a bad post but if you're going for controversy this is the wrong place I think
gaming,but will they stop Steam from running it? Not that I am actually interested in the game itself. I am just wondering if Epic keeps buying up exclusives will they force those games to only work on Epic launcher and not on Steam?

Are people really that desperate to remove themselves from reality that they're willing to go to these lengths just to simulate it in a digital world?
gaming,What if EA sold it?
gaming,I tell ya hwhut
gaming,It wasn’t eventually accepted. It was forced after the entire market went there. And if that happens again I think i’ll move to console gaming. A free market is a mutual agreement. And as the consumer I don’t agree to buy my games on epic so if they want my money they’ll have to be available elsewhere.

its funny when you think about it, Epic are now trying hard to be EA, probably hated as much as they are right now but hell even EA did not remove existing games from Steam when they created Origin (you can still buy BC2, ME2 etc)

Epic truly have gone from a company I could once admire (UT etc) to one I despise with a passion - really gonna inspire a resurgence in pirating games.

gaming,"I don’t think Steam will cut their percentage, main reason being because Steam has a ton more features than Epic (for now) so they can use that as leverage to justify taking a bigger cut than Epic. Honestly I don’t think Epic could possibly compete without these exclusive deals, Steam has basically been the exclusive store for digital PC games for over 10 years, so Epic has no other option than use these exclusive deals."

It feels so unrewarding when I want to play as a gunslinger and I need 10 bullets to kill each guy and they need 50 bullets to kill me. There is no way I can survive spending countless hours on this game with a controller. Mouse and keyboard is a must.

I rather play GTA 5 story again on PC than this mess."
gaming,Yeah... if they do that I am still ok with it. dev studios will bail on Unreal. Theres several solid alternatives to it on the market. Plus things like Unity offer a W A Y better deal then Unreal anyway.

gaming,"To be fair Chris Redfield looks like the default character in like 90% of games, hes about as generic as it gets.  I feel like calling that a knockoff is reaching a bit."
gaming,"Yeah that’s how I see it. Epic is a brand new digital store front, if they offer the same games as Steam does then no one is going to buy from them, exclusives are their only choice."
gaming,"There will be people that live in it of course, but there will also be people that use it as an additive quality to their life. Just like gaming addicts and non-addicts.

There's plenty of benefits to society if it gets used additively, like the ability to visit your family in another country or work anywhere for office based work."
gaming,I FRICKEN LOVED THIS GAME HOLY COW
gaming,"Everyone keeps quoting the chart that epic put out, concerning revenue splits, but last i heard that chart was not even accurate, especially if you make a certain number of sales."
gaming,"Competitive is when you offer an item or a service at a comparable or reduced price, or the same item with bonus items or services. 

Not removing an item from a different store so you can be the single place to buy. 

If Epic was truly being competitive I would be over thrilled. But as they are only buying out and pulling a games to their launcher and now removing games from their competitors I find it distasteful and disgusting. 

At this point I will not buy any game on epic until they change their business plan and actually fix and update their launcher."

gaming,"The thing is it has little to do with the % cut steam takes. Discord only takes 10% from the games they sell on their store (2% better than Epic store), yet you don't see millions of developers running to Discord begging for exclusivity.

This is completely down to the fact that Epic buy their way into the market by making all these exclusivity deals on top of the % cut. You could say, well why doesn't Steam offer exclusivity deals themselves? But then you realise games will just become bidding wars and I don't think that's something Valve want to participate in or encourage."

His clothes look very rough in this image as compared to the fancy suit he was wearing in the majority of the trailer. This uniform reminds me of Robotnik's old look from the comic books. When they actually did tell Robotnik's origin story and from what I recall it was pretty good. He was a political refugee from a kingdom where his obsession for science and robotics was banished and thusly entered the Sonic universe wearing a old worn out jumpsuit.

tl:dr Robotnik tricked King Achorn into trushing the mad scientist. Became his royal scientific council and used the animal people of Knothole in his robot experiments. In the comics Robotnik is pretty much the coldest most heartless person in the universe. 

I've still got a couple boxes of the old comics, maybe I will pull them out and take a look, the stories really got nutzo once they got into Knuckles."

They're not going through a publisher and are releasing it themselves through Steam.

They probably don't have any stock investors to keep happy.

They know that there is demand for games like this and that there will be enough people who gets it that they'll make more money than it's production cost."

gaming,"&gt; The principle is the same. Would you download anything that sells your information to china? Would you download a program that upon launch scans your steam api and sends it to hq?

On the other hand if they had a better platform that was on its own competitive and not just a padlock hiding software and wouldnt be basically spyware I wouldnt mind using it.

There is 0 evidence Epic has transferred or sold any data to any Chinese government, company, or entity."
gaming,Wow that's pretty neat.

gaming,1 of 20 checking in. Buy it! Totally worth more than $15. The DLCs that are included are worth that alone.
gaming,"It's not simply ""not buying a game"" I've been actively boycotting anything they put out despite interest including anything on their Origin store. I'm well aware of their similar tactics."
gaming,"I think my issue is they keep moving the goalposts.  Like, Star Citizen was supposed to only need something like 1/100th of what they are asking for now.  I understand increasing the scope after they ended up getting an absolutely massive budget increase, but it seems like they keep finding themselves in the need for even more money.  All that says to me is that they keep thinking ""Oh this feature would be cool we should throw this in!"" without thinking about how much that extra development is going to cost, leaving them to always ending up asking for more money and selling even more ridiculous micro-transactions to compensate.

Like I'm all for making a game the best it can be, but they need to figure out when to draw the line.  They need to decide when it's time to actually deliver on their promises, because while a lot of the stuff they are doing is impressive at the end of the day what they promised to deliver was a functional game, not a tech demo."
gaming,"Are you rarted. My issue isn't with fucking rocket league, it's Epic store and them buying out developers. Like 2k and borderlands 3 for example"

gaming,"Luckily... Tails, Knuckles and other characters from the Sonic universe have been spared from the atrocities of poorly rendered CGI. They aren't in the movie."

gaming,"Oh f*ck man, I was looking forward to get rocket league on steam for a 50% discount this summer sale. Guess I'm not getting it after all. Not because it being on EGS, but because I'm totally not gonna support this anti-consumerism bs epic is doing.

All the respect I had for Psyonix, lost in a moment..."
gaming,I spent about twice that amount and I have no regrets.
gaming,Exclusives to epic are not available on steam.
gaming,"yet you bought games there before battlefront when they were alreadying doing that, so clearly it's not a big concern to you."
gaming,This and the magic school bus dinosaurs pc game were my first pc games ever.  I miss this game lmao
gaming,"I second this, I used to play maple story like crazy back in the day"
gaming,"they are, a year down the line."
gaming,Unpopular opinion right here /s
gaming,"&gt; Epic: Buys exclusivity for fuckloads of popular titles either indefinitely or for a very long time, thinking it will make their new store popular

Specifically:

""Anno 1800 from Ubisoft, and Metro: Exodus from 4A Games, had the best PC launches in their respective franchise’s history. Congratulations to Metro: Exodus for leading the way as the top-grossing Epic Games store title."""
gaming,yeah just push through the early planets. once you get to the outer rim it's addictive.
gaming,Hello fellow freedom fighters.
gaming,"Just buy it and love it, you fuck!"
gaming,"I'd be interested to hear why the current state of Star Citizen doesn't bother you.

* The game was originally supposed to come out five years ago and still has no projected release date...except that *maybe* Squadron 42 will get a beta next year? Maybe? Maybe hopefully?
* Only a fraction of a percent of the promised scope of the game has been developed so far.
* The few playable or viewable demos that have been made available so far have been prone to serious bugs and crashes.
* The game's budget has already plowed through about $300 million with no cap in sight.
* Most of the game's budget comes from crowdfunding, a funding system where a good game being the result is the exception, not the rule.
* Another major revenue stream for the budget comes from selling digital spaceships for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. A huge chunk of the game's budget is used for marketing those spaceships.
* The cast of the game includes several A-list Hollywood actors. This isn't a problem in and of itself, but for a game that's already astronomically expensive, it shows that there's not a lot of restraint being employed budget-wise.
* The guy in charge of the operation hasn't been regularly involved in making good video games for around 20 years. In the meantime, his career has mostly consisted of making bad-to-mediocre movies and getting into weird legal entanglements.

I mean, I get what you're saying about the AAA industry, and I'm not saying that it doesn't do shitty things...but holy shit, it's going to take an absolute miracle for Star Citizen to NOT be the biggest failure in the history of video games."
gaming,"Buddy...i have put in about 120 hours in that game and only beat the main story and hearts of stone expansion...and maybe 40% of the last expansion.

This game is brilliant. So much content, narration, combat, quests and items to explore. 

Trust me, once you get into it and beat the game you’ll put it down with a heavy heart. You’ll actually get attached to the characters and the lore. There is just so MUCH. 

Trust me, this 15 dollars is what you would spend on a movie ticket...for maybe 3 hours of fun...this game? At least 60-100 hours depending on how fast or patient you will be. 

But my tip for you? Play the main story up until you are around level 25-30. Then interrupt your main story and proceed with the “hearts of stone DLC”.  Complete that, and return back to finish the main final missions.

And then retire peacefully with the last expansion pack...blood and wine. Beautiful scenery almost like a fairy tale. Here you can just have fun and cruise around."
gaming,"I’m doing this right the frack now!
[edit] done ‽"
gaming,That isn’t confirmed for all of them. Considering rocket league was there and is now leaving.
gaming,No idea but why would I say something negative about the picture and then upvote it?
gaming,"Just wait, some muppet will be along to loudly proclaim that this move will be perfect for everyone down the line due to the magic of competition."
gaming,"Halo CE shotgun.

Ain't nothing better when it comes to killing flood."
gaming,He looks so high that's theres no Word to express it
gaming,"Looks like a dude with long hair.



Damn."
gaming,"It's less about the exclusivity and more about the motivation behind it. Most of what Epic has done lately has been to actively disrupt Steam. Not compete. Disrupt.

I don't like exclusivity, but I've accepted it as an inevitable part of the gaming industry. I may not like having 5 different launchers for my games and I may not like missing out on that one cool game because it won't be released on PC or a console I have, but that's just the way it is. However, Epic has been throwing cash at a lot of developers to buy out that exclusivity, and not even permanently. They bought exclusive rights for the upcoming Borderlands 3 for *only the first 6 months*, after which it will probably go to Steam anyway. And now they've bought Psyonix so they could pull Rocket League from Steam *after it's already been there for 5 years.* 

There's no legitimately good reason for this. They're not keeping their own games in one place. They're not promoting a gaming platform (like console exclusives do). They're not even properly competing with Steam. They're saying ""you can play with my toys when I'm done"" and ""this is my toy now and you can't have it anymore"". This isn't a marketing strategy, it's childish behavior."
gaming,I'm glad it wasn't just me
gaming,I assume Total Annihilation. Great game :)
gaming,"Yes.

See: addictions, general."
gaming,It is common to call the controller a 'remote control' or 'remote' for short in India
gaming,Looks like a real crappy version of it but yeah I can see it possibly happening at some stage
gaming,"are you capable of reading? i clearly said that thats what is annoying about rocket league, as this is the first time they are actually just shifting consumer non-choice and not adding to it."
gaming,"Ah, a Cars reference. I see you are an individual of culture, as well."
gaming,Necropost but it's also the most innovative shooter I've played in years!
gaming,Omg it's Soo much more terrifying looking like the cartoon.
gaming,Could always try r/tabletopsimulator for starts. It’s not quite the same as playing in person but it’s a way of playing games with other people.
gaming,wow looking good :)
gaming,iits great but it would be better if it had a piece stickiing out the top to hold your butthole in place -\\\_(-.-)\_/-
gaming,This reads like a Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. I love it.
gaming,She'll get no work done hoeing like that
gaming,Its abit ominous to give you a dead console on valentine inst it?
gaming,Preorders for metro exodus on steam were upheld so people who own rocket league on steam will more than likely be able to continue playing rocket league on steam.
gaming,The one I never wanted to evolve
gaming,"What kind of a business decision is this? I'm scratching my brain trying to figure it out. It's, what, three years old at this point? Is the EGS expecting to really sell enough to warrant buying the company...? I might just be an ignoramus but this seems so short-sighted."
gaming,"I just play the random quick matches, i do wosh the match making for new players was better, sometimes I win a lot of times I lose, but im not going to be that upset for losing"
gaming,"that was just a standard ""we are new"" thing that they did to make people go over to them. It's like any promotional thing done by any company ever."
gaming,"Welcome to the arena! Two nerds enter, one nerd leaves."
gaming,"I am new to this, I came to know what happened about buying the game and stuff. But why do people hate Epic and what's exclusive store on epic? Can anyone tell me"
gaming,Might have actually watched it if he looked like that. At this point I have a complete lack of any desire to see that crap
gaming,"This is using a LOT of hindsight on a seriously shitty Mario Bros movie, and a LOT of foresight on a Sonic movie that hasn't even come out yet.

Really what it comes down to is a lot of 20-30+ year old guys shitting on a movie that is targeted kids. I'm sure if you show this Sonic movie to an 11-year old boy then he's going to love it. The piles of shit this trailer has received is absolutely moronic.

Also, that recent Woody the Woodpecker film had a $10M budget and no-name actors. The Sonic movie has a $90M budget and some talent behind it (Jim Carrey, James Marsden, Ben Schwartz, Junkie XL on the soundtrack, etc)."
gaming,"What’s our restrictions? Walkthrough it competitive??
Gen 1-4 or purely 4? In which case how do you factor in Weavile &amp; other evolutions of previous Gen?


Rosarade, Gastrodon , Rotom, Lucario, Garchomp, Bidoof

Rosarade is insane if built right."
gaming,"Autocorrect changes ""rarted"" to ""farted""."
gaming,"I'm so excited to hear this! The various unique mechanics (like the judgment wheel and the key of Solomon), the characters and settings... It's honestly my favorite RPG series. The third one goes a little off the rails, but still delivers a great experience. I actually bought a used copy of the first game on a whim when I went to pick up Orphan when it first came out. Didn't even finish Orphan. XD Koudelka is absurdly hard and totally different than the actual SH games, more like a horror survival game than an actual RPG. I truly hope you enjoy them if you can get your hand on them!"
gaming,"You can still read the reviews, just so you know"
gaming,"Well, I love you too, random stranger!"
gaming,"*How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?*"
gaming,I did read and was merely pointing out what you had previously said as an example of why your last comment isn’t comforting.
gaming,"Oof. Well, then he got killed by a peewee baby smh"
gaming,For 15 dollars that's a steal.
gaming,what is this ?
gaming,Technically any money now spent on buying it via Steam will go to Epic’s wallet anyway.
gaming,I’ve had Spirit Island sitting on a shelf for 6 months. I need to play it (solo unfortunately).
gaming,"Yes, it’s the best consumer protection that exists in a free market. Lack of competition is horrid."
gaming,I guess I have. They are the only place around here that thick cut choice grade steaks. Not even the steakhouse chains like Longhorns or Outback can compete with the steaks I can get at WalMart here.
gaming,"*And now, little man, I give the watch to you.*"
gaming,"Sure sure, whatever you say dude. You know me inside and out and all my priorities. Fuck off."
gaming,"Art that a board of directors gets to lord over, change, completely destroy if they so choose. An artist takes years to finish a piece? No problem. The video game developer takes years? That sucks because your art is being released 9 months early and unfinished for Christmas time."
gaming,"Gen 1 to Gen 4. My personal favourite is Blaziken, Tyranitar, Pidgeot, Gardivor, Flygon and Lanturn"
gaming,"These are just input / output devices. People are already capable of spending 5 minutes or 5 decades of their life in front of a screen.

gaming,"Lords mobile is a good example...only the ads are a special pack you can by every time you start the game...but wait you can also buy 11k hero's that cost 400$ just to unlock ,:-P"
gaming,"If you die in the game, you die in real life!"
gaming,"You clearly are not elderly enough to think this is a good idea.

Old people in charge of these decisions don't understand this whole ""E-Sports"" thing, and do it the wrong way, then say it's stupid and a fad when executions like the one shown above fail within the quarter.

The people who understand it are already established, and hosting events, LAN parties, and so forth."
gaming,"It doesn't mean consumers should happily allow a company to treat them like shit simply because the purpose of a business is to maximise profits. This is why consumers are pissed off, we need to reward pro-consumer behaviour and discourage anti-consumer behaviour."
gaming,"F Ready player one, give me SAO. Not a weeb, concept and execution just looked amazing."
gaming,"In less than 10 years, we'll have something very, very similar to The Oasis."
gaming,I like that it gives you rear view mirrors for some reason.
gaming,Jim is kinda saving the trailer...but naw.
gaming,"Let's be honest, when this stuff is a household thing, we'll all be sitting in our x-wings, or our pirate ships, or our virtual sex palaces... Still browsing Reddit."
gaming,Don't lose your head over it....
gaming,Its surprising how much better the eyes make it.
gaming,As opposed to Valve who only is in it for charity and doesn't want money?
gaming,No no we must go all the way. Voiced by Bill Cosby.
gaming,"There you go then, I think you have your answer. One of the old systems ran the way I said so I wrongly assumed."
gaming,"Thats because it's a reference to it, I applaud you /u/Marmite_Badger"
gaming,Detective Pikachu looks great! Also initial premiere screenings have been *extremely* positive.
gaming,wow looking good! ı want to play this
gaming,"It’s a shame wearing even the most headsets for more than a couple hours in a day can make totally healthy, non-epileptic people feel awful. Also that setup is expensive and certainly will never become widespread to already projected communities."
gaming,"Outside Rocket League, what's on Psyonix's portfolio?"
gaming,Why does one of the few early females in gaming have to wear a catsuit
gaming,"""but, but, Blizzard bad!"""
gaming,No game that has been removed from steam has been removed from users libraries to my knowledge
gaming,"&gt; New stuff will only launch on Epic Store. Users will (in theory) migrate to the Epic Store.
&gt; 
&gt; They haven't been able to get a user base outside of Fortnite by buying soon to launch exclusives. Now they're buying already popular games to try to drive adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Me, I'm just gonna save a few hundred dollars this year and pirate every game that I was going to purchase on Steam. Thanks Epic for saving me a bunch of money!

That's simply untrue.

gaming,"That looks more like a penguin, still great artwork though"
gaming,Click here to learn about the touching story of how Epic helped thousands of addicted gamers lose their vice!
gaming,Rocket League 2: Rocket Harder
gaming,i think like you
gaming,Didn’t borderlands 2 have this also?
gaming,"&gt; They are already doing a soft version of that. Games that use unreal have to give I believe 5% of every sale to epic. This is in addition to any other revenue split shenanigans, so if they sell their game on steam, they'd get 65%, while steam gets 30% and epic gets 5%. But if they sell on the epic store, they don't have to pay this split, so they get 88%, while epic gets 12%, same as games that don't use unreal.
&gt; 
&gt; So basically, contrary to their ""We have to change this unfair revenue split! Be the bigger person steam!"" talk, they make the revenue split even worse for anyone who uses their engine and doesn't sell on their storefront.

...So you expect them to give their engine away for free? 5% revenue is a great fucking deal for a complete engine which is well-tested, popular, and has a huge pool of experienced devs to draw upon.

Keep in mind: That's 5%.

For SIX TIMES THAT PRICE steam will... host your downloads and handle card transactions. Which literally a billion companies offer. lmao."
gaming,Wow if only I hadn’t seen this 10000 times on this sub today!!
gaming,Ai mayk moy own luck
gaming,Does that exclude the 5-10 million that Epic gave those publishers?
gaming,My ass rates it 5/10
gaming,"I sincerely thing it'll be a good movie. Whether it'll *do* well, that's another thing entirely, but it looks like it could be so bad it's good at the very least. And the little ones will probably enjoy this horrid abomination of a discount Quicksilver."

gaming,Is there a way to remote play your ps4 games too? I heard something about it but never looked into it much. The hacking/emulator is something I'll look into too if I get one. It would be nice to emulate on something with physical buttons.

gaming,I remember playing this when I was 6 or so and only ever ran around in the muumuu. Yet I remember it to this day.
gaming,Is this game going to be for VR as well? It looks like it would be amazingly immersive.
gaming,"They still have a long way to go before they can make that claim about AI, the AI right now is... well it's pretty bad.  It's slow and pretty dumb, which is fine as the game is in alpha, but you can't really call them great achievements.  They are *promising* to have some truly remarkable AI, but you can't call it an achievement based on promises alone, they have to actually, well, achieve something.

And that ""world building algorithm"" Star Citizen uses is just another from of procedural generation.  It's not really any new tech."
gaming,I feel there's a general trend in this Sonic to look more horrific over time as the image is progressively altered.

gaming,no but no one has been as aggressive as Epic and willing to spend as much money as Epic. I just can't see them doing all this and just allowing their exclusives to work on steam. it would be like microsoft allowing Halo to work on ps4.
gaming,"Dragon Age Origins, Star Wars Kotor"
gaming,Wait but will steam keep on getting updates?
gaming,Less cringey than the official though.
gaming,Yea but the point is there would be some lag time before 'voting with your wallet' would hit the company's bottom line. As someone suggests the trend more likely shows people pulling out because they lost faith.

gaming,"Comfort will get better pretty fast. Variable focus isn't that far off and would mostly get rid of headaches and eye-strain. Using waveguides or pancakes lenses, you can get much smaller headsets that are more akin to visors.

On the flipside, VR is already making unhealthy people healthier by getting active.

&gt;  Also that setup is expensive and certainly will never become widespread to already projected communities.

Camera tracking is fairly cheap. Other hardware costs will come down in time. I mean you can get a full VR portable console for $400 now. All technologies start out expensive."

2) Source?"
gaming,"Funnily enough I think the Sonic movie might actually do relatively OK for anyone who doesn't really know about Sonic.  Aside from his design the movie looks, well I wouldn't say great, but it doesn't really seem to be far off from a lot of other movies in terms of quality (granted from what little we see).  The jokes weren't *terrible* and without the ""Oh my god what did they do to Sonic"" element I could see it being amusing.  Plus Jim Carrey might actually be able to own that role pretty well and might carry the movie a good bit.

I don't think it's going to be a great movie, but I don't think it's going to the giant flaming disaster a lot of people are saying either."
gaming,Yes what Steam was doing before was horrid. I’m so glad Epic is doing all of this to give us a competitive and better gaming experience.
gaming,"Yeah I know but if you’re considering buying it and want to know if it’s good or not, you’re not going to click the option to include sabotage in result.

gaming,"Talk about minimum viable product! I don't know what the management methodology used for Fallout 4 was, but if it was Agile/Scrum, I would cite it as an anecdotal example of how the soul is getting sucked out of video game production.

gaming,There’s also a handful of games that will only play on the “new 3DS” series of consoles
gaming,What is the actual issue with games not being sold through steam?
gaming,New one has c stick and better amibo support
gaming,"I hope you are wrong, Blizzard doesn't deserve to be saved just by re-releasing their good games. I was gonna play Classic, but with BFA being so awful I refuse to resub."
gaming,Thanks for the information ! Every grow smarter !
gaming,"No need to choose, pick both?"
gaming,17 at the oldest
gaming,"There’s a mini analog stick, better 3D tracking, they moved the game card slot, and coloured buttons"
gaming,"It is in my case, 98% of my library is on steam and the same goes for the majority of PC gamers"
gaming,"I am not sure, but maybe a 23 would be better with the budget. I think you'll have more (if any...?) Viable options looking at 23 inches. And if your rig is 600, you'll probably want the 1920x1080 on a 23 instead of a 27. 

Just a thought. Good luck man!"
gaming,Doesn't he look a bit like that new sonic?
gaming,"Yeah... ""collecting"" passengers sounds ominous given the gameplay we've seen so far."
gaming,I don't need it.... I don't need it.... I NEEEED IIIIIT
gaming,"This is the game I played as a 5 year old! I haven't seen it in like 20+ years. My sister played Oregon trail, she never let me play. So I never let her play mine lol. She didn't want to anyways"
gaming,I printed this for a 7 years old kid. I really hope he will enjoy painting this and that will become a life long hobby for him.
gaming,"To get this shit off of r/gaming and into the appropriate subs:

- r/cosplay

- r/cosplaygirls"
gaming,"This is awesome. Unfortunately, fighting games get no love here if they aren't smash. Ironic considering this is a gaming sub."
gaming,Would not be the first or even the second time they switch from steam to epic on release.
gaming,Hey that's my Walmart too
gaming,"First rule of technology

How can we use it to masturbate."
gaming,but for how long is the question. and what about the next game they buy off? will they get more aggressive if they don't see the jump in users and revenue they thought they will?
gaming,This is more traumatic than watching 2 girls one cup as a kid.
gaming,I hate that his eyes look like his mouth now
gaming,"That's pretty cheap of a split considering how much an engine commercial license usually costs.

It's a not like they aren't getting something for that 5% split."
gaming,That looks terrifying and awesome.
gaming,"EA is a publisher, not a developer."
gaming,cmon man i’m trying to help :(
gaming,You spelled one word correctly
gaming,would you really even call what we saw in that trailer eggman? to me it looked more like jim carrey playing jim carrey in eggman cosplay like deadshot in suicide squad was just will smith cosplaying dead shot.
gaming,Didn’t fortnite defeat apex because after the launch spike apex went to meh status because the devs barely put any noticeable changes in compared to fortnite
gaming,Agreed.  Picard is a paragon of behavior and belief.  Working to be more like him is a worthy endeavour.
gaming,"He actually only knows 2. 

Judgement and Perish Song. Definitely hacked though, his Perish song is instant and doesn't affect him."
gaming,Just wanna point that out
gaming,"EA doesn’t make games, they are producers not developers"
gaming,The hands still seem freakishly small.
gaming,"Except this isn't competition, this is trading one devil for another and this new devil is much much worse then the old one, even though they want to fool you into believing they are an angel.

The people getting upset at this because of Tencent are either fools, ill informed or paid shills. I have played and play 2 games that have been bought by Tencent and nothing has changed for the worse in those games. Tencent just wants to make money but unlike Epic they don't try to mess with things that are working (and making them money). Epic wants 100% of the money even if that amount of money is less, Tencent just wants whatever pie gives them the most money regardless of the percentage. 

The Tencent argument holds no water. The Epic Games Store being bad and their Epic's business practices being bad on the other hand DO.

The reason ""nobody"" is complaining about exclusivity on the consoles is because consoles players are used to this, this has been common practice all the way back to the NES era, so that means people have gotten used to it, also there are people that complain about console exclusivity all the time, so there is controversy, it's just not as loud.  It's also worth keeping in mind that most current console exclusivity is very different than what is going on here with Epic. Most console exclusives are games that either would have never been made in the first place, games created by companies that are either fully or partly owned by the specific console manufacturer or companies that get heavily funded by that console manufacturer. The developers work from the ground up very closely with that manufacturers during the creation of that game. The manufacturer also puts in a lot of effort and money into promoting that game. 

What Epic is doing here on the other hand is finding games that other people have worked hard on and just throwing enough money at these people where it becomes very difficult to say no. They don't put in any of the work, they just rain money."
gaming,"Blizzard of course.  
Hate them cos their games to addictive.  
But can't stop play them, cos they too addictive."
gaming,This terrifies me beyond comfort
gaming,2.5x more people bought metro exodus on EGS than the 2 previous games on steam. And 40% of people on EGS do not have steam.
gaming,/u/GallowBoob would have a *really* hurty arm
gaming,"The buttons are still there, the start/select are the tiny buttons below the yxab buttons"
gaming,With a few more steps this can become a paper boat that floats!
gaming,"Metro only got a major fan base AFTER Last Light. Exodus was going to sell better, no matter what."
gaming,Epics choice to focus on funding exclusives instead of bettering their platform is an anti-consumer stance designed to build monopolies and avoid the competitive market.
gaming,wow this is cool
gaming,"You get one home button one start button and one select button , it's just the same but placement is different , i prefer the newer one"
gaming,"Yep, only heard good things about those if you can get them on sale."
gaming,i tried the hyperx at the store and they werent comfy i might get the steelseries arcris 3 since it feels nice and apparently it sounds very very good with the right eq
gaming,"You have to fuel your epic games hate when anyone says anything, don't you?"
gaming,"sure, just please downvote me"
gaming,"You use inches but use a foreign monetary symbol, COMMUNIST"
gaming,"and yet going to court for pirating licenses and  
refusing refunds is any better ill take the lower money share thank you

also your comment, tell that youtube XD who clearly dont want to make money"
gaming,And any remote Criticism of America automatically makes them the villian
gaming,"I kinda wish SEGA would have just somehow scrapped the whole movie and took that hit vs letting Sonic be the way he is here. I know SEGA hates it too, but this is nothing but something else for people to joke about."
gaming,"&gt; Are people really that desperate to remove themselves from reality that they're willing to go to these lengths just to simulate it in a digital world?

how do you know were not a simulation? also life isnt good to everyone 

&gt;The whole idea of Ready Player One is that the Oasis isn't some fantastic thing and that it causes problems throughout all of society

the only reason it causes problems is because literally 99.9% of every human is using it 24/7 i can guarantee u that there will always people who dont want to be in virtual reality the movie is completely unrealistic and its funny that you would even use that as an argument"
gaming,Yes it will and will receive new content as well
gaming,You know that Sony has exclusives too right?
gaming,"I knew VR was getting advanced, but I didn’t realise it was at this level already! This an absolute marvel of human achievement, people dreamed of this technology a hundred years ago and we have it. 

This shit really blows my mind"
gaming,Almost like they had to lay off 7% of their support staff because of the poor release schedule.
gaming,"I mean yes to your first points. It has stabilized but it has not recovered or even particularly started to recover. it is still trading well bellow its median range for the past year. And at the graph shows there have been up and down fluctuations since November 2018. This graph looks like just the previous year of their stock price, so I cannot find much fault with the graph. 

&amp;#x200B;

The stock market is how people feel about companies. not the dollars and cents of the company. Bad optics like the event in question can have a negative impact. But it can be negligible depending on what happens after. Blizzard didn't put out much to waylay peoples fears, also when they announced in February that they would have 0 mainline titles for any of their games come out during 2019. (which I think is odd because Warcraft 3: Reforged comes out this year. and as many pieces have said, if they made their big announcement Warcraft 3: Reforged and not Diablo Eternal people would have perceived the event much more positively. ) That did not help revitalize peoples interests or investors interests that they would be generating any large scale profit making ventures. 

&amp;#x200B;

But optics do matter. What the company says and how people respond ABSOLUTELY maters. Just look at Elon Musk and Tesla. His use of twitter in talking to people has a huge impact on the company. So much so to the point that the SEC had to penalize him to stop him from doing those things to prevent artificial manipulation of his companies value. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I feel your main point was probably to stand up to the general circle jerk that is this subreddit about gamers patting themselves on the back and feeling like the best people ever. So i mean your intentions are true and i applaud them."
gaming,Epic Games is gonna use their fortnite money to pull shit like this. I just have to wonder what other Steam games Epic will poach in the coming year.
gaming,"Shh, they hate things and don't know how stocks work."
gaming,No meme lasts forever. Except Buscemi eyes. Buscemi eyes are eternal.
gaming,"in addition to the post I just made, I actuallyjust ordered a rift S. I get it in may, and its because I cant even buy the index in Canada right now. Im not waiting till august, especially since I just sold my vive in anticipation for the index. Ill still be buying the index, just not right now. So yea, that's how much I love VR after owning a vive for 3 years."
gaming,"Not so long ago I was saying to a friend that the next leap would be that, instead of cumbersome equipment, we would find a way to input the signal directly to the brain. He told me we're still light years from that.

Last week I read a promising breakthrough that translated thought to speech; the really cool part is that, instead of trying to read and decode the speech signal, they managed to identify the pattern that moves the mouth, jaw and such and translated those movements into speech.

It's not perfect, we're not there yet, but we cannot underestimate how fast things can change."
gaming,Well now he just looks stoned out of his mind.
gaming,"Well the ""no microtransactions"" was said during the stream today."
gaming,"Do it, the other game I would say to get is ""Horizon zero Dawn"", both are excellent"
gaming,Hate ea love pvz
gaming,Came here to say this aswell
gaming,"It would probably take a lawsuit for something like removing user purchases to happen, some companies like apple do it with movies and music but I am unsure if this is due to the platform or the licensing perspective"
gaming,*pre bee shield nerf. Holy hell was that thing broken. Still good post nerf but man I miss the good old days of it just shredding everything
gaming,Eu4 and Hoi4 are the closest I know to that description. Except in those it’s a nation not just a city.
gaming,Thank you! It's kind of ridiculous how people are acting about this.
gaming,Is the book worth a read?
gaming,"Oh boy... season 3 is where it REALLY takes off. You have some truly fantastic television in your future.

I wish I could watch Best of Both Worlds for the first time again!"
gaming,"epics not the answer yes the high money is good, but the business model they created is horrible and theyve gone to court and lost most if not all of them because of it, epic is the next disney and comcast"
gaming,Theres a lot of gaming venues that have popped up recently around town
gaming,I wish the XL versions kept the shape of the original. The screen is bigger but the 3DS looks so much tidier than the 3DS XL
gaming,"There is no VR on the market that would give you an immersive experience for under $1500, and the computing power needed to run VR at any comparable capacity won’t go down for at least a decade or a superior and unpredictable technology surpasses it. 

I genuinely don’t believe we’ll have a VR world to any extent because of all the other political and environmental that would come first."
gaming,Maybe it took him this long to understand it?
gaming,"Can epic fuck off already. Your shit, stop embarassing yourself. Just accept that steams the alpha and omega when it comes to gaming platforms"
gaming,"I'm about to sound ignorant as hell, but I didn't know north Korea even allowed video games."
gaming,The guy from fury road looked cute and sounded cool when he actually spoke the guy from the video game was meh
gaming,Well nioh is literally a copy of dark souls but alot easier in a way while being more fluid and fast place like sekiro. So if you like both you'll love Nioh to
gaming,"My 2.5yr old isn't this stupid.  When his brother hands him a controller while paying Mario Kart he asks ""what's my guy?"" wanting to know which player he is on the screen.  Of course he drives into the wall 95% of the time and pauses the game the other 5% but he sure knows that he is making stuff happen!"
gaming,Not if epic keeps buying everything
gaming,"The filmmakers are not fans. They could care less what Sonic looks like.  
They want to make a cheap buck.   
Your childhood will always show up on sale later on in life."
gaming,Then don’t say it.
gaming,"&gt; Metro only got a major fan base AFTER Last Light. Exodus was going to sell better, no matter what.

So...?

Evidently their new store is popular, given that it's sold at least ~320,000 copies."
gaming,Finally finished the epilogue for rdr2 yesterday... Don't know what to play now.
gaming,"That's true, mirror's edge for instance, I have on steam."
gaming,The entitlement of gamers is definitely fueling the big stupid fire
gaming,seriously? should i watch it?
gaming,Didn’t know many people played the vita like me
gaming,"yeup. Blizzard is likely to announce some big projects this blizzcon, They have been hiring people for unlisted development projects over the past few years so something new must be coming down the pipes."
gaming,"I was under the impression that the fat bald Eggman is him after making it back to ""Sonics world"", which I assume is the actual one from the comics.  There's hope for a sonic transformation as well - but it would still be a really poor decision on their part to use this... thing.. for 99% of the movie.  There won't be a sequel if this one tanks, obviously."
gaming,What does the c stick do?
gaming,"It’s not fantastic, buts it’s fun. Like a popcorn movie, don’t expect anything deep or meaningful, but especially if you have a lot of 80s nostalgia is a good time"
gaming,"This is why Fortnite is cancer to gaming. Not because the game sucks but because Epic has shown it's true colors. With micro transactions that take advantage of children, they could afford to make shady business practices all they want."
gaming,Mobile 'gamers' are like people who call themselves programmers because they can use an excel spreadsheet.
gaming,"Xbox as well dude. Haha actually agree with everything you said; 5 minute major was not fair to them, 2 min minor would have been fine. But in response to that, they had been killing it and we were lost for 3 straight games, just play your game and maybe a goal or 2 tops cause of the momentum but to allow 4 that fast...the moment was up for grabs and we took it. That’s why you play the game! And yea, it really looked like the whole team was like hey they just hurt our Captain let’s go take this."
gaming,Unfortunately I don't believe they'll be released again. I tried to find one but missed the sale wave
gaming,I think where VR can really be good is in nursing homes
gaming,You miss 100% of the shots you dont take
gaming,"Boneworks is going to get me back into VR, I'll give you that. Can't wait to play around in there, it looks amazing."
gaming,That’s this one haha
gaming,Why would they?? The only competitor Epic has is Steam. PS4 is a different platform and stopping to sell on PS4 wouldn't make any sense.
gaming,"Repost, literally saw this titled “(game) proves the earth is round”"
gaming,"Good to know, if I see it for a reasonable price I'll probably pick it up and try it out"
gaming,"Looks amazing, congratulations! Loving the trailer music, who composed it?"
gaming,It's like a right analog but doesnt move around at all I think it might be pressure sensitive
gaming,YOU don’t think it feels good. Battlefront 2 is a masterpiece.
gaming,"I’ve seen the movie I liked it, just wondering what the book is like"
gaming,Oh shit you're right! Didn't even think about that. This makes that so much easier.
gaming,Valve didn't sign exclusivity deals. There is no problem with a developer making the choice to only sell in one place.
gaming,I'm still in the dark as much as you buddy. I think top commenter is working his ass off to identify it and is investing serious money for new equipment to get the job done. It's out of my hands completely (in the US right now) but no id as of yet. The cartridge insides were badly deteriorated. Fingers crossed
gaming,"Have an upvote, you seen to be getting picked on ;)"
gaming,Some people say to this day his remote still isn't connected.
gaming,"I don't think it's like metro. Cause with rocket league they now own Phyonix right? So having the games on only epic makes sense. They don't own 4A however, so metro shouldn't be exclusive. If that makes sense?"
gaming,"Gl to Epic. Now that most people have Fiber with unlimited download. Pirating has never been so easy. They can buy all the Exclusives and shit they want, any exclusive I desperately wanna play I will, for the rest I'll wait for Steam release or skip.  Funny thing, there's a 100% easier and cheaper method to push the Epic Store without any of the crap, Epic are just too dumb to figure it out."
gaming,Very true and since I've been on Xbox for years and I recently am switching to PC a little just make it look worse with people complaining about exclusives when they don't have to pay anything but just download a games launcher from epic. If it was console is have to buy a whole new console.
gaming,Wow.. you have pretty nails
gaming,"Yes, 100% yes. The movie doesn't follow the book super accurately, like the challenges to unlock the keys and gates are different but it defiantly worth the read if you enjoyed the film at all."
gaming,I think the post is about the concept of ready player one
gaming,"Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars 2: 
Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Harder"
gaming,"Oh hell yeah agreed, loving the sliding, looks really smooth and just what it needed"
gaming,"I'm always impressed with good AI! So if they pull that off I'd be so happy to see it, but I gotta agree that procedural generation type stuff isn't too ground breaking any more. Though it's still pretty cool if its implemented well enough."
gaming,Thanks! I’ll give it a go:)
gaming,It’s a use of caesura cos the top part and bottom part can be read separately
gaming,"My gf bought me one of these.  It was the first video game system I ever owned myself.  Needless to say we got married lol, and a year later she bought me a PS4!  This is the way to a man's heart."
gaming,"Its brilliant, let kids play 15-30 mins with the other kids in the store."
gaming,Slap some Offspring on that and you got a winner.
gaming,"Nope. If you got it in Steam, you will be able to download it on new computers as well. The game will even get the updates and most likely it will still be cross platform compatible."
gaming,I like that watermark. Now if only everyone did this.
gaming,Hopefully Spielberg isnt in charge so he doesnt find a way to completely massacre it.
gaming,"&gt; The problem is that Blizzard is a PC-gaming company

The stock listed is all of Activision-Blizzard.  That includes King, which is all mobile and the bulk of Activision sales are console, as well as a big chunk of Blizzard sales in D3 and Overwatch.  Plus Hearthstone is a vast majority on mobile.  Calling them a PC company shows your inherent bias as it is completely and demonstrably false."
gaming,And I still wouldn’t install shitnite
gaming,Isn't it the second? On the crazy island?
gaming,Looks like a fun intense game
gaming,"Tbh, a union would be a little bit of an old fashioned solution. We should be moving the industry toward worker owner co-ops. More profit sharing, less money going to obtrusive upper financial management and micro managers. I think anyone in this day should be working toward shared ownership of the enterprise."
gaming,"In GTA online, some friends and I found out that if you stay alive in the prison long enough, the cops just give up and you have free reign of the place without any guard NPCs left."
gaming,"Ah, finally a game simulating my daily commute!"
gaming,What game is it?
gaming,Still 3rd party 🙄
gaming,I will never buy anything from epic. but is gonna be funny when/if they fail..... epic fail.
gaming,"And then slowly they step towards each other, red's breath hot on your neck.  You inhale deeply, then lock lips."
gaming,I feel like they should just offer a slightly cheaper price on Epics games and maybe up the price a bit on Steam
gaming,"Walmart did a test run of these esports arenas in like 50 stores. Iirc they are owned by walmart and from what I understand they are performing well so we may start seeing them in more stores.

gaming,"It is not a _good_ book, but it's far more interesting than the movie. It also isn't very long so at least you won't have wasted very much time."
gaming,"They say that the steam version will still work, and get all the updates"
gaming,sorry chief but even if your able to change your appearence  and your jesus kun you wont have anime girls pawning for you
gaming,Hope the buttons have RGB back light
gaming,"For RTS you should try Starcraft II. It has a long campaign with 3 playable races and lot of content, so you don't need to play online.  
For TBS I recommend you Civilization V."
gaming,"I impulse bought it because I loved the movie so much and ended up loving it, visually appealing and fun game play in an open post-apocalyptic world, a bit repetitive at times but re-playable for sure, good game"
gaming,"While story migth not be the best (i personally think it's pretty good) imo the gameplay is where it shines , the bike handling is fantastic (reminds me of gta 4's the lost &amp; damned) , movement feels very nice and fluid , gunplay and melee combat is only ok though , the world is beautiful and the hordes are a real challenge and really fun to take down. 
I'd say it's worth a buy if you like zombie games."
gaming,Appreciate the response! It just seems like Epic is doing what any company really tries to do. Gain a competitive edge against the competition. I do see though how forcing consumers to use certain platforms to play a game really just makes it harder for them. I just seen a lot of reactionary responses and then the anti circle jerk to the reactionary responses but its good to see most people probably have this well thought out view point towards it.
gaming,"""You either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain."""
gaming,I loved this game but the only problem I had was that it was too realistic for my liking. It’s the only problem I have with every sports game other than MLB the show. Everything is too realistic. I want it to be slightly more of an arcade where player movements don’t affect speed of the game. Spin moves and juke moves in madden slow down the runner drastically not to mention it drains his stamina. Same thing in fifa. And the cutting in NHL is great but I want to be able to cut and keep some speed. That’s my only problem lol. Other than that the games are fun as hell.
gaming,"Wrong. Their store wasn’t more popular, it was the only option if you didn’t preorder. Hence, the only way to play it was to buy through Epic."
gaming,"I was okayish at it for a tiny bit, only played because my friend wanted me to.

Going back to other games after it was hard because I was becoming used to the CS recoil/spray patterns... OW, BO3 and especially Battlefield(hardcore mode only), with leading target and bullet drop not a thing in CS, it really hurt my K/D and SPM in battlefield

I said fuck it and only played zombies and surf maps after that"
gaming,If you already owned the game you'll keep it and they will still support it with the same updates and DLC this is just manchildren whining.
gaming,Y'all ever play Battle Cats? That's the shit right there.

gaming,Yeah makes sense. I dunno figure if someone can offer them a better deal (to make them stop selling on PS4) they'd take it. Sorry I asked a dumb question.

gaming,"I agree for the most part, but if they ever remaster Oblivion or the original Red Dead Redemption, then I'm buying it asap"

gaming,We are the center of the universe ya know
gaming,"Thats a comparison for the company that chose to go over. Addressing the ""worry"" that a company would lose out on sales by switching to EGS. When multiple games have sold more than what they would have on steam. With metro exodus being the biggest comparison."
gaming,Now if they could only make cling wrap that actually fucking sticks!
gaming,"There was Imagine but its a little late for that train and also another smt on pc I believe

For me there probably isn't one, most of the companies I dislike I dislike due to them making shitty games"
gaming,"Such a good game, had the prospects to be a great game. But the combat held it back. Not the car combat, that was great. Was always hoping for a sequel, was sure the combat would have been tuned up and everything else improved on. Would have been a hell of a game.

BTW the storms in Mad Max were hands down the coolest part of that game. Always got my heart racing seeing that front coming my way!"

gaming,I think the most worse was when Activision merged with Blizzard.
gaming,"&gt; Wrong. Their store wasn’t more popular, it was the only option if you didn’t preorder. Hence, the only way to play it was to buy through Epic.

..Their store *is* popular, that's at least ~320,000 copies. Do you not understand this? That is an objective measure. You can't just claim it's not true, cause it factually is true!"
gaming,"Full paragraph, TL;DR per se:

""A big topic in the gaming industry recently is development crunch. Some studios make their teams work 14 hour days to pack every patch full of the most fixes and improvements possible. Sometimes when we read our own Patch Notes threads and community feedback, we feel that we are being asked to do the same. I will not run this company that way. While there's inevitably a bit of optional paid overtime near league releases, the vast majority of a Path of Exile development cycle has great work/life balance. This is necessary to keep our developers happy and healthy for the long-term, but it does mean that some game improvements will take a while to be made."""

gaming,"Eurogamer posted an [update](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-01-epic-acquires-psyonix-will-remove-rocket-league-from-sale-on-steam-later-this-year) to this, with Epic stating that they have ""not announced plans to stop selling the game"" on Steam. Which these days means diddly squat, might as well mean that they're gonna announce it soon.

In any case, assuming they will stop selling it on steam, how the fuck is that gonna work with such a heavy multiplayer focused game, which such heavy integration of the steam community system? Will I still be able to interact with my steam friends, or are we all going to have to move over to the Epic Store (once they have a friends system (if they don't have that yet, at this point I'm uncertain as to the lack of features of the Epic Store))? If Steam friends remain supported, how is it going to work in combination with the Epic Store? What if I introduce a friend to the game, but they HAVE to buy it on the Epic Store, then what?

To say the least, I'm not so reassured by the statement that we can still play on Steam. Knowing Epic at this point, what's to stop them from just stopping support on Steam and forcing everyone to buy it again on the Epic Store?"

Both the first and the second metro games were good, really good but outside of the Russia/Eastern Europe and people who read the book it was based on it was relatively unknown. the second game got a bit more traction. 
Same as Witcher  games. The first one flew past a lot of radars but got enough for the second one to get made. The second one gathered quite a following but it was the third game that really hit it. 

Plus digital is making a lot more business these days than in the days when the first two games were made. You can't just put those numbers out and say as if it's entirely Epic's achievement. It's not. The market is not the same, the conditions for the game release are not the same."

This is what the book says. But it's not necessarily correct.

This conclusion is purely that of the authors. And he was stiffed by the limits of game development philosophy of his time.

The author was also trying to tell a story, and constructed a world based around the premise of the tech destroying society, as opposed to it being a necessarily accurate prediction.

Oddly enough, the regular office chairs sold here that fit my criteria are far more expensive than the gaming chairs.

I'm 190/6'3, want the back to be high enough + a headrest. I'm also quite underweight so I want the entire chair to be cushioned, including armrests.

The office chairs I've found in furniture &amp; office supply shops that are big and comfy enough are priced far more expensive than the gaming varieties sold at gaming / PC shops. The gaming varieties are just as comfy or more so than the office equivalents, with the exception of armrests being skimped on.

You are pissed because now you have to either switch your service to Amazon and abandon Netflix, add Amazon Streaming to your services which doubles your bills, or stick with Netflix but you wouldn't be able to watch your show on there again. Now imagine if your favorite game was on Steam and your friend wants to join in multiplayer with you but he doesn't have the game. He then decides to get it on the Epic Game store (because that's where it is exclusively) and you are left without being able to play with him because you bought the game when it was on Steam.

gaming,"The thing is that Epic is doing this at the expense of the consumer. What Epic is doing is of ZERO benefit for the consumers, there is no upside here, if you are a developer on the other hand there are many benefits, but you gotta consider if those benefits outweigh the downsides for the consumer.

Let's go back to when the Origin and Uplay hate was going around, people hated those launchers, some of it warranted and some of it unwarranted. Let's be honest those launchers were pretty bad when they first came out, but after some time they fixed those launchers and now hardly enough complains about them like that anymore. Hell Origin was even the first to offer refunds and which were very likely one of the reasons that Steam ended up finally offering refunds too.

People are still annoyed that they need yet another launcher to play their games but for the most part if they like the game enough they deal with it and play. We can even play and buy Ubisoft games directly from Steam (even if the Uplay launcher gets in between while playing).

If Epic would take games that look great but are struggling to make it and give them money instead and helped them and in exchange for that those games are EGS exclusive the complaints wouldn't be this big.

If EGS wants to build a base, they need to reward players for choosing their store instead of punishing players for choosing another. Instead of earning a base they are simply trying to steal it."

gaming,"It also makes no sense because if you bought the developer now your goal is making money, so you would want it in steam. If you just wanted to sell the game on your platform why not just buy the exclusive rights to sell it like Sony did with Destiny DLC for a year."

gaming,"Available may 2019, it’s May, and 2019, how much? Is it?"
gaming,"Nope. I'd rather they left their current employers and went the indie route; unions stagnate whole industries, at premiums far higher than 5%, and in videogaming in particular would only encourage moving all development overseas. Think your current game is buggy? wait until it's done by a team of chinese devs working at $1 per hour.


Besides, sure, more money could help, but also lowering the unrealistic standards most gamers have today. Look at Anthem, for instance: how much work do you think needs to be done before the game is polished? and how much time do you think the anthem sub is willing to give them for it? exactly. It's Fred Brooks' Mythical Man-Month all over, you can't just fix it throwing cash around."

gaming,"&gt; There is no VR on the market that would give you an immersive experience

Do you mean immersive in general or immersive at *this* level? Because VR is already very immersive even with relatively cheap headsets.

&gt; for under $1500

The tech here isn't expensive aside from the haptic gloves which will eventually be more affordable. Otherwise it would require some cameras, and really that's it. Most of this is software based and not going to add much to cost.

&gt; or a superior and unpredictable technology surpasses it.

You can't replace VR. It's a medium of it's own, and whatever tries to surpass it is just another form of VR."
gaming,"-EDITED FOR CLARITY-

Totally expected that... I still can’t figure out what this means on the long term both for Psyonix and for the RL players since the game will still be on Steam.


From a distance, I can’t help but see Steam and Epic like two toddlers arguing. One has many toys and is perfectly chill. The other one has the biggest toy ever but sill screams, wants everything, and eventually gets what he wants.

I know comparing to toddlers is really a stretch but that was the first thing that came to my mind after reading the news, I literally did just wake up and read it. No point in editing further this after two days, but yeah the idea is that Epic is really trying its best to harass Steam."

gaming,"That is not actually true. Just like FTP MMO's, just because you are not paying does not mean that the company isn't earning any money ""from you"", paying players are a lot more likely to pay if there are more players in that game.

Are you really going to buy things in a game or even play that game if that game is dead? Probably not, but if there are a lot of other people, even if all those other people don't pay a single cent, you are more likely to buy and play that game."

Most phones these days dwarf the power of the Gameboy Advance and are even capable of running PS1 titles.

I am an industrial designer and change stuff that updates everything in pdm.  I am not sure if companies have a setup like that, but I imagine it is possible.  I would think they could still do small changes to a model right up to final render.

4. STEAM Index lists native Linux support.

There's literally thousands of games now fully playable on Linux. The argument of ""not profitable"" does not hold water. The market is clearly big enough to draw developers to it.

gaming,"I don't think you're applying ""uncanney valley"" quite right here. Uncanney Valley is when something appears just barely not human and it causes an eery feeling."
gaming,Yeah there's a new one
gaming,"I think Classic will end up looking a lot like WildStar where the nostalgia factor will give them one good month and then spectacularly implode.

While WoW was amazing for the time, I think everyone is going to miss all the QOL added since then a lot more than they realize."
gaming,I am nearly certain it took a bunch of people to screw this up so badly. No one person could have accomplished such fuckery on their own.
gaming,But even those people know left from right.
gaming,"First thing that popped in my head was this song. 

Have you ever been high as fuck?

gaming,You can see sonic and not hear Jaleel White?
gaming,"If you already own it on Steam, you will be able to play it no?"
gaming,"You're missing the point it's not about getting a game on pc, PC always had competition in regards of game selling platforms, which was somehow homologous on steam (you could buy from different stores but play your shit on steam) but now we have epic games, buying out developers of games (already on steam) and most likely taking the chance to buy out or activate the game in there, then instead of just costing 15.99$ - a % on market competition (being in so many stores, everyone trying to sell the same game it gets discounted fair often) they can then sell it for 80$ if they want because NO ONE can compete with them selling the game, so you either buy it at 99 $ (look, they just decided the game is worth more money because you guys keep falling for the FOMO) and there's nowhere else you can do to get the game, this is obviously an exageration but the problem remains, EGS is taking all the competition market out of the PC enviroment and sooner rather than later it's not going to be compelling for anyone to buy games on PC if this trend continues, so EGS will die, steam will start to fade away, and games overall are going to go full service, if this happens then games are no longer games (the product) but a service, and that is another problem, hence the actual problem with NETFLIX, etc etc. people are developing ways to destroy ownership of things to keep getting the little money you have from the work that pays a shit, this is just a depressing enviroment overall (i know i got a little bit out of topic, but the point remains)   


THIS is not about just hating EGS becuse they developed fortnite, this is about people being enraged because someone is applying chinesse tactics on PC to keep competition out of the game, thus having full monopoly of distribution of something, and being able to charge whatever the fuck they want for something (there's also the problem of EGS having way too little features that are important for people on the PC gaming market, but that is a different problem they have to solve)."
gaming,"Let me poke around online a bit, and I’ll be able to answer you better. Its something like a guy says he can’t find his daughter, and you find her with a hurt leg by the river, I believe. Then you hand her your spear and she upgrades your melee and other things I BELIEVE. I played it at launch, so it’s been a bit.

Edit: [Here’s this thing I found](https://www.primagames.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/tips/horizon-zero-dawn-how-upgrade-your-spear) and I think [it’s located here] (https://m.ign.com/wikis/horizon-zero-dawn/In_Her_Mother's_Footsteps)"

gaming,I have an android so it wouldn't focus lol. I can see how that might be a little sus
gaming,"Just a normal picture editor, but I’m just about at that point."
gaming,Don’t diss my dude wailmer
gaming,Actually most will love on to other games as shown by the games absolute PLUMMETING approval rating. Just because most you know are tools doesn’t mean most gamers are. If you had a fucking brain you would have read where I said a different game not that one moron
gaming,Yes. The only way to say it.
gaming,"The worst part, absolutely worst part, is Detective Pikachu has just proven it's possible to take cartoon characters with some of the most bizarre anatomies possible and give them enough realism to fit in a live-action movie. There's no longer an excuse to get things this wrong. Break down what Detective Pikachu did and use that as a basis to design your characters."
gaming,True that if you're ever looking for a drop in on the eashl just lmk decent on defense decent on goalie alright as forward
gaming,"I hated that as a kid, I had the tools to be able to play the games on the N64, I had, I think, Pokemon Stadium? That came with the pokepod plug in thing, but I didn't have a N64 aha.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy though mate!"
gaming,"and multiplayer is free now i think, plus theres tons of resources to learn (sc2)"
gaming,"In that case. You may be interested in playing medabots for the gba. You said you played pokemon and  IMO, medabots was almost on par with the pokemon games of that time"

gaming,"I completed Red Dead 2 two days ago. It was amazing, but don’t rush the story. Take your time, do side quests, explore, etc. Also if the story isn’t that good so far, it gets better later on in like Chapter 3."
gaming,I imagine so but I have no clue myself.
gaming,"The price is great, and a ton of great reviews that I saw. Thank you!"
gaming,I have perfect vision and it still ain't right
gaming,You still get to keep your copy it just can't be bought on steam anymore
gaming,Does anyone know who made judgement call for Sonics appearance? Cant find any info on Google
gaming,"Would love this... like Sonic is out of shape, wrinkles and bags under his eyes, washed up, his best years are behind him... until he's compelled to get his speed back, get his head right... and save the world (voiced by Danny Devito)"
gaming,This looks a bit like the tracks from Asphalt 8.
gaming,"Do you know much effort it would take to completely re-do sonic? 

Neither do I, but it seems like a lot of work and more importantly, money"
gaming,...and also a non-trivial chance of death.
gaming,"Not partnered, *sold*. Epic *bought* them."
gaming,In what way does it ruin the game? It is still the same game after all but on a different launcher. If you buy a toothpaste at market 1 and the same paste at market 2 it doesn't change the product in any way.
gaming,"Yup, I'm still mad about Ashen."
gaming,"As someone who rarely plays strategy games, and has plenty more experience with the FPS genre, I found Genesis Alpha One on PS4 to be a pleasant surprise. It may not be the most sophisticated strategy game, and in fact much of it is more akin to a simulator, but it's enthralling and fun. You essentially build, manage, and control a space vessel while exploring solar systems. This involves harvesting resources, researching new weaponry and DNA for your crew of clones, and continually expanding your ship. For me, the first-person camera view made it a much more immersive and compelling experience, compared to the point-and-click style used for most PC strategy games."
gaming,"* Sonic walks into a college with a skateboard and sees his friend from the trailer talking to his friends *

gaming,Restyle makes me want to break out my Genesis and hunt for those Chaos Emeralds
gaming,Ok imma buy it
gaming,I completely forgot it's purely children who design and produce video games...
gaming,"Okay look dude im all about the ""epic bad"" meme, but that's some stupid shit you just said there. 

You're really saying that if given the choice between downloading a client and paying 200 dollars, you'd pick paying 200 dollars? There's no getting around how dumb that is. That's not sending a message, that's being financially irresponsible."
gaming,Or they could be from europe and that’s the correct way to say it.
gaming,Thank you. I've been using the standard wired iPhone earbuds so this is a step up.
gaming,OK. No No No No No!
gaming,With those eyes I imagine David Spade being the voice actor with Sonic being high 24/7
gaming,"I don't know how you outgrow a games store, they will certainly ha e more titles by then."
gaming,"""This video game headset is connected to my vital organs? What could go wrong?"""
gaming,"They do in fact, 88% revenue in Epic and 70 up to 80% (depending on success of the game) in steam. 

That's something they could improve indeed, but when you have a product that is going to cost the same to make anyway and you can sell it in a place that gives you more revenue but has less audience, and another a bit worse on revenue but a humongous audience... why not both? why choose? 

The problem is the feeling that leaves on a consumer. Even with the quick buck these companies are making with the exclusivity, I'm pretty sure in the long run they are going to lose $ just in the form of players for the game. And also for anything they do in the future, just out of spite from the players that felt forced to follow a path they didn't want to, without a REALLY valid reason."
gaming,"VR headsets are getting really advanced, but haptic devices are still really far behind. Your body can feel things like shape, texture (smooth vs. rough), temperature, sharpness, airflow and acceleration. Some of those things can be simulated with experimental devices, but not all of them. Few of these devices even leave the lab, and if they ever make it to market, they are way too expensive and specialized for mass adoption."
gaming,It's okay to do meth as many times if you want to as long as you don't realize it's meth. It can't hurt you that way.

gaming,Meanwhile in an alternate universe
gaming,Wow. Definitely not what I expected to see in this sub.
gaming,"Why the fuck is that guy getting downvoted?  
  
I personally don’t care if chinese gov knows what games I play. Firstly, it’s just rumors. Secondly, I don’t think it can affect me in any way for the next 50 years.  
  
However I do care that Steam may become a bit less of a monopoly which means that gamedevs get better conditions. I see most of you agree that if the game in the OP will become Epic exclusive then it’s terrible but it’s not some AAA title — so if the small dev team gets 2 times more money, or even just 20% more money, isn’t it great? Are you too lazy to make an account?"
gaming,I dont know if I have enough
gaming,this looks amazing LOL
gaming,Matt is really just Doc Lewis in his prime
gaming,I love the functional rear view mirror on a bus a mile long
gaming,Depends on your country I believe both europe and Australia have ruled that purchase of a game is classified as ownership not a timed license
gaming,"Totally agree there. Where I certainly miss all of the complexity with skills (for example, stance dancing with macros to use warrior abilities locked to certain stances) and hate all the abilities that were pruned off, there are very nice QOL changes over time that make the game so much more fun to play."
gaming,"Dude, upgrading from the normal GBA to the SP with the backlight was like the best thing to happen to younger me, all night Pokemon gaming aha"
gaming,"He said he played with his older brother for seven years.  


He said nothing about being a child at the time.

gaming,"Or call themself an artist, do whatever they want, and live under the bridge."
gaming,That’s dope af man! She’s a keeper!
gaming,"I second the other person, absolutely worth it. I've read it twice but recently listened to an audio book version and Wil Wheaton does a great job narrating if that's more your thing."
gaming,"&gt;*no common sense and idea who your franchise's target audience is*

They probably have a better idea than the people who still think they're the target audience..."
gaming,"I understand that many people dislike epic but still. If steam wanted to have exclusivity I am pretty sure they could make their offer, couldn't they. It is not like the producer is forced to take epics offer."
gaming,"I pre-ordered through steam

&amp;#x200B;

was a good buy."
gaming,Last stop. *the entirety of New York exits the train at different ends of the city*
gaming,Use your skills to make art just for yourself so the client work is less soul crushing.
gaming,"They're trying to gain a larger share, Steam basically has a monopoly right now but yeaaaa fuck Epic Games for trying to create competition."
gaming,"Not the same thing. I get your grievances but with streaming, the bills would stack. You don't pay for game launchers, so there's no additional cost to consumer, just mild inconvenience."
gaming,"Damn, I lent my last 3.50 to the Loch Ness monster."
gaming,You should post this on r/scorkeepers
gaming,"Are you concerned that they own Roit games?  What about the other companies they partly own? Like ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard, and Take-Two?"
gaming,if its so much money on the line though and so much time definitely went into this did they never stop to think that maybe this looked creepy as all fuck
gaming,I hope the Crazy Bus soundtrack is in this.
gaming,"Yes, that's  what I'm trying to say"
gaming,"They aren't, but this thinking isnt consumer oriented"
gaming,They eyes really make a huge difference. Im glad I can sleep at night now
gaming,"Yeah, if anything's going to save this movie it'll be Carrey. He may not be able to make it good enough to be a hit, but he'll still be able to make it entertaining. He definitely has the ability to pull off a great Robotnik."
gaming,"They're buying all these games at the last second making them exclusives.... they're not offering anything

People already like steam and stream has great deals. And people already have a catalog

Epic doesn't even offer a shopping cart"
gaming,"Well duh, books use *your* imagination. Of course your mind will build this world in a way that's best *for you.* Movies have to cater to everyone.

It's also hard to condense a book into a two-hour feature, it almost never translates well to the big screen."
gaming,Was doing that before but stopped. Gonna refocus on that again.
gaming,Its not like epic games is a terrible company. I don't see how this is a bad this and why it would matter to anyone.
gaming,"Check this out:  [https://www.thevoid.com/](https://www.thevoid.com/)

They're highlighting the newest thing on their home page right now, but look at the Star Wars trailer. They've got about a dozen locations with more planned. I've done two of their things (Star Wars and Nicodemus) and it's pretty amazing."
gaming,"Steam? Monopoly? How?
Epic Monopoly? What?"
gaming,That’s not how that works bud there’s ore regulations than that and epic isn’t dumb enough to pull that shit the moment they try they will lose over half they’re customers again this really isn’t a big deal it’s like complaining about an Xbox exclusive and having an Xbox  but wanting on ps4 and crying about it by your logic Sony could sell god of war for $100 or Spider-Man for $90 that’s not how it works
gaming,More info? I have no fucking idea what you're on about lol what game company? What game?
gaming,"Board games are amazing. Wish we saw more of that on this sub. 

Scythe is one of the best. Can’t recommend it enough."
gaming,I think they are crying all the way to the bank.
gaming,"How difficult is it to crop an image, just one more tiny movement and it would have been perfection but you just had to go and screw it up just like everything else, I swear to god take this as a lesson you small man."
gaming,"Im still not sure how people dont get this

They were clearly going for a realistic aesthetic. If they wanted to just copy the game design they would have.

The issue is its impossible to do ""Realistic sonic"" without it looking like garbage. Or maybe its not, but every redesign ive seen just completely misses the point"
gaming,Obviously greater than 3.
gaming,"We're really picking nits here. FROM floppies, ok thanks."
gaming,And it is still the best VR game there is.
gaming,It’s actually fairly easy and straight forward.
gaming,"DAE hate Epic?  Upvotes to the left.

This has nothing to do with Epic.  They don't need to be mentioned in every single thread."
gaming,The one in Ft Worth Alliance area has one of these
gaming,"Also they have helped uplay gain a bigger role with the division 2,since wasn't available in steam"
gaming,Lets also not forget back when those games came out steam had very less users compared to todays 90 Million users.
gaming,Except Steam isn't run by douchebags that don't care what the end gamers want.
gaming,Bus touched itself and didn’t immediately implode 0/10 stars
gaming,I agree to disagree
gaming,I’m paying for convenience. Something not included in the free offer.
gaming,You're acting like PC players don't also have to deal with that type of exclusivity.
gaming,So you’re saying Psyonix as a company is no longer a thing and the original devs aren’t working on the game anymore???
gaming,"Doesn't seem safe, Elon."
gaming,you literally can't unsee this
gaming,"Right, I knew that. I meant to say I’m working through all of the games in order. My bad for not clarifying"
gaming,I think he may of meant steam users....
gaming,Except this is vr not ar
gaming,"&gt; No...you didn’t 

LOL WUT?"
gaming,"Thanks, I'll definently get it right next time."
gaming,It's actually on every motorcycle in Fallout 4 too
gaming,Might as well market it at this point
gaming,"When you detonated the tnt and you blew a guy's clothes off he would make little mad noises like ""mee mee mee mee"" and shake his fist. My family still uses that to this day."

gaming,Dude she thicc.  Of course this is going to the front page.
gaming,Have you tried my time at Portia?  If you like the relationship aspect of stardew you will like my time at Portia
gaming,"It may be growing but seriously come on, Linux as a market share of consumer devices is still very low - I haven’t seen any statistics that put it much beyond 3% at best.

Companies make claims about what they’re going to do all the time and then change their mind. 

I’d like them to support Linux sure, but I also get why they’re in no rush to support it there’s far more profit in supporting Windows and Mac before even considering Linux."
gaming,It's actually a pretty decent sized studio with experience working with Unreal Engine versions for many years as contractors.  It makes sense as a talent grab.
gaming,"I think he only likes chili dogs in the 90s animated series, right? I can't think of chili dogs ever being mentioned in any of the games. I haven't played a sonic game since sonic adventure 2 though, so maybe one of the newer ones do, I dunno."
gaming,That was a copy of Diablo.

gaming,Oceanhorn is also a decent Zelda clone. It should still be on iOS. Not sure about android
gaming,"need to re-watch the ""old gregg"" episodes.  So creepy!"
gaming,"Microtransactions means buy our fake money gems with real money so it doesnt feel like spending money when you buy our crap.

I am perfectly fine with spending a few bucks for something cosmetic if it is purchased directly instead of using an in game system that the player is driven to over and over to try to make the sale."
gaming,"I'm gonna give this one attempt to make you understand.

Imagine a game comes out on the ps4, and ONLY the ps4, this game is so fucking amazing that loads of people want to buy it and play it. Unfortunately for those without a ps4, they can't do that unless they get a ps4. So in order to play this game, they buy a ps4. They didn't buy the ps4 because they like the ps4, they didn't buy the ps4 because they want the ps4, they bought it, because they want this one game.

Buying the ps4 for this one game, doesn't mean they like the ps4, or that they think it is good, it means it is LITERALLY the only option. Being the only option doesn't mean you are popular, to be popular there has to be a choice, the user has to choose you over someone else, if you are the only choice, they don't choose you because they like you or think you are amazing, it's because they can't do anything else.

Popularity requires the user to wilfully choose you over another option. If Metro was also sold on steam, and the epic store ended up selling more copies than steam, that would mean they are more popular than steam, being forced to pick a certain option because there is no choice, makes people hate you, not like you. Especially when your product is worse than the competitors in terms of features and security.

Also, 320,000 is not a lot. Not in a market this big."
gaming,"Ah insulting others. Very grown up. 

You said they ruin their own game. In fact the game is the same game as it would be on steam. Or any platform. They may ruin their sales but that's all. And before you insult strangers on the internet you should rather ask your mother to teach you some manners."
gaming,"Nice, that is sure to ruffle some jimmies"
gaming,"Redditors down vote anything that they don't like no matter how small or big it is, people here don't like different opinions.

The only thing that i really don't like about The Epic Store is the buying massive triple AAA titles so people will be FORCED to use their store if they want to play it, i don't care that much about the chinese part.

But this atleast means this will force Valve to do something instead of sleeping for ten years straight."
gaming,"I agree its not a fair one, but it was created to compete with and blow away the NES,but... honestly, while Sega was fun, the more memorable games came outta nintendo, Segas were just flashier"
gaming,What exactly is wrong with fortnite apart from it being boring?
gaming,I hope it can be played in 3rd person
gaming,"What I’m saying is, being sold to someone else is not a *partnership.* it’s s *very* different kind of relationship. Not that it changes taking the game off of steam any less scummy."
gaming,Seems a little melodramatic
gaming,"It's amazing how much traction this is getting. It used to be what came out is what you get and you just dealt with it. Not that I am complaining, Sonic on the right looks way more like Sonic.

It's just interesting how things have changed over the years."
gaming,"Nah, I would say the foundation will be built during our lifetime, but it won't be full on until at the earliest another 100 years."
gaming,"Do you mean instant coffee or brewed coffee? Instant coffee is pretty much the same with those cheap bottled coffee I always buy, only difference is that 12-15 price difference. Brewed coffee might burn more holes to my wallet and with my sensitivity to caffeine, I'll be hyperactive the whole afternoon up until the tomorrow morning."
gaming,"I'm gonna go against the grain and say that I wouldn't recommend it. It has some cool concepts (expansive VR world, 80's nostalgia) but the execution is really bad IMO. It feels like an incel/neckbeard fantasy and I found myself cringing a lot. The nostalgia stuff is a cool idea but is too forced and overdone, like the author's just trying to cram as many 80's pop culture references into the story as he can."
gaming,Fuck me that's so much better
gaming,They bought them out. They did not sell their company to Epic.
gaming,"I can feel the vomit coming out me mouth already.

10/10 real immersive bus gameplay"
gaming,"I too own an Oculus. I have no problems with motion sickness, even with smooth/sliding locomotion."
gaming,Probably more like Ready Player One
gaming,"Ohmygoshyessssss I am so ready to ride the pocket rocket again! 

Yeah, I know what I just said."
gaming,PC players mad that they are getting treated the way console players have been for years. You get used to it trust me. Been dealing with exclusives since 2006. Just be thankful all you have to do is download a launcher and not buy a whole new system.
gaming,It's a shame it's going to be a game-exclusive on the intellivision Amico system next year.

gaming,get me a pizza.
gaming,"I don't trust any of the big companies to make something like Oasis. The Oasis was a rather open platform, if any of the current big conglomerates did it, it will be super locked down, with a lot of micro transactions."
gaming,"This is not the same as making a game exclusive before release

They bought a popular game and retroactively made it exclusive"
gaming,"I think stuff like VR/AR shopping will be huge. Or stuff like real estate buying. Why go to 100 houses when you can go to 1 office, put on some VR gear and walk around a virtual house that you are thinking about buying.

Being on a website is one thing, feeling like you're in the store is another. 

Think if you could walk up and down the aisle of a grocery store filling your cart, but you're really filling a digital shopping cart. You even interact with a cashier in a face to face transaction if you want.

I think in the future your day will be a weird mix between VR, AR and just plain old R. It will be so common place nobody will think it's weird. Like if you explained everybody having a smart phone to someone in the 1950's who knows what a telephone is. That's how integrated it will be in our lives."
gaming,How is it being taken advantage of? I think that when a remaster is sold it's pretty clear what it is. If you don't want to buy them then don't buy them. You seem to be making a non problem in to a problem. I'm 21 if you want to rip on my age too.
gaming,Yeah. Same here I guess. I remember the Saturn and 3DO used to have sockets like that. But it's been so long since I have seen one. Like 25ish years I think
gaming,Pretty sure they don't mean console exclusives in this case. Digital store front exclusives are pure smegma.
gaming,And to say that they’re killing competition also is wonky because this is a competitive move that benefits the devs so they keep more of their money so they can actually earn a living or have more time and motivation to make more and better content steam isn’t even close to dying there will always be steam loyalists (idk why it’s a mess to navigate and find anything) it’s business ad btw you thinking egs is going to kill all the competition? That would make them a monopoly.
gaming,"Maybe you're just rolling a bit higher than me, because 200 dollars is just wayyy too much to throw away over a gripe. That's more than enough for three brand new games on either platform. If we were talking free game vs 20 dollar game, I could understand a bit more. I already have origin and battlenet on my computer, and they collect dust until I wanna play apex or StarCraft, it's no biggie to me."
gaming,Us gamers are being oppressed!
gaming,"The idea of a mobile Diablo that is a reskin of a 4 year old game, that is being made by a third party known for their aggressive monetization of mobile games, that breaks convention set by the series by being a prequel to Diablo 3 but using ""improved"" versions of the Diablo 3 classes at a point in the story using those classes makes no sense is what bothers me."
gaming,Psy maybe. It's a pretty dumb move by Epic. No one likes to use Epic for fear of china hacking your information which is very common for the epic game launcher. The amount of people who are gonna wanna buy rocket passes through Epic game store is very low.. Also the game is old and doesn't produce that many new players.. It's the rocket pass that makes them the money now. Too bad people don't wanna spend a dime w/ Epic so it's a pretty bad move by Epic.
gaming,"has anybody here played superhot?

it’s the most innovative shooter in years"
gaming,Still canon. CHILI DOGS DID NOTHING WRONG
gaming,"I can see that being an issue with other titles, but Rocket League uses a special ID system now. All you would need is your friends Rocket ID and you could play with them. It’d work the same way cross platform play works now"
gaming,"Probably many people, but nowhere near enough to make any sort of impact."
gaming,"It was called Paragon. Some people really enjoyed it, but in the end it failed, which is ok. Epic issued refunds to all player across all platforms. They also released most of the game assets for free. They learned from that failure and went on to create the most successful game in the world.


What’s that trading cardgame steam/valve tried to make? The real crappy one with no strong points?"
gaming,Battlefront 2 is legitimately a lot of fun. Changed a lot since release and is totally worth it.
gaming,"Except they are literally working together? Now they just have Epic’s money to back them.  
 
*That’s literally a partnership* 
 
How else do you think partnerships work?"
gaming,Ok we got it. You have a gf
gaming,"You say always, but that just isn’t true. Have you read Fight Club? The movie is much better."
gaming,itll get boring quickly. but you cant complain for £7. also if you have your bank details stored on your account you can still buy days gone. itll just take whatever's missing from your psn wallet from your bank account.
gaming,"This game is perfect for the times we live in, aimless"
gaming,But you don't have to spend over $300 dollars for a new launcher. It's possible to use both.
gaming,I feel bad for the purple player :(
gaming,I'm 93.... all bets off on me
gaming,I wasn't aware it was just a reskin. That explains a lot.
gaming,I've heard the same thing being said about the book too.
gaming,How? All Ubisoft games in last few years require UPlay to be played. Buy it Steam and it will launch through UPlay. Buy it on Epic Games Store and it will lauch through UPlay. Buy it on UPlay and it will lauch through UPlay.

gaming,It’s presumptuous of you to assume the length of my lifetime lol.
gaming,"So if you already ""own"" a steam game and it becomes epic exclusive...do you still get to play the game on steam or is it gone forever?"
gaming,"...what? Since when? I've never heard it used thag way. Only ever to refer to lazy people(couch potato), low quality (sorry for the potato quality in reference to pictures on a crap phone), or an item from warframe(cant remember if its reactor. Or catalyst. Or used for both).

This is sad and I'd like it otherwise and if I were in the position to decide such things I would always prefer steam over epic. But sadly I am not.

And yes, if you boycott these games on epic this process may be reversed and it is your decision but I am not giving up borderlands 3 (just an example here) for this."

gaming,"Yeah I think that getting rid of that monopoly and more income for game devs (epic games has to offer tons of money or far less tax if they want to make an AAA title their exclusive) is more important as it can significantly reduce game prices or even increase their quality a bit (if devs use the extra money for more development).   
  
And how does the privacy part affect us? Does it matter that much?"
gaming,"Gameplay, gameplay, gameplay. I don't really care about story and graphics that much. If a game has amazing graphics, great story, but boring to play, it's just a pretty looking piece of garbage. Yes, a great story and graphics can make a good game great, but gameplay and fun should always come first. In my opinion, I don't understand how people can buy games based off the story alone. If I want to get invested in a story I'll watch a movie, read a book, watch TV or anime... not play a video game. The better graphics have gotten, more games have lost their way. Most games are trying too hard to be playable movies and I don't like it for the most part. I'm the worst hypocrite ever because I loved heavy rain though. I tend to stay away from triple a games though because most aren't original in my opinion. They just give you amazing graphics with ""epic"" storylines even though the games at their core are repetitive and boring as hell. Just my 2 cents."
gaming,Sorry boss. I'm gonna be late today. I got on THAT bus.

Edit: some people are missing the point entirely here, I'll gladly pay high amounts of money for something I see value in, like a good game or a cinema experience, but I'll not have that kind of money if I keep wasting it on things that are not worth it. 

Unless it's less than 1 buck, that's just ""fuck it, why not?"" price"
gaming,"Tencent invested 5% into reddit, which is a problem for this platform for sure, but it's nothing compared to the 48% they own of Epic, and they have two execs on the board. They have a ton more power there."
gaming,Probably too complicated for me tbh
gaming,Why is this on gaming?
gaming,"I bought a vive over a year ago. The two main problems I have are overcomplicated movements, which isn't the hardware's fault, but certain games want silly things like reloading to be ultra realistic, which means you spend 45 seconds+ reloading a gun &amp; even longer figuring out how to do it in the first place. It's not fun. And more importantly, movement/space. Houses here have small rooms &amp; movement with buttons feels unnatural or awkward a lot of the time. If they figure out a solution, we're there."

gaming,"It’s crazy to see how much VR has changed in the past few years. My friend’s brother let me use his setup when I was younger (I feel like 4-5 years ago) and I remember staying away from VR for a long time because it made my head hurt and feel weird. Last time I played a game in VR it felt disturbingly immersive and dissociative (it wasn’t even an rpg kind of thing, it was something with music and lasers)."
gaming,"320k sales on that store front means NOTHING special about that store front IF IT IS THE ONLY PLACE TO BUY IT. If it came out on steam AND the fortnite store and sold 1k copies on steam and 320k copies on the fortnite store, you'd have a point. 

If I offer a product everyone wants exclusively from a shitty shack on the side of the highway then that just means people wanted it enough to go to that shitty shack and buy it. If that product was also sold in decent stores, that shit shack would have seen NO sales."

gaming,"Mordhau, it is really fun when you can find a game."
gaming,"&gt;the idea of a mobile diablo(like) spinoff is actually pretty good

I've played some arpg games on iOS... they played like garbage. The app store has a lot of them too, and they are all cashgrabs.

The mobile screen is too small to let you be properly immersed. Even on a pad the games pale in comparison to PC. Alongside this, you don't have a keyboard/mouse, so you have tap to move, and tap to pretty much do anything. This ends up with you blocking the screen, fat fingering, etc. Additionally, this also means you input way slower compare to PC.

Aside from being downright annoying in my opinion, it also means devs have to balance the game to compensate. This leads to mobile arpgs being mind numbingly simple and easy. This means diablo immortal is going to be shallow, and a mediocre timewaster at best.

Also, they outsourced the game which means it's probably going to be even worse."

As you play more games you earn coin and other “packs.” You can use coins in the auction house to bid on players to make your team better and the packs will also allow you to get players. You can also play the computer since everyone in FUT buys coins to get the best players"
gaming,"Percentage is irrelevant if the userbase is literally hundreds of thousands to millions of users. Furthermore, STEAM does not accurately represent the userbase for a whole lot of reasons:

1. It does not track a user that logs into Windows AND Linux separately.
2. It does not track multiple users logging into the same machine.
3. It does not track a user logging into multiple Windows or Linux systems at the same geographical location.
4. It does not track users that have switched FROM Windows TO Linux.

And more scenarios.

The stats do not represent the truth. But the fact remains, [there is enough money to be made for there to be literally thousands of games sold on STEAM for Linux](https://store.steampowered.com/linux), in addition to the fact Blizzard has been quietly fixing Linux issues for their games for literally decades (World of Warcraft and other games).

If VALVe didn't see economic value in supporting Linux, do you think they would have spent literally years releasing SteamOS, STEAM for Linux, their entire game (and engine) catalogue native for Linux, STEAM Index for Linux (the new VR kit), and rolled out Steam Play which enables Windows-only games to run on Linux?

You're willfully ignoring that it makes monetary sense for many, many, developers to release on Linux. There's even articles and interviews out there where developers publicly say that releasing their game on Linux ended up making them more money than they thought.

**But even still, you're missing the point**. I'm talking about **words that Epic themselves have said publicly, and kept on their website, since 2014, about them officially supporting Linux**. The Engine keeps receiving updates for Linux, but it most certainly is not the ""First class citizen"" the linked article said they would make it.

You're operating on very stale info friend, Gaming on Linux _IS_ profitable. Market trends prove this in so many ways you're just unwilling to even acknowledge."

gaming,"They've been announcing the death of PC gaming since the late 80s. The closest PC gaming came to dying was in the 2004 - 2010 era, as that was just a terrible time all around for PC.  Expensive hardware, awful ports, and all big publishers desperatly trying to push PC away, using it as a scape goat for poor performance etc(""everyone just pirates!""). 



Pc gaming has been steadily rising since about 2010, just getting more and more popular. It now rivals any one console (Hell arguably it rivals all consoles combined if we go by active users vs sales, which is flawed for many reasons).  Will streamikg take over and become the primary way of playing games? Most likely.  Will it do so in the next few years? Unlikely.  



I also see it as unlikely it'll happen in the next decade. The earning potentional of a streaming service vs current model is just too  different.  In grand scheme of things, too few people have access to fiber, and so will have unplayable experience.  High speed coax cable causes too much data/package loss to be reliable for gaming, especially fast paced shooters and the like."

gaming,"Not everybody gets motion sickness in VR, and for those that do, most find that you can overcome it by acclimating yourself (ie taking off the headset when you start to feel sick, and putting it back on once you feel better). Your brain gets used to it, the same way that people who spend time on boats eventually get ""sea legs"" and no longer get seasick. Once you get your VR legs, joystick/touchpad locomotion isn't a problem.

Teleportation as a movement mechanic was the norm for games a few years ago, but is increasingly being relegated to a secondary option or phased out entirely as game devs realize more people want joystick/touchpad locomotion."

gaming,"Console exclusives vs pc storefront exclusives are different beasts. I think he's referring to PC exclusives being ""cancer"" because there is zero point and most people on PC are massively established on steam and don't like seeing fortnite co. buy up rights and take the ability to purchase on steam away from us.

Console exclusives make sense at least because there's a competition to sell consoles. Yes there is competition to sell games on a digital marketplace, too but PC gamers have always had a choice of where they want to buy it for the most part. This company cashes in royally on the flossing youth, snorts a line of coke, throws up a shoddy looking store that didn't even have a search, and starts throwing money around to take away our choice.

I know and trust steam. I have had zero issues with them for 15 years and my steam library is my biggest collection of anything. inb4 ""you can still buy it and play it though"" well it's my choice to not condone business practices I don't agree with and it's my choice to add to more games to my gigantic library."

gaming,"&gt; It's not like they are going to transfer the playerbase from steam to epic store...

I actually think you're mistaken here. I think there must be a plan for this. You make valid points that Rocket League is not a game with a huge tail end remaining on its sales curve. Therefore the game's playerbase and attractiveness to the demographics in Epic's ecosystem (primarily console players dabbling in PC, and young teenage fortnite players that many 20+ gamers cringe at) are really its two big selling points for a massive acquisition.

It may be a bit tin-foil hat-ish to say this but someone floated this on /r/rocketleague before I did: there may be plans after Steam sale is halted to update the game to require the Epic launcher, and force people into the ecosystem that way. Seeing how well all their other attempts at market share expansion have been met, that would go over immeasurably poorly."

gaming,Can we get this on Xbox please?
gaming,"I suppose how I feel is that Steam is simply easier for me, and also ultimately gets any small game company more money. 

The reason Steam is easier for me is because it’s a nice convenient way to store my digital games. I also don’t really enjoy using poorly optimized knock-off versions of Steam, and having to waste my computer’s memory on those. (I don’t know if the Epic Games Store is poorly optimized, since I don’t have it, but I would assume that it is considering every other one like it is) 

The reason I think Steam is better for small game companies isn’t because despite the fact that on a “knock-off version of Steam” they would earn more money per purchase, people are much, and I mean **much**, less likely to purchase their game, overall earning them less.

Honestly I just feel that it’s negative for everyone involved, except for Epic Games Store."
gaming,Remote control laser pointer
gaming,I feel VR today is still very different than what we saw in Ready Player One
gaming,Can it play Skyrim?
gaming,"""Mountain breaks the mold of video games""

Honestly, I think it's more like a high-fidelity screensaver than a video game. If I understand it right, you do absolutely nothing, just watch a mountain rotate and have random developments happen. I don't hate it by any means, but I feel like it's in the wrong category, and that makes it seem revolutionary (That was meant to be a pun on revolution=turning, but it kinda blends in too much)

&amp;#x200B;

Like, imagine I made a movie, but I don't want to be bound by Hollywood conventions. Instead of fancy CGI, it's a 20th century 2D animation. Also, black and white. And instead of sound, it's got text subtitles for that old timey silent movie feel. In fact, let's do away with the 'motion' in motion picture altogether. Just still frames. In fact, we're breaking a mold here, let's take out the 'picture' as well. Now it's just text on the screen. What I've made isn't a free spirited, unrestrained, deeply artistic movie, what I've made is called a book, and projecting a book on a screen isn't a big deal.

Edit: three words"

gaming,Everyone the fuck else wtf
gaming,Thats why fornite should be more popular as it's still on a hype train while Minecraft's one ended in 2014. So fornite not passing Minecraft shows that Minecraft is much more popular
gaming,"Epic just bought the studio that makes it, it's not official yet but was heavily implied to be moving off steam in the near future."
gaming,Days gone is alright but it ain't full price alright. It's just painfully average and is better gotten when it's cheaper as it's ubisoft lite approach to games design.

gaming,"Cause children just love freaky unrecognizable monsters doing stuff they won't understand to 1990's Jim Carey jokes, I hear its all the rage, Sonic is like Fortnite on crack.   Yeah, no, while its a kids movie, its aware that mostly its a kids movie because the PARENTS will care about Sonic and bring their kids, but they won't care about this one.    The kids themselves aren't gonna be begging to go see Sonic the Hedgehog."

gaming,The best amount of walmarts to go to is zero.
gaming,That’s not very nice. But I guess you knew that.
gaming,"Games will be sweet, but I think a lot of people are also missing out on the idea of virtual tourism.

Maybe in the future, you'll be able to strap yourself into your VR gear and rent a drone somewhere for a period of time that's co-piloted by the company's owner. You could explore underwater wrecks, take a look at the pyramids in Giza or even take a flying tour of a rainforest in South America.

These sorts of ideas would also help bridge the gap between people all over the world and make social issues more relevant for everyone across the globe. If you saw the rainforest being logged or burned down in real time through your VR headset, you might be more inclined to take environmental issues about it a bit more seriously. 

I think the biggest hurdle for all this is internet infrastructure itself and what it can currently handle. The VR stuff is probably the easiest. But how do you deliver that sort of engagement to anyone anywhere in the world with so many different standards of internet quality?"

gaming,"I actually agree with you. I never played rdr2, but I only played skyrim for a few hours and gave up. I felt like it was trying too hard, but hey that's what the majority of people want and sales don't lie which is why I'm starting to give up on the gaming industry. I have never played nor have the desire to play assassins creed, god of war, last of us, bioshock. I love metal gear, but that's about as deep as I went. I got bored with skyrim, I thought fallout was pretty cool actually, I got bored with horizon zero dawn, destiny got repetitive, borderlands 2 was amazing, GTAV was a lot of fun. Honestly the games I have been playing the most recently are soul calibur VI, megaman legacy collection, hotline Miami 2, wipeout omega collection and titanfall 2."

gaming,"I see many of your points, I was simply generalizing that the current market is rapidly changing, and there seems to be less demand for “traditional” A list games and cost models as the market moves to multiplayer and micro transactions.  I used Fortnite as the embodiment of these things.

I guess I oversimplified because didn’t plan to debate markets here as the point of the top post was to blame a company’s struggles on the announcement of a game that the OP (and many others) disapprove of rather than real business related reasons.  Makes them feel better.

The real anger should be at the mindless automotons who buy those games and force reputable developers to pump them out to stay alive.  But blaming “evil big money grubbing corporations” is trendier."

gaming,"Praying that my ps2 will load up NFS: Underground  on the first try, this hit me right in the nostalgias."
gaming,"I'll go against what seems to be the general consensus and say not really. For a book set in a dystopian sci-fi future, it's just way too obsessed with the eighties, which did not resonate with me at all as a reader who did not grow up in them.

The book itself is a bunch of lazy VR gaming wish fulfillment fantasy interspersed with challenges revolving around eighties pop culture that the MC resolves by being ridiculously obsessed with the eighties. One scene involves him literally repeating word for word every line of a character of an entire movie. And he gets it on the first try. I wish I was kidding.

The story is unimaginative, the bad guys are a generic evil corporation with no character, the main character is 80's trivia Mary Sue in a world contrived to reward this, the romance subplot is horribly trite, and the book treats the reader as a moron who must regularly be tossed some gratuitous bit of 80's pop culture nostalgia to make them go ""Oh hey I get that!"" and distract them from how mediocre the actual product is."

gaming,"Nintendo has always had a game play first, story and other stuff later approach to game design. So if the Zelda time-line looks tacked on its because it's exactly that. Nintendo focused on making the Zelda series good games and then for the most part made a story that ties them all together later on."
gaming,"For some reason, when I first saw this, I immediately saw the front windows as two monitors side by side, so my brain decided this was one of those crazy gaming simulator rigs on hydraulics. Then it had to make sense of the top mirror as a small dedicated display, the side display, and the bus frame as the room background with hue sync. As I went through this thought process, I became more and more amazed by how sophisticated this setup was... for a bus simulator? Took a couple of loops before I snapped back to seeing it normally."

gaming,"Literally them purchasing a title for exclusive release on their platform is them getting a monopoly for that title. Epic is just creating a different monopoly, not tearing one down."
gaming,"I mean it’s easy to just blame the companies and the people steering it, and they deserve their blame.

The reality is, there’s a market for it sadly."
gaming,"Ooh that's rough. I think my compulsion to save every 5 minutes began with Pokemon Blue. The Gameboy Pocket had a light that would turn on when you're battery was low but if you didn't have any extra AAA batteries with you (which was common in my house because no one could ever find batteries when needed), you had to either turn it off or take your chances based on how long you think you have left. So if you're on a long car ride with nothing else to do, you take your chances and just save constantly. 

I actually enjoy playing games that only use autosave because it is nice not having that nagging thought all the time that I need to do a manual save."
gaming,I believe he’s referring to epic buying the company behind rocket league.
gaming,"For some stuff sure, but not cars and houses. People still want to sit in the car and feel how the buttons press, how the seats adjust, how the speakers sound with the windows open, and other stuff like that you can't quite simulate. Same goes for houses, you want to see how the neighborhood really sounds, you want to get up close and see the details of the counters, see how the rooms actually feel when you walk around in them....

Big-ticket stuff is going to require in-person visits for a long time yet, I think."
gaming,"Wouldn't say it's a minority by any means.

Given Epic Games' *atrocious* track record so far, there can't really be much good coming of it."
gaming,"1. Yes. You will be able to catch the other starters in the wild.
2. There are some differences in the games. For example Sun takes place in the day and Moon at night, and ruby has Groupon and Sapphire has Kyogre"

Lots of people don't have a reason for this to effect them and that's fine. Lots of people do have reasons to be against this at the same time. Like it? Use it. Don't like it? Don't. Comment wars aren't going to decide the outcome, sales will."
gaming,"Yeah, but just imagine a friend's reaction when they open the cupboard to see this."
gaming,"&gt; 320k sales on that store front means NOTHING special about that store front IF IT IS THE ONLY PLACE TO BUY IT. If it came out on steam AND the fortnite store and sold 1k copies on steam and 320k copies on the fortnite store, you'd have a point.
&gt; 
&gt; If I offer a product everyone wants exclusively from a shitty shack on the side of the highway then that just means people wanted it enough to go to that shitty shack and buy it. If that product was also sold in decent stores, that shit shack would have seen NO sales.

It absolutely does mean something. I'm sorry if you're ignorant to understand that, but 320k sales for any title is massive. No matter what stupid fucking thing you want to think EGS is, ""unpopular"" is not one of them. 320,000 people found it *popular* enough to buy at least one title on it."

gaming,"Tetris is now a $700 game. This logic is flawed.

EDIT: play time should barely factor in. The Last of Us gives you 7 hours of amazing story and gameplay, and cost $60. Tetris gives you hundreds of hours of solid gameplay, and cost you a dollar. It's about the work that went into it, and what the experience is worth. I can make a Tetris clone in an afternoon; I can't make TLOU no matter show hard I tried."

gaming,"Different strokes for different folks, man.  

Also, you've effectively asked ""if you remove all of Nintendo's games, what do they have to offer that Sony and MS don't?""

They keep a closed loop ecosystem for their first party games because it allows them to craft high quality experiences that fans enjoy.  You may not enjoy them, and that's fine, but there are millions and millions of gamers out there who don't like FPS games, or love the way the first party stuff is designed or plays etc."
gaming,"&gt;I'm gonna give this one attempt to make you understand.
&gt;
&gt;Imagine a game comes out on the ps4, and ONLY the ps4, this game is so fucking amazing that loads of people want to buy it and play it. Unfortunately for those without a ps4, they can't do that unless they get a ps4. So in order to play this game, they buy a ps4. They didn't buy the ps4 because they like the ps4, they didn't buy the ps4 because they want the ps4, they bought it, because they want this one game.
&gt;
&gt;Buying the ps4 for this one game, doesn't mean they like the ps4, or that they think it is good, it means it is LITERALLY the only option. Being the only option doesn't mean you are popular, to be popular there has to be a choice, the user has to choose you over someone else, if you are the only choice, they don't choose you because they like you or think you are amazing, it's because they can't do anything else.
&gt;
&gt;Popularity requires the user to wilfully choose you over another option. If Metro was also sold on steam, and the epic store ended up selling more copies than steam, that would mean they are more popular than steam, being forced to pick a certain option because there is no choice, makes people hate you, not like you. Especially when your product is worse than the competitors in terms of features and security.
&gt;
&gt;Also, 320,000 is not a lot. Not in a market this big.

gaming,Into the Spiderverse got 97/94% on rotten tomatoes. Most people loved it. I did!
gaming,VR R&amp;D usually includes AR R&amp;D and vice versa. Many different research fields overlap and the true goal of both technologies is to combine into one 'XR' device which is a hybrid of both.
gaming,&gt; I tried telling my wide
gaming,"&gt; No.
&gt; 
&gt; Which is why I don't think this statement is anything more than marketing double speak.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll believe it means anything when they release some numbers.

Who do you think they're ""marketing"" to, exactly?...

There is no reason to lie about this basic information, especially when the devs would simply say it's not true if it wasn't true."
gaming,"But gamedevs aren’t idiots. They get an offer from Epic Games and they can think if that’s worth it.  
  
I can even argue that as Steam has probably 10-30 games posted every day and Epic Game has like 50 games despite having tons of accounts, then the indie games may even get more attention on Epic Games. Steam doesn’t just offer everybody 1000 games a day so they sell. But on Epic Store you can easily see literally every single game.  
  
I mean I don’t really use any of those stores but the more I think about it the more it appears that Epic is better for both AAA and indie games which would otherwise get barely noticed on Steam.  
  
If you don’t agree then please tell me how do you find games and decide to buy them."
gaming,We need this with Battle Royale
gaming,I can’t think of one thing epic has done that I enjoy.
gaming,What is there to do in Skyrim that you haven't already done in the 8 years it's been out?
gaming,"It doesn’t matter what ‘point’ they’re making, sonic looks like utter shit. They can make all the ‘points’ they want, but so can we"
gaming,It's the Harry Potter Knight Bus simulator! =)
gaming,"It looks better but let's be real, everyone would still be throwing a shit fit even if he looked this way."
gaming,Plastic bag from dollar general lol.
gaming,"If you haven't played omni-bus, go do yourself a favor and get that gem."
gaming,Why didn't you like Into the Spiderverse?
gaming,I've seen it done 3D without the wall being obstructive
gaming,"""Well then here dear, give it a try. Long... Live... The King..."""
gaming,That was the plot of the book/movie.  It was free and accessible for all but the main villain wanted control of it to fill it with micro transactions.
gaming,"I give it a nine. point. nine. five.

gaming,"&gt; Uuh, are you being dense on purpose?. i'm not going to waste my time arguing with a shill.
&gt;
&gt;Ok nvm, you are clearly a troll, good luck with your life.

Cool, so I'm a troll *and* a shill, because apparently you think *80 players* is somehow indicative of a 320,000+ copy game being sold primarily on steam."
gaming,The greatest game since Goat Simulator.
gaming,"You mean ""I’ll seize *our* means of P R O D U C T I O N"""
gaming,"how do you keep track of where your bus is? In snake you have a top down view, doing that in first person seems confusing."
gaming,Can I play this? Like ... now?
gaming,Matt is the final boss of Wii Sports Boxing and Wii Sports Resort Swordplay. He is known to be extremely hard. He looks like [this](https://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/w__/images/5/57/MattDACot.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20170506215444&amp;path-prefix=wiisports)
gaming,"Right looks much better but I’ll still watch the movie, I’m in love with the Jim carrey eggman hahah"
gaming,I’m aware. Not a fan of marvel movies.
gaming,"&gt; Okay, you obviously don’t understand the concept of exclusive monopoly vs. popularity, so I’m just gonna stop wasting my time.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_application

Educate yourself."
gaming,"At this point, the movie is likely to bomb for more reasons than just Sonic looking terrible. And the money it would cost to re-do Sonic - effectively requiring every character shot in the movie to be re-done through the whole pipeline again - is certainly more than the money they'd gain by making him look somewhat better."
gaming,"This is going to get down voted to hell but...






ePiC bAd"
gaming,Holy shit it does.. kind of terrifying but cool. Then again i don't think Sonic ever had sharp teeth.
gaming,"&gt; 2) was reported as part of the first few exclusivity deals

And where's the source?"
gaming,Exactly what I thought. They could have made Dragon Ball work but they fucked it. They could have made Sonic work as well but they went the Enchanted route for some fucking reason. Why do movie exec's have to screw things up so badly?
gaming,They rely too heavily on their exclusives though. So much so that there's barely anything original in their new titles
gaming,"To be honest I think Jim Carrey might actually be pretty good in this, the rest of the movie... Not so much"
gaming,Climate change and Automation.
gaming,Is that Andromeda? Been wanting to give a another shot but not sure if they fixed it a bit since release cus it was kinda bad lol
gaming,Anyone else get the distinct feeling these comments are being astroturfed? There's tons of unsubstantial but positive comments that barely even seem to he able the actual game...
gaming,"I really wish they would reboot these into a tv series or movie franchise. With better writing, today’s cgi and an R rating I feel like they’d be awesome."
gaming,This is how I imagined public transit when I lived in Western Nebraska.
gaming,Marvel writing is too cringy for me. Can’t get into anything they make.
gaming,That’s fine but can I equip for example a shot gun and an AR and swap them with a quick select like the directional pad or is it a button to open the wheel and point with the stick which weapon you want?
gaming,It's surprising how anyone allowed the real eyes to happen.
gaming, I’m sure someone is adding up how much money it would cost to do that versus how much money they will lose if they release it in this state.
gaming,Lies! Base game still entices me. I guess I'm in love with the classic :)
gaming,"I mean, Sonic's world has humans, military and all that, so I wouldn't be surprised if this is sonic's world.

But then again, talking animals seems unusual to them."
gaming,"I haven’t been playing it for 8 years, I haven’t even played it for 10 full hours yet.

The gaming world doesn’t just have l33t g@m3rz in it, I’m a working professional who doesn’t buy games the minute they come out because I haven’t even finished playing the last 5 games I bought.

The idea of playing it wherever I happen to be without lugging a full console around is very appealing."
gaming,"&gt;But every game in existence jumped ship to steam willingly and now they wanna act like steam is bad and epic is good.

I don't know if they necessarily think epic games is good. They were probably just paid a fuckton of money to make their games exclusive, which epic games got from the fortnite kiddies.

Rocket league is also years old now. They probably had quite a few sales this year, but I assume epic games is loaded and were able to convince them to take the potential hit in sales."
gaming,"Yes, after we finish porting the game to XB1 and PS4 we'll focus on a VR port. It was one of the Kickstarter stretch goals we had back in 2017, really looking forward to getting it in VR too!"
gaming,Radio Los Santos - GTA 5/GTA: San Andreas
gaming,I could agree on that
gaming,"Some day someone will release a game exclusive to brick and mortar stores like Walmart, Best Buy, Target, etc. without requiring Steam, Epic, etc.   :)"
gaming,"Bus: long     
Passengers: flying     
Streets: violent     
Yee: haw"
gaming,Fucking bicep bro is the best part of this whole image.
gaming,YO WHAT CITY DO YOU LIVE IN? Hesperia Walmarts sure as hell don't get that luxury.
gaming,I still hate this new look
gaming,What great mind thought of this
gaming,"Oh shit, another thing I could add, accident"
gaming,"I just finished the tutorial for Scythe. It looks to be fun, like a more advanced Settlers of Catan with Mechs ha."
gaming,"Spiderverse is massively overrated. The visuals were unique, and it was genuinely one of the funniest animated films I’ve ever seen. 

But damn, people out there acting like it’s the greatest thing ever and it deserved to be nominated for Best Picture. Did I watch the same movie??? lol"
gaming,"Well absolutely stylization over all. But if they can do face like this this well, then we can have stylized versions of our own faces just as easily. 

Personally I'd like it to be my own face, apart from all the government/corporate tracking that it would be abused by. (Let's be honest if they can map out our face to put on a character they already have what they need)"
gaming,"Here's my prediction, we're going to see as much of Carrey looking like this in the movie as we did in the trailer."
gaming,"Andromeda is hot garbage. I think this is ME2, or the Omega DLC in ME3"
gaming,I used a lazer engraver
gaming,For real. Especially with the stories in the games anymore. Mortal kombat legacy on YouTube was solid. Should check it out.
gaming,I think it was more that there were already problems throughout society and the Oasis was a way of ignoring those problems. It didn't cause them but it didn't fix them either.
gaming,Honestly they have escape rooms and houses. Why not have have a whole house scan and recreate it for like a 3D zombie game?
gaming,"I'm against Epic as well but I'm with you. I don't like epic buying exclusives cause I like and trust Steam and have a LOT of games on steam. My steam collection is my largest collection and if i'm going to spend money on this hobby i'd like to keep the library as intact as possible. I'm not expecting anybody to give a shit about my reason, but at the same time i'm not pretending to be a business analyst like 90% of the people on here.

I'm just a consumer and I want what's best for me. I don't give two shits what this means for Psyonic's projected earnings. But I do know that anything in store for Rocket League's future will not be on Steam and I won't die if I don't play it so I probably just won't."
gaming,"For the movie at this point? Waaaay past too late. 

They should've done it during design / concept stages. But then again, it's the director decision."
gaming,What the hell this game is
gaming,To me that really does look so much better.
gaming,Can I ask how much $ it will be on Steam?
gaming,"That's fair. Did you enjoy the darker tones in the DC movies, pre-Justice League?"
gaming,Whenever I go to Walmart I'm lucky if they have someone even remotely competent in charge of the electronics department. The last time I went in they had some 60 something year old lady as the only person there who not only seemed to be dying in front of me barely even knew what a controller was.
gaming,"No those types of movies still exist and are still being made, they just aren't being made based on Sonic."
gaming,"I actually think AR will come through our phones first before we see widespread adoption of glasses. We'll open the app up the camera lens and screen will act as our augmented portal, and we'll see it through that while we're holding our phone up.

It'll be simple stuff at first, like google map directions will show a Tron-like line going down the sidewalk to your destination, or something like a ""Smart City App"" where you can point your phone at a restaurant and it will show you their menu and specials, or at the movie theater to get showtimes.

After that kind of stuff gets really popular, people will start being more open to the glasses, I think."
gaming,Have you upgraded your ship at all?
gaming,Until Epic buys them
gaming,"My wife who i adored so much just divorced me so I'm spending my extra money on games now I guess ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . Played it for half an hour and was saddened by how emotional the Mountain felt, just like me when my wife... left... me... ;(. Anyways, good game the quality of it definitely justifies its price tag (like it isn't cheap already)

&amp;#x200B;

\-A review of the game by steam user  [R3START!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/313340/Mountain/)"
gaming,"I agree. I found the new, individual Gwent game to be great, just not as good! It’s not the same as Trecking around the world collecting all the best cards ;) 
Oh and that gwent tournament in Witcher? So intensely hard!"
gaming,How did they not test these things in the first place?
gaming,"Steam released Sep. 2003. Let's give Epic a 16 year try. 

Not saying either is better but Steam wasnt perfect when it started."
gaming,It was also from sword art online
gaming,"If you don't like nintendo just say that you don't like them, no need to go to the extent to say that they are a shitty company just because you don't like their titles. Everyone is entitled their own opinion, but don't go around stating your own 'facts' when it's very apparent that the Switch is selling well and clearly doesn't justify your point whereby Nintendo is a shitty company."
gaming,"I disagree, but you're welcome to your opinion.  Just don't buy 'em.  Others will."
gaming,"yes think so, since the legendary edition on disk is basically just a redeem code, it should be saved on your account."
gaming,"My first though during the gun range was what happens if you put the gun to your head. 

Hmmm"
gaming,Those who take care of their great responsibility and those who shit all over their great responsibility.
gaming,"Splatoon, Smash Series, Xenoblade, Octopath Traveler, Arms, The world ends with you, Kirby is actually really surprising, Super Monkey Ball on GameCube is fun, Okamiden on DS, Kid Icarus Uprising is Really good, Pikmin series, etc. Just because They're rated E for everyone doesn't make a game bad, and graphics aren't everything. Nintendo doesn't make consoles with the graphics level of others because they don't *Need* it to make a game look amazing."
gaming,"No, this is just a fan edit. The trailers are done which means the movie is largely done. Someone somewhere made the decision to make sonic look like this and now he edit: (she? they?) has to live with it."
gaming,"1. Ruby was a fine choice, people rave about gen 5 but I never played it, basically at this point you can get whatever and still get a good well rounded experience. 
2. No, the are sometimes passing references but good and silver were the only ones to involve a second region. Pokemon from older generations will show up frequently in the newer versions though, keep moving forward and hope for remakes. 
3. What you pick as your starter is what you're stuck with. 
4. Different versions have slightly different stories, sun and moon are twelve hours apart for day/night effects and will have different region specific pokemon in them, ultra versions aren't much different, they just had a longer story. 
5. Not really, you can make a well rounded team without them but for the first few gyms they're your powerhouse. 
6. I usually just keep them for my pokedex and to be hm slaves. 
7. It is true they are OP, but if you don't train others around them you can run into real trouble.
8. Catch anything you haven't found yet for sure, look up move sets and build a team around what suits your needs."
gaming,Sorry everyone else in this thread. I gave it a shot too. This fucker is hopeless.
gaming,This in VR and my mind would implode.
gaming,Every day is one step closer to becoming one with the machines.
gaming,"Like
Sonic but red? And with big pointy knuckles?"
gaming,"There is one for the Wii thats great, ir has several games but the lightcycles was the best. You could both make 90 degrees turns or drive like in any other game.

Edit: The game's called ""Tron: Battle Grids"""
gaming,"How so? We have all the technology today, just at an earlier stage. I would expect it to be achieved in 10 years. The OASIS itself, being a massive universe, could take longer. But I'll be pretty happy playing a VRMMO anyway."
gaming,Buses have rear view mirrors so the driver can watch the passengers. Source: I ride buses and get watched by buy drivers
gaming,They want that Disney money
gaming,I’m no expert but Randy said offline play
gaming,Yes it is :)
gaming,"Best of luck to you brother. 

Text based RP reinvigorated so many things for me but if it’s not right for you than I hope the best."
gaming,"You're definitely right. However, if they marketing toward   the youngest generation, will it matter if his appearance gets changed?"
gaming,Her skin is like that... just because she’s Latino doesn’t mean she’s dark.
gaming,"Warframe? If you plan to invest time there is a lot to learn and a ton of fun and customization to be had. Avail on PC, xbox, ps4, and switch. Hmu if you wanna get started on PC?"
gaming,Man if only I knew what to let Siri eavesdrop on so that these targeted ads show up on my feed...
gaming,"Epic has since clarified that it didn't make definitive plans to remove *Rocket League* from Steam. ""Long-term plans will be announced in the future,"" according to an Epic spokesperson. We've updated the article accordingly. This doesn't guarantee that *Rocket League*will remain on Steam indefinitely -- just that Epic hasn't confirmed plans one way or the other."
gaming,I think this will still keep doing this till fortnite stops making huge amounts of money.. Doesn't make any sense to remove the game from steam as it's been on here since 2015. All the player base has already been built up.
gaming,I see what about split screen
gaming,It's probably intended for Jim Boonie only.
gaming,Makes me want to try Silver/Crystal again. Although I have to crack them open and swap batteries.
gaming,What the holy motherland. Good for you my dedicated friend!
gaming,"What surprise me is the director came from Blur Studio. 

Considering the talent they have in the past year, he should've known better about character design when he took place to direct this movie. SMH"
gaming,Meanwhile I wouldn't even want to play a game that would take at least 60 hours to complete (with a few exceptions).
gaming,"I compare it to other things. I'd spend the equivalent of $20-$30 going to a movie, so I'll spend that on a game I can get 2-3 hours entertainment out of"
gaming,"New models can play SNES games but the plain models cannot unfortunately, that being said, it’s 100% worth it to get a new model, alongside SNES games being playable you have a new little bun thingy, faster loading times, better 3D eye tracking so your eyes never get bothered much compared to the OG, and there’s more features I believe but I can’t remember off the top of my head, I’d recommend a straight comparison video on YouTube, also, New 2DS XL is a good and cheap substitution for the new 3DS XL if you don’t care about 3D."
gaming,It's also from the movie called Stay Alive
gaming,Exactly what I thought as I read it!
gaming,What a stupid yet epic idea.  Take my money
gaming,What if I'm 90?
gaming,How do you collect passengers?
gaming,"Thank you! I just mean its a bit art heavy/focused, in addition to being an exploration-puzzle game :)"
gaming,take my horse to the old town road
gaming,YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH
gaming,I was really hoping I didn't need to use the /s but I overestimated.
gaming,I loved DC even though everyone hated it. I actually prefer zero jokes in my superhero movies.

gaming,Ya'll might have liked Tonka Construction but Tonka Raceway was MY jam. Nothing could beat out that PC game in my childhood eyes.
gaming,"it’s a shame the index costs $1,000. the rift s is a much better deal from what i’ve seen so far"
gaming,Meetup is how I met my local boardgame group!
gaming,"I never really get the play time thing, I’d rather pay $60 for 8 hours of an incredibly refined game than 60 hours of...meh. From my experience any game that pushes 60 hours has awful filler. Unless you’re talking online multiplayer. Single player games that push 20hours get a bit much for me. Just wrapping up Sekiro at about 45 hours and although it’s amazing there were definitely times I was thinking ‘ok let’s wrap this up soon’. But to be fair I have less and less time for games as I get older and appreciate the short ones."
gaming,"Do you really not see any difference between a monopoly for a title and a monopoly for the market? Steam didn’t have any significant competitors until now. That’s how Epic tears down that monopoly.  
  
Now starts a competition between those two. Steam can’t lose all of it’s customers in 3-4 years but over tome they may need to think about offers they make to gamedevs. Right now developers get lots of money from epic. Then as it gets more competitive they will get even more money. I can’t say it any easier sorry."
gaming,"Hhhhhhhj... One one hand I loved earthworm Jim, on the other hand, the original cartoonist /(Doug TenNapel) is both an absolutely brilliant artist and an awful person spewing hate speech through Breitbart and stuff... Breaks my heart but I don't think I can go other some of the awful things he said and thinks. Can't support that guy's career."
gaming,Jesus...can't you give him two big cartoon eyes *without* them being attached?
gaming,"I’d bet he does, he took my gameboy and everything but none of the teachers believed me because he was a “good kid”😂 ahh good times

Edit: bet not bed"
gaming,"&gt;  Your body can feel things like shape, texture (smooth vs. rough), temperature, sharpness, airflow and acceleration.

The HaptX gloves can simulate most of these, and it has left the lab. It's being used in enterprise right now."
gaming,"But you've done all that after the technological advancements of recording and cinema have taken place. So you're taking a deliberate choice, which you have to defend of course but the fact that you took that decision makes it something *more* (in a conceptual sense) and not fundamentally *lesser* or of lower quality, as it seems you're describing now."
gaming,DAE not hate epic? Epic sucks so it's only fair to talk about them every thread until they stop stealing ideas in their games
gaming,"1.) Start with Red, Blue, and Yellow.

2.) Yes and No it depends on the game

3.) Yes but only by trading with another person (or yourself if you have the option)

4.) They have different pokemon

5.) No, if you don't want to catch them all. Yes if you do.

6.) Put them in storage or slowly level them up by switching in and out until they evolve or get better moves.

7.) They can be but depends on what type of pokemon you are fighting. And yes you should level up other pokemon.

8) All pokemon are worth it. The main point is to catch them all."
gaming,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t he from the planet Mobius? I remember that being used in the theme song and the comic."
gaming,This reminded me of old demoscene shit for some reason.

gaming,I think I was high

gaming,"I sware if they fuck up rocket league I'm done.. it's the only fucking game I play.. fucking Epic dont mess with my shit, it's all I got.."
gaming,"Well yeah,  Believe it or not they exist solely to make money. Its kind of the point."
gaming,"But aren't people who already own it on steam still gonna be able to play it?
Also from psyonix's side this makes sense since they use unreal engine to make their game."
gaming,"You know what could improve a lot of lives without needing to wait decades for VR tech to improve and become affordable enough for people without access to get it and use it? Investing responsibly in better teachers.

gaming," The youngest generation didn’t grow up with sonic. I’m sure they are looking at the comic book demographic to really help them out here, so males ages 17 to 35. I’m sure it’s going to make some money but I do not think it is going to be breaking even."
gaming,3D Banana Chucking Gorillaz
gaming,"The visuals were way more than unique dude, the visuals were absolutely stunning. And you say it's one of the funniest animated films you've ever seen.

gaming,no cause i'm Canadian.

gaming,I'm sure they'll do just fine without you
gaming,I'm pretty sure you will like Sonic
gaming,"1. My personal favorite is Generation 2, so that's the Gold, Silver and Crystal games. The first Pokemon game I played was Fire Red, which is just a remake of the original Red. 

2. I know that gen 1 Pokemon appear in gen 2, so I'd assume that trend continued to the new games 

3. In the older games you can't find the other starters in the wild, not sure about newer games though (I haven't played them lol)

4. Gold and Crystal have certain exclusive Pokémon , and Crystal has its story tweaked a little bit to add some playtime. For the most part, pairs (or trios) of games are all pretty similar 

5. Starters matter to an extent. You don't have to use them, but they're pretty decent Pokemon you can get really easily (duh)

6. Some of these seemingly useless Pokemon are actually useful, like Magikarp, but sometimes even after they evolve their not very good. I'm personally a big fan of butterfree, even though I know it's not too great of a Pokemon lol 

7. It's pretty hard to properly level up your Pokemon if you're first starting to play, and you're starter will feel OP for a while if you only level him. Eventually you'll run into something that counters him... probably... 

8. An easy way to see if a Pokemon is strong is just to look it up online. ""base stats"" are a good indication of a hoe strong a Pokemon is. Pokemon like dragonite have really high base stats, and others like caterpie have really low base stats (dragonite is the strong one here just in case). 

If you have any other questions about the older games, feel free to ask. I can't help too much with the newer games since I haven't played them though. 

Anyway, hope I answered all your questions!"

gaming,"Definitely! I'm doing basically all the quests I can and just enjoying the hell out of it. I'm at like.... 22% though the story? In chapter 2, just don't want to say too much in case of spoilers. Really good though. Managed to get the Ultimate Edition when it was on sale for $60, so I feel like I cheated a little in the early game.

gaming,"At the end of the day its an EXCLUSIVE. The way consoles had it for years. Sometimes you get lucky and the franchise you like goes multiplat (Deadrising series) but any series can go exclusive. All it takes is money, and thats exactly what epic is doing. Lets be honest. We all sit here and hate the EGS but im willing to bet most of the people who complain about it have it installed on their computers. Because when you sit and think about it, is not being able to have fun playing video games worth the boycott? Such a petty thing to be upset about. It doesnt change the fundamentals of the game at all, its just attached to a new and dumbed down launcher lol thats it."

gaming,"Epic bought Psyonix. It will still be available on Steam until late 2019, after which it will be moved to the Epic Games Store. This is bad for two main reasons. A: Epic Games Store is missing many features steam has and is generally a poorer experience. B: No Linux Support.

gaming,"I was kind of wondering is using 'bulbapedia' or guides was bad, but it seems like everyone thinks it is good.

I do have another question, how do the different versions work? I don't mean sun/moon, I mean the seemingly unofficial ones like Jupiter and dark violet. Are they worth playing?

also, is it worth playing the remakes of red blue and yellow?"
gaming,"Yeah your gonna have to lock those up, I worry about kicking and hitting my cats when playing but they tend to look out for themselves."
gaming,Absolutely yes. I often wonder if I am losing more interest in games because I'm getting older or if it's because I feel most games don't have heart anymore. Maybe both 🤷🏾‍♂️. Most new games just don't really captivate me. Most newer games look and feel very similar to me and most are mediocre in my opinion.
gaming,Yes totally change it please! Great fix!
gaming,"Kinda wish it actually showed what you would see if you were all the way in the back of the bus, even though it wouldn't make sense.

gaming,"Why anonymously bash them? What is your purpose here? Stick to your systems then. There’s millions of Nintendo fans out there that would disagree. 

You also have to keep in mind that Nintendo appeals to a younger demographic. That’s why a lot of their games are sort of cartoonish. And do not have some of the more popular adult titles that are seen on Sony or Microsoft.

Yes Nintendo banks off nostalgia, but Zelda, Pokémon, and super smash and Mario big enough franchises to sustain the company in itself. Could Sony or Microsoft sustain off four video game franchises... highly doubt it. 

Also more and more titles are going cross platform and are being made available on the switch. 

Finally it is a Japanese based company, so some of the inherit value to some of their releases are do not sell well in the US.... 

Yes most adults would agree (I’m a Nintendo fan and also agree) that ps4 and Xbox have a better variety of games, but there’s no need to shit on a company that aims to bring happiness to people and especially children...."
gaming,They probably did that math before this trailer dropped. I'd wager that they did their fair share of market research on the character design before now. I don't think the reaction to the trailer has caught them unaware; they most likely already know exactly how much people hate the design for Sonic and exactly how much it would have cost them to re-do him and push the movie back.

gaming,The rise of the Epic Store is GREAT news for EA. There's not much else that could have swung the hate away from them since Origin.
gaming,"I love Nintendo, Zelda, Mario... The experiment with player input (a good example is the Wii) and yes, it might not have had the best graphics, nor the best engine, but the know how to deal with limitations. Not everyone likes FPS, some people like another kind of mechanics and Nintendo usually found them.

Mario Odissey takes mechanics to another level.
Nintendo in-house game don't usually rely on script or graphics, the do in mechanics and playability.

It's true that the legend of Zelda is not in it's best days, Breath of the Wild breaks with the ""Zelda essence"" and becomes another open world game... Another? They made a perfect equilibrium on world exploring in BoTW, they did a great job on the game, and actually it has a lot more of the first Zelda game essence.

I understand that people don't like it, or even hate it, there are very different tastes, that's why there is Nintendo, Sony, etc...  ""To each according to his likes""

Nevertheless, Nintendo is a very tough company... To it's workers. The have a very very STRONG politics of privacy applied to they developers. No phones inside the facilities, mixed language groups to difficult the unplanned exchange of ideas. Also, getting license to develope on their video game console isn't a walk in the park. Thought, this rules have their explanation, and I have to admit that this last year's they became more flexible (as you can see with the Switch)."

Become a bard works well with LIAT."

gaming,"Sounds like someone who didn't play Nioh. Its way different. Still within the souls-like genre, but whole mechanics changed. 

Loot system: Diablo style randomised gear, instead of DS static items.

Combat system: Extremely combo based, 3 different stances, more fast paced, with Ki pulse being a huge mechanic.

Map system: Missions/instances instead of DS's open world.

Skill tree: Has an actual skill tree, whereas DS only has the attributes.

Nobody denies it takes after Dark Souls and uses its formula, thats why the term souls-like became so popular. But calling it a ""copy"" just shows how short sighted and close minded you are. Based on your logic, Pillars of Eternity is a copy of Baldur's Gate for using the same formula, which is ridiculous. They are both CRPGs and share the fundamentals."

gaming,He's talking about the metro Dev.....
gaming,"The initial plan was for a small studio creating a Wing Commander style game with the MMO following afterwards if investors would be interested in funding it. That changed when the Kickstarter was an overwhelming success. Instead of pocketing the money to buy an island Chris Roberts instead invested it to form multiple studios which offered paying jobs to 500 employees. The financial records also show a healthy company that's apparently valued at almost half a billion dollars by people who are probably much smarter than me. I see steady progress every patch. etc. etc.

&amp;#x200B;

But as I said, it's always possible that Star Citizen will fail. We'll just have to wait and see. To me it's just good to see that there are still developers out there who want to break free of the current pattern of corporate fatcats pushing out crap for their quarter on a spreadsheet to look good so the investors get a quick return on their investment. Instead I applaud those development studios for at least wanting to try to create something more than just the cookie-cutter crap the 'AAA' studios have been shoving down our throat all these years. ;)

&amp;#x200B;

And maybe it doesn't bother me too much because I've worked with game developers before (nothing major though, mainly just testing and helping out Chris Avellone with a balance patch for Fallout New Vegas at one time) so maybe that gives me a slightly different perspective? :)

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this makes sense as it's 2am and I should have been in bed already. :P"
gaming,"Per the article:

&gt; Bill Gates had written an email in which he described Internet Explorer as a killer app. In the questioning, he said that the term meant ""a popular application"", and did not connote an application that would fuel sales of a larger product or one that would supplant its competition, as the Microsoft Computer Dictionary defined it.

gaming,"Plot: we're all wake up and realize that this guy actually moved at a snail's pace. Everything else that made him special faded over the years. Other superheros took over, and even Tails singlehandedly took out Dr. Eggman a few times as Sonic jerked himself off. Desolate, he sells his body out to his two remaining fans for a few hits. He wonders why his one friend won't call anymore, before vaguely remembering accusing the fox of stealing the direction of spotlight away from whom it was meant for. His eyes narrow. A thought crosses his drug-induced mind, and he sends Tails a message. It's a video of Sonic, shaking his tiny ass in front of a fan. ""U mad?"", the caption reads. Tails sighs, but soon gives in. Old habits die hard, and who else would put him on a pedestal like he so obviously needed anyways?  ""You're fast at everything!"" he sends back."

gaming,This was in Ladysmith. The highway was closed down for hours apparently to shoot some scene. I was excited when I heard Jim Carrey was in it but it looks really disappointing.
gaming,It's too late now - but you'd think that they'd have focus grouped the initial design before spending millions.
gaming,"Whoa, buddy. Don’t come for me. I didn’t defend steam in any way. I’d rather buy games from individual creators personally, but that’s not feasible rn."

I'll ask you again: What makes you think something with &gt;320,000 sales isn't popular? &gt;320,000 people liked it enough! Is 320k not popular enough for you now? 

No. Instead you're claiming ""it's popular b-b-b-but I don't like it so it must be unpopular!!!!""

I’ve been a Nintendo fan my whole life and have liked pretty much each console they have put out with several games for each, aside from the virtual boy, that was just bad all over. I hate how people just crap over Nintendo because they don’t focus on graphics or online play as much as other systems. They put out a lot of quality work that keeps their fans coming back. Not to mention they pretty much saved the gaming industry after the big crash in the 80s."

It's dumb logic either fucking way."

There are more games on EGS than 4A makes. Many more. Try to read again, cause your reading check failed."
gaming,"I don't expect them to give their engine away for free, the point of my comment was ""Epic is already pushing incentives for unreal engine devs to use their storefront."" with an additional line about how it seems hypocritical given their own stance on revenue split, which I stand by.

I never said unreal engines 5% was a bad deal.  It's a great deal, especially for indies, but if you get on a high horse and talk about how unfair steams revenue split is while you are actively making it even less fair for certain devs to push them to your storefront, well, it makes their true motives obvious.  If they actually cared about devs, they wouldn't be softly press-ganging them with a royalties policy that disproportionately affects every dev that doesn't use their storefront.  If they want their royalties policy to work the way it does, then they need to shut the fuck up about how unfair steams revenue split is.

Also if you think all steam does is ""host downloads and handle card transactions"", you are pretty badly mistaken.  Not to mention the fact that steam actually lowers the revenue split if a game sells particularly well."
gaming,"I use(d) Bulbapedia all the time, it's a pretty great resource if you ask me. Most people prefer another site (I can't remember what it's called right now, I don't really use it) where has community recommended move sets for each Pokemon. 

Jupiter and Dark Violet are hacked versions of the regular games, and if you want to play them you can, but until you get the hang of the game I'd stick to the official releases. I've played a few hacked versions, Liquid Crystal namely, and I enjoyed them, but they can be considerably more difficult than the regular games. 

I'm pretty sure only Red got an official remake, unless I'm crazy. The red remake is called FireRed, and its a gen 3 art style game (it'll look the same as Ruby). They also released a counterpart game to FireRed called LeafGreen."

&gt;buyers of the Steam version can continue to play their existing copy of the game indefinitely and continue to receive support, which Variety is reporting includes downloadable content, patches, and all other future content.

As far as them just deciding to pull the plug on steam support.. not a chance. That's just a vindictive move and I don't know any way that would benefit them. The backlash would be huge. If they stop supporting RL, it will be all versions once its dead."
gaming,How is it that bad even tho no one seen it yet? Yes sonic looks different... but so did the ninja turtles and furry ass pikachu. People need to jump of the hater bandwagon just cause everyone else think its cool to hate sonic since 2005.
gaming,"&gt;CEO/doctor/lawyer/etc.

Yes, because no one in these professions could ever use Reddit. And no one who uses Reddit has ever taken any classes on these subjects or ever learned anything about them.

Just because you're an uneducated fuck nugget who doesn't understand the systems they use and blindly support, doesn't mean everyone else is too."
gaming,"&gt; Seriously though I don't see how getting every kid a VR headset and broadband access to attend a virtual class is going to be better than having them watch YouTube classes with a proctor 

Obviously better teachers is the first thing that should be done, but VR would be more beneficial than YouTube videos because you retain more information in VR. Which is to say, if you're in a virtual classroom or even a physical classroom with a VR headset on, a teacher can take you someplace or visualize something in real detail, and your brain will naturally take note of it more easily. It would probably be more interesting and fun as well if you got to go to Rome instead of watched a video of it.

It would also provide a much needed social connection if they were in a virtual classroom rather than just watching a video from home."
gaming,"I remember buying Goat Simulator just because the 'trailer' made me laugh. I figured I'd play an hour and get bored of it.

gaming,"Also, do you want to have one big store where you can buy the best phones of one single best brand (which is also pretty affordable), best TVs also from the best brand etc. It would be great if you didn’t have to choose between stores or between brands, like you would never make a bad decision in that regard.  
  
However, “unfortunately” you have to think about pros and cons of each brand and go to the store where they sell them for the best price. Hope you understand why is what I described above an utopia. So please spend that 2 minutes to register on epic if you want to buy one of the exclusives and spend 2 seconds to quit from the store when you’re finished gaming if that 1% ram usage is so important. Do it just like you have to check and compare different shops/brands."
gaming,The levels look pretty nice too
gaming,"Alright, thanks a lot"
gaming,"I get the feeling Half Life 3 will be a VR title.

The last time we had a Half Life game it was one of the first major titles to include an advanced physics engine, with gameplay built around it. The previous game was similarly revolutionary in terms of being a major leap from arcade-style shooters to ones with a cohesive narrative. I think they want the third game to be a similarly revolutionary piece that showcases something new, but until lately there hasn't really been any major change in what is capable with gaming. Modern VR sounds to me like the very thing Valve has been waiting for, and they have been working on a VR headset of their own (Index). Valve's games are usually about some kind of trend-setting mechanic or design, so the third game of their flagship franchise would have to be something VERY special.

(And while Valve might be a little late to the VR party, it's not like Half Life 1 and 2 were the first of their kind either. Technically Goldeneye 007 was an earlier achievement in an FPS with a story, for example)"

The games industry is going to be nearly the same. 

And it sounds like you're not going to be in their target demographic, so they won't care about your opinion. AAA games will be targeting the same markets as movies, especially as time goes on and we have a few generations that have grown up with video games.

Sword Art Online. It has its fun, but honestly a lot of it is a chore and your enjoyment of the book is how much you want fluff and how much you're going to geek out over 80s references."

gaming,"&gt; I don't expect them to give their engine away for free, the point of my comment was ""Epic is already pushing incentives for unreal engine devs to use their storefront."" with an additional line about how it seems hypocritical given their own stance on revenue split, which I stand by.
&gt; 
&gt; I never said unreal engines 5% was a bad deal. It's a great deal, especially for indies, but if you get on a high horse and talk about how unfair steams revenue split is while you are actively making it even less fair for certain devs to push them to your storefront, well, it makes their true motives obvious. If they actually cared about devs, they wouldn't be softly press-ganging them with a royalties policy that disproportionately affects every dev that doesn't use their storefront. If they want their royalties policy to work the way it does, then they need to shut the fuck up about how unfair steams revenue split is.
&gt; 
&gt; Also if you think all steam does is ""host downloads and handle card transactions"", you are pretty badly mistaken. Not to mention the fact that steam actually lowers the revenue split if a game sells particularly well.

So... you think it's bad *because Epic is offering a good deal*?

What.

Son, no matter how you slice it 12% is a lot better deal than 30%. If you already work with them for the engine support, it's also a lot easier to work with them to handle the digital distribution! This is simple.

Now, if steam was within 5% of epic you might have a point. But they're not even close."

In fact the entire market had been moving down for a couple months at that point. Subsequent days, ATVI even rallied a bit.

The big drop clearly happened in after market trading on the 8th and the stock opened significantly gapped down on the 9th. This is important because aftermarket trading is very light volume so it rarely moves the price significantly without a catalyst. Unsurprisingly, there was a catalyst for this time: ATVI released earnings exactly at this time - after market close on the 8th. They missed revenue and net booking estimates by a pretty wide margin. So that's, 100%, why the stock went down in this period.

ATVI does over a billion in revenue a *quarter*, you really think investors give a shit about Diablo? The whole of Blizzard isn't even their biggest revenue stream."

gaming,"&gt; with the only choice to get most games being steam.

???

This isn't true at all. Steam has never enforced any kind of exclusivity, and even encouraged devs to sell their games elsewhere as well. If you're a dev and have a game on Steam, you can generate as many Steam keys as you want and sell them yourself, and you don't have to pay Steam's 30% cut that way. It's always been that way, and Steam has probably lost a shitload of money doing it, but they're big believers in having an open platform. Devs *chose* to release on Steam because there's a large built-in audience and plenty of options for discoverability. It was never, ever the ""only choice"".

Locking down games exclusively to a store is fucked for consumers, though."

Before the movie came out I was worried that it wasnt going to be very good because I felt that a true rendition of the book wouldn't translate very well into a movie.

gaming,"It depends on the person. In my opinion I actually find it to be a bit of a turn off. Maybe it's because I actually dated one and had bad experiences (she recently apologized though).

You can simulate button presses decently well with the HaptX gloves shown in the gif, and speakers could be perfectly replicated with headphones. You'd need audio propagation and the headset would need to scan your ear so it can pipe audio down a reconstruction of your ear canal. That sounds far off, but it's really not. Very achievable in the 3-6 year range depending on whether it makes it into 2nd or 3rd gen headsets.

One, “Sleep,” was just 5.5 hours of a nude artist sleeping. A movie, but also not a movie. Another example in a different medium is [“Fountain”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain_(Duchamp)) by Marcel Duchamp. The piece is literally just a urinal turned on it’s side with a signature. Is it art? A comment on art? Is it a joke, a deep comment on the state of art in 1917, or both?

It sounds like Mountain is doing something similar to these examples."

They've mostly been pretty different, fresh, and new. There will always be some similarity, because it's Mario. This is certainly an opinion, but you're declaring it as fact, and you're just wrong.

&gt; Zelda is tired as shit. All they have to offer are remastered versions of their old games. The games weren't event that great to begin with if you get past the rose tinted nostalgia goggles.

Again, demonstrably false fact-as-opinion.

It’s a shit show but that’s pretty much what they were expecting, I don’t think they went into making “goat simulator” with a serious attitude."
gaming,"One of the craziest thoughts to me about this type of VR, is that the program could actually alter how you perceive real life. For example, these sims could be programmed to register a 50 degree real life turn, to actually be a 90 degree turn (this type of stuff is done to control where you move in real life, to make you avoid running into walls and keep you in your contained area). If enough time is spent in the set, then your brain will adapt, you take the headset off, then do a 50 degree turn, and your brain expects you to turn a complete right/left. There's surely numerous other things that could also be affected in such ways. It would be really interesting to see how that plays out"

So my conclusions were that this model will not evenetually crash, because in the future this kids will grow and be used to buy stuff in loot boxes and microtransactions in games, found that the group that complain about microtransactions are between 20-35 so 90 kids, conclude that this is because we grew with a different approach to videogames that the one that exist at this time.

gaming,"If you actually believe what you're saying then it seems like you're stating your opinions as facts in order to provoke people. It sounds like Nintendo is clearly not for you, but I don't know how that makes them ""a shitty company"". You don't like them reusing franchises, but I'm sure that coming back to properties that people know they love is part of the draw. Sure, you're tired of them, but other people aren't and it seems like you're trying to tell them they're wrong for feeling that way. Even if you aren't a fan of their main series, the switch has proven to be a really great machine for indie games and they're even starting to do better with regular third party titles. Your comparisons of pokemon to bioshock are... confusing, and honestly the reason that I think you're trolling. Nintendo has always been a bit behind on graphics in order to offer a cheaper product and a more unique or mobile experience. Your focus on graphics is something that I guarantee no Nintendo fan really gives a shit about. I'll totally give it to you that FPS are pretty bad on them, but I just don't think that's a market they're really trying to capture. You then complain about it being child friendly which just confuses the fuck out of me. I wouldn't argue it limits the consumer base. If anything it expands it because both adults AND children enjoy the console. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what do they have to offer? Franchises that people love and a unique mobile experience you can't get elsewhere. If playstation and xbox had a switch equivalent then I might be more inclined to agree with you, but given that isn't the case I have to once again circle around to the idea that you are trolling. If you're not then... get help dude. People can like things you don't like, and I'm not sure on what planet you thought that your post would lead to a productive discussion."

The reason i love PC over console is because games like Skyrim for examples, have an incredible mod community. So i would rather replay a game like Skyrim with different mods and immerse myself in a different ""way of looking at the game"" to experience something different instead of buying any so called ""AAA"" game.

gaming,"""you think its bad because epic is offering a good deal?""

Reading comprehension is an important skill, one that will help you quite a lot, no matter what sort of path you set your life on. I recommend practicing it.

No, the deal itself is lovely.  I think it's good for the industry.  The way it disproportionately affects devs that don't use their storefront (remember, it's an additive 5% after all revenue split shenanigans.) is obviously a slimy business move.  Which is quite at odds with how they try to spin their revenue split for PR.  Have you seen their public statements about it?  They act like they are gods gift to the industry, just trying to make things more fair for everybody.  I would have absolutely no problem with their unreal engine royalties were it not for the sanctimonious, smug tone of their public statements that seem at odds with their actions.

Discord's storefront will offer a 90/10% revenue split and it's beta already has a better interface and more consumer friendly features than the epic store.

gaming,"The problem is epic is paying just to have the game exclusively on their platform. Steam hasn't really done this. If a game studio wants to release their game on steam and another pc platform, they're free to do that. Steam isn't staying in front just because ""hurr durr monopoly"", they're staying in front because their service is better than the opposition. A lot of the games you find on steam are also available on other services like gog.

  


Epic, instead of creating a good launcher capable of competing with steam, buys games out of steam, and prevents steam from being able to sell titles. That is buying monopoly over that title. If they put up their store, and a game dev/publisher says ""hey these terms are so good we will release here and not on steam because steam doesnt give enough"" that's fine. It's still shit, but it's understandable. However, if it's ""hey epic is giving us money just to stay off steam"" that's them actively pushing the competition out of the way and actively creating imperfect competition for customers. Giving any sort of payment or benefit to exclusivity is unethical and monopolistic."

gaming,"I did play Everything for a while, and I definitely did not enjoy it, but I'm not the target audience. Depending on what exactly a walking simulator is (is it like Everything, where you interact with the world? Or is it literally just watching a model move its legs?), I might consider it a game. to use my movie example, there are some fundamental features of movies that you must preserve. Silent movies are still movies because they have pictures that are in motion. A slideshow might be a movie, if it had enough frame rate. People begin to recognise smooth motion at about 24fps. 12 fps is still somewhat recognisable for slow moving things. But if you take away the picture, then it's no longer a movie. It could be a radio broadcast, a song, or something else, depending on its other features. Being projected on a screen is not a core quality of movies.

Similarly, being on Steam, or having 'game' in your URL is not a core quality of games. Interaction and objectives are core qualities. Lacking interaction, I would say it's a movie. If it's procedurally generated, different each time, that's still closer to a movie than a game, but exists in a greyish area. Lacking an objective, it certainly isn't a game, but a toy. Or simulator. Farming Simulator has objectives. Goat Simulator has objectives by the loosest definition, being achievements that you may choose to go for or not. I don't believe Mountain has any action you're encouraged to do in any way"
gaming,"How important do you think that telepresence actually is to education? I know some people will knee-jerk and say ""of course it is!"" and it _seems_ reasonable. But I've also been able to learn quite a bit on my own from just YouTube videos (especially good for reinforcing lessons). Sure some might cite technical problems, but back in High School I had a teacher for Chinese that mostly taught over web cam between 3 other schools and we were one of the remote ones. While the class was small and occasionally there were bits that weren't quite audible but I didn't feel like it had a _significant_ impact on my ability to learn the language in that situation. 

Perhaps there's other factors there though that might make other subjects more difficult (like drama might certainly be tough lol) and of course the issue with availability of Internet for some areas. But those are kind of beside the point I think as I'm more curious about _specifically_ the role of telepresence in teaching."

gaming,"I think you're looking at this incorrectly.  I don't think they're trying to replace soccer.  What's going on is that they're showing how much farther we're getting in VR.  Just ten years ago, there wasn't anything close to that going on.  

But yes, if you want to play soccer with a friend, a ball is only a few dollars, but what if your friend is thousands of miles/kilometers away.  That's a ball and airplane tickets, and if you want to play again in a couple months, you've gotta buy tickets again.  This technology could fix that problem.  I'm not suggesting spending thousands of dollars to play soccer, but in a few years, when it's cheaper, it could be worth the investment.  

Thinking about it now, you were probably making a joke, but I already typed this whole response.  I hope you enjoyed reading it at least.  Have a great day, jabba_the_wutt!"

But I feel like any negative reaction toward 'art' games is too easily mischaracterized.  It's too easy to paint everyone who didn't like a walking simulator as a Philistine who doesn't want any art in their vidya gaems.

Personally though, I've kind of reached the end of my tether with art games.  It's getting to the point where I feel like these developers aren't particularly interested in what makes games unique.  It was a really interesting experiment for a while, but it's been 7 years since Dear Esther, and we're still talking about walking simulators as if they're a recent development.  They're not.  It's beginning to feel like art games aren't made by people who are really trying to push the medium, but instead are made by artists who happen to like video games.  Games are a showcase for their emotional message, the musicians and those in charge of the art direction.  Those are all good things, but the *game itself* suffers.

It's like if movies were mostly blockbusters up to this point, and some artists thought ""hey! I like movies, I could make that!"" and they all made Koyaanisqatsi.  It's exciting the first time, but after a while you begin to wonder if they know what makes people love and connect with movies."

So have I, but it's more fun and more social to visualize things as if they are real with other people. Going on a virtual field trip or seeing a molecular structure is more engaging than a video.

A webcam is fundamentally different to telepresence in VR. With a webcam, there is noticeable latency, the sound isn't natural, you can't make eye contact, you can't act intuitively together, and you can't share a space together. Now not all of this is here today for consumer VR, but give it another 5 years and it very well should be.

gaming,Witcher 3 is one of the best games I've ever played
gaming,at least with Epic taking a monopoly away from Steam we might get to that point
gaming,How is this not called Crazy Train? Damn shame really..
gaming,Neat what’s the price tag?
gaming,"I think Jim Sterling said it best ""This looks like a movie that was made to check off things on executive lists""

I'm even willing to bet the artists originally had a more Sonic like model going before the execs came in and said ""Na, realism is in make it more realistic"" without understanding wtf that would mean"
gaming,"If Epic was smart at all they would be spinning up the RL2 dev team right now and targeting a release in about 18 months. 

They get a new exclusive, headlines to reinvigorate a franchise, and the whole e-sports scene migrates to it. 

""Problem"" solved."
gaming,"Yep. Same thing everytime. Trashy indie game with trashy footage, but thousands of upvotes and super positive comments. Most of the time when these games release, they are overpriced and dead on arrival."
gaming,Try logging in through their website to see if it's just the app that's acting up.
gaming,Even better auidobook for those who can't sit and read. The book is read by Will Wheaton.
gaming,As one of the players pictured... Explaining it to my father accounted for about 1.5 hours of it.
gaming,"How is it blind? I stated my reason. I also never said I ONLY buy on steam. I've purchased tons of games that are sold from their sites that aren't even on a storefront. I purchased Overwatch and a few Battlefield titles. I have never said I will only ever buy on steam. I just greatly prefer to because I like having a collection in one library. It's cool if that doesn't mean anything to you.

""So why not buy on the fortnite store if you're willing to buy from Blizzard and Origin?"" Simply because I don't like Epics business of snaking exclusives and I don't want to give them money. Playing a game the second it comes out is not important to me. Plus I've had accounts compromised on blizzard, origin, and whatever launcher bethesda uses for ESO. In 15 years ive never had a single hiccup with steam. Yeah you can say I'm loyal to that I guess.

Also I haven't had Origin, Blizzard, or any other launchers installed in over a year cause I haven't had the desire to play any of those games."
gaming,This isn't cosplay this is dress up
gaming,"And the new supermarket cashier's only allow you to buy one item at a time, forcing you to walk back and forth if you want multiple items"
gaming,People are allowed to have opinions.
gaming,"Jim Carrey is just playing Jim Carrey in that movie. Eggman is not a Jim Carrey type character. I enjoy Jim Carrey's Jim Carrey carreycter, but Eggman is not that. I'm sure he'll do a fantastic job playing the part of Jim Carrey though."
gaming,"Did anyone tell those guys that you can play soccer shootout for real and it costs a lot less, and is way faster to setup than this?"
gaming,Earth Defence Force.  Free on xbox right now. It's not pretty but fun.
gaming,I don't believe they disclose that information unless you buy it for your company.
gaming,REMEMBER YOUR PLACE COMMON MAN
gaming,Dear lord I hate Walmart
gaming,"The thing is that epic games does not offer better features, but bans games from steam essentially. Imagine having a supermarket which has a monopoly and makes quite some money from it. Now a new supermarket comes around where there is barely even lighting and little service, yet for a lot of products you have to go there because they’re exclusive. In this sense it isn’t good competition"
gaming,"Sadly yes.... and even if it wasn't too late they still wouldn't fix it cause of all the comments that say ""yeah looks bad still going to see it"". So to the studio people they see this as well why waste the money on fixing it when they say they still going to see the movie... If anything comes of this either A. Sega will say never again. or B. the movie somehow turns a good enough profit to where they do fix it in the squeal. C. they trash it all for Sega's sake posting up a fucking 70% profit loss over 2018.... damn and they say this news the day after the trailer drop the new era of Japan is not a good start for Sega."
gaming,U dont fuckin control me
gaming,"Well that still maintains the core feature of a movie, the moving picture. It is technically 100% a movie, if a shitty one. It might be a good art piece but movies, as normal people think of them, are part of the entertainment industry. So a movie that sparks comment and discussion only by artists but considered dry and boring by the general public (the ultimate authority in entertainment) is a bad movie.

Similarly, Fountain is technically art, but only because art has such a loose definition, it may as well not have a definition at all. Art can have many layers. Maybe this one isn't emphasising aesthetics, but has some kind of meaning .That would be considered art. It would be considered ugly, but it would be art.

Video games, however, are not like art. They're a specific type of product that requires some kind of interaction by the player. They must have some kind of controls, some way to be influenced by action. Or else it's not a game. It might be art, and it might be good art, but it's not a game. It's got the video part, but not the game part. In the same way, Fountain might be art, but it's certainly not a painting because a painting requires paint on a flat surface. Anything else, and it would be a hybrid with a sculpture. And you can add aspects of sculptures until it's mostly a sculpture, but still kind of a painting. But the moment you remove the paint, it's no longer a painting at all."
gaming,"If Valve doesn’t want to produce more games, that’s their choice, and we’re not entitled to do anything but respect it."
gaming,"Bro I am west Asian (Middle East). Still sometimes I can't differentiate between some Indians and Pakistanis and Iranians and Gulf Arabs and Egyptians. 

This guy pass for all nationalities I mentioned above."
gaming,Nah I disagree. You are being obtuse. Have a good day tho!
gaming,"Havel was one of the right hand men of lord Gwyn and also one of the head bishops in the ay of white   But he hated dragons with a passion, so when Gwyn took Seath the Scaleless as an ally, Havel became furious and turned his back on Anor Londo.  

He had the spell ""Great Magic Barrier"" to use agains Seath and also carried the dragon tooth hammer as a reminder.
We also see that he turned to occult magic later in life.  Until he went hollow and was locked in the tower we saw him by ""a dear friend"""
gaming,"As a gamer, husband and new father I do understand a little of where you are coming from, except the identity part! Although I don’t shout about it at work I certainly do not deny it and you can quite often change opinions and stereotypes by showing they don’t apply to everyone.

My wife has a circle of friends and one of those friends husband is a gamer, your ‘stereotype’ gamer at that, he neglects the kids, games all the time and has poor hygiene and a mediocre job just to fund his habit. Habit is an important choice of word here gaming as a habit is closer to a junkie on drugs addiction is a bad place to be with anything gaming included! My wife explained I’m a serious gamer but never do I neglect my child or take attention from her and I work long weeks and game when I can.

You need to talk to your wife about a schedule that works for the both of you for example I work major hours, I’m on hour 70 this week and it’s only Thursday but I’ll be off from Friday to Sunday. I will sleep all of Friday and most of the night, get up early between 3 and 4 and feed the child, start the box up and game until 7. Saturday has begun and the wife and kid are now awake and I spend Saturday daytime with them and the evening with the wife then take the night shift while gaming and go to bed around 3 or 4. Sunday is my day I generally cook dinner but apart from that I have a game running and I’m up and down all day and late afternoon to early evening I game until I go to bed early ready for work on Monday.

Be proud of your hobby and keep it as just that a hobby, nothing wrong with setting out a night or two each week for you to game and maybe some of a day you have off! 

Hope you find something that works!"
gaming,Was your reaction the same as barts here? Lol
gaming,tell me exactly how?
gaming,It's a video game movie. Even if he looked perfect the movie is gonna suck.
gaming,End up using 1 after fall damage
gaming,Actually we are haha.
gaming,I’ll play on pc with you
gaming,The impressive thing is really that this has a higher thumbs up/thumbs down ratio than the 2016 Ghostbusters movie.
gaming,And I'm allowed to call them out for being armchair at best.
gaming,People can drop their kids off and let them play there while they shop.
gaming,And none of them are health.
gaming,"IF IT'S SO BAD, QUIT"
gaming,Yeah it’s super fun.. especially when you get to the endless modes
gaming,Most people this could possible help would never be able to afford it.
gaming,If you want to see more about Boneworks checkout Node on YouTube it’s pretty awesome.
gaming,Hordes with unlimited ammo. Alien bugs in instead of zombies though.
gaming,But is the soundtrack the same like 5 or 6 Bad Religion and The Offspring songs??
gaming,The point of this demonstration was to show that this can work even if those two people are the opposite ends of the planet. This is not local; it's run server side with very low latency.
gaming,Cheers for spoiling part of the main storyline.
gaming,I think Jim Carrey looks like a horribly shitty Robotnik. His scene with the army captain/major was super cringey.
gaming,We already got the issues
gaming,looks like a burnout paradise map
gaming,"I played from before 1.2 the origional release run, let it get up to 1.10 and finally said fuck it.  Mojang kicked out bukkit and modding support was struggling to keep up.  Dumped my 3 dedicated servers and never went back.  Best decision I ever made.  After having servers with 1-200 mods, and watching all the great mods die.  There's nothing new the game can offer at this point.  Microsoft's version doesn't support the modding community of the Java version so having to continue on a bugged broken and poorly coded programming language is a serious buzkill.  But all the fun that was had is still in memory.  Met a lot of really cool people.  And that's the only good thing I can take away from minecraft.  That and I got 16 hours of (not being an admin a day) of my life back."
gaming,If there is no convincing feedback I don't think it will be like Ready player One. But if there is......well porn will be the first thing they'll focus on lol.
gaming,"All cool and all, but people who work on VR know we are still far away from 'ready player one' kind of VR."
gaming,You better have your knuckles ready!
gaming,No crosshair. The feeling of a successful pointfire from a distance with no crosshair is amazing.
gaming,I want to Play D&amp;D in a virtual environment!1
gaming,"This looks gloriously stupid. 
*Goes looking for credit card"
gaming,Are you the red cross hair or the red map marker?
gaming,"&gt; the developers chose to sell on Steam 

And they were free to sell on whatever platform they wanted beside that as well."
gaming,Those words arent evidence
gaming,"Aww, you hate my comment :( sorry, I was just joking. But the game does look amazing, I just put it on my wishlist."
gaming,That isnt evidence either
gaming,Steam is a launcher. It had rocket league. Epic games (owns fortnite) made it's own launcher to compete and they've been snagging up exclusives. Rocket league is the latest and a lot of people really don't like the way epic launcher runs or how they microtransaction the fuck out of their games.
gaming,legit thought I had hit edit. Little too late now I guess.
gaming,My college has ordered a few Oculus Quests to run a test on VR teaching environments.  This could happen a lot sooner than you'd think.  Online classes have exploded in popularity over the last few years and are among the first to fill up every term.
gaming,good thing it's a storefront and not exclusivity
gaming,"Love the idea, good job devs."
gaming,"Nah we just got it not too long ago and like to
Take our time."
gaming,Yeap  you are all right regarding in use of the term but it really irks me and I just can't help myself but fight stupid lost causes.
gaming,"Its sad that we're at this point.

Fuck the normalization of these shitty practices."
gaming,"First, I think you worried too much about what other people think about you. It is also good that you acknowledge your problem. However, it is sad that society makes people think that gaming too much is a problem but while watching TV like a sack of potato is not. I preferred gaming too much over watching TV. One required active brain function, while the latter you can just turn your brain off.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, there are benefits to playing games. As such you may find you have a quicker reaction in real life. Playing From Software games can really train you in that regard. If someone tries to punch you in real life, you have a vague idea of how to block it (proven you played a lot of melee games). 

&amp;#x200B;

All you need is some balance. I only played 2 hours each day if you get what I mean."
gaming,"If it has Jak and Daxter in it, it is an automatic masterpeice."

gaming,i cant stop watching this
gaming,"HaptX Gloves which you see in the gif are very convincing from all the impressions. They simulate shape, texture, and can stop your fingers from moving through virtual objects. Not perfect, but still pretty convincing."
gaming,The alignment of the colored balls bothers me more
gaming,Yea it sucks cuz you could have bought one today at 1pm EST then reserve your spot before August.  Orders waitlist went from June 28th-July 28th-August 28th in a span of 4 hours But i think the demand for the index was WAY higher than valve expected.
gaming,"also it's just humid enough outside that when your windows fog up you're not sure if it's wipers first and then heat, or AC and wiper cause it's foggy outside as well as humid so is that fog? or the windows? or fuck it just hang your head out like a dog until we drive through this god damned cloud. think they'll add that feeling?"
gaming,"Gambling is often referred to as gaming. Australian legislation refers to ""pokie machines"" and the like as gaming machines"
gaming,Why did my mind just explode? I hope XBox eventually gets this. Looks intense
gaming,"I mean they were working to get Rocket League into china for a while. It's going to be free to play there. Now Psyonix is owned by Epic, which is apparently owned by Tencent.

I guess I see where this came from and is going to..."
gaming,Probably they made a couple of them.
gaming,"I've definitely played most of the old ones. Even thinking about getting Last of Us remastered, just to play more goodness.

&amp;#x200B;

But I haven't heard of HellBlade and Soma, so i'll check those out."
gaming,"It's ""grief"", which rhymes with ""relief"" in the preceding line, yo

Edit: apparently it's piece and teenage me had terrible ears? Or made some assumptions"
gaming,I have a pizza coming at 5:45!
gaming,So people in florida and similar areas will be gradually forced to move *over the course of decades*. Slowly enough that we can handle it just fine
gaming,"Thing is this type of competition doesn't lead to innovation. By buying out the rights to a game, Epic is only making everyone else's products worse, instead of them competing and innovating to make it better."
gaming,Nah I enjoy them it’s just with so many the idea is being repeated and is not so much revolutionary but evolutionary hence why they are becoming tedious to play.
gaming,All shits and giggles until you get bored.
gaming,Omg never imagined seeing my username like this
gaming,[[internal noises of the bus driver]](https://youtu.be/ydxIeO-2C2M)
gaming,Bet they also run around with their knife out. Everyone knows it's faster.

gaming,600? You gotta pump those numbers up! Those are rookie numbers in this racket
gaming,"Shhhhh you’re breaking the circlejerk, they’re anti-consumer for uhhhhhhh starting an alternative to the monopoly that is the steam store with their own money?"
gaming,Have you fully shut down origin or just pressed X? Sometimes with issues(specifically thinking of the one where it says it’s full screen and not) the system gets glitchy and doesn’t fully close. Open task manager(ctrl+shift+esc) and then if it’s not already there click more details. Anything running related to origin end the task. There may be more than one process running from origin so check thoroughly. This may or may not help I’m just thinking what I would do.
gaming,Another Epic Games Exclusive
gaming,"Oh, didn't know they stop your fingers from moving, that alone will make a big difference for sure. They just need to streamline them then."
gaming,This looks insane and I love it
gaming,Just make everything earnable again idc how hard. Just make us play the game to earn game shit lol I mean I see a list of things in a game to do to earn something that sounds like someone wants me to play their game I see a price on in game shit they didn’t care if I played it or not.
gaming,Does AC Odyssey count?
gaming,"A little over 10 years ago my friends and I would always play Armagetron. It's an arena with lightcycles, WASD controls (for the most part). You try to trap your opponents so they crash into your wall. ""Grinding"" against existing walls increases your speed (thus increasing how lethal you can be). And it's free. Used to play it all the time in grade school.

gaming,It’s like they didn’t even try or asked anyone about their opinion. So lazy and disrespectful to the fans.
gaming,"Like don't get me wrong, the game looks neat, but these comments, oof."
gaming,What are you homo’s griping about?
gaming,"It's an amazing game, just wish it didn't have so many bugs."
gaming,"You have a 4,000 square foot house and you don't have enough room for vr? What the fuck? Do you have 8 children or roommates in your house?"
gaming,It's more about the feel than the graphics. Need force feedback full body suits.
gaming,And this is a claim that could use some elaboration.  Why do you think that's naive?
gaming,"Prey

I can't believe I never picked it up before. It feels so much like BioShock in all the best ways."
gaming,Even got the clothes the same.
gaming,I approve this message.
gaming,Ive never understood why Raycevick doesnt have more subscribers. Hes got one of the best gaming channels on youtube
gaming,Get help and please have a good day :)
gaming,Soul knight and bang dream barely have ads
gaming,"If you're playing slots, cards or dice you are gaming, you then bet on the out come of the game. You can watch a race with out gamling on it too.  Don't get caught on the idea this is a conspiracy;  gambling on the out come is different from gambling to change the experience. Also it's that kids buy games then kids gamble in the games."
gaming,It's not happening kiddo. We are getting the weird Sonic and there ain't nothing gonna change about it
gaming,"Yeah, cost and size are the main things to address. You can see a detailed video on it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK2y4Z5IkZ0"

gaming,"Dragons Dogma, Dark Arisen - underrated classic"
gaming,thermochromic... thank you for that little bit of knowledge!
gaming,And I thought that Nimble Quest was a controversial take on Snake xd ...
gaming,Another stable genius :)
gaming,"I see what you're saying, but at the same time, I'm pretty much never under the assumption I'll get more than ~20 hours out of any game (besides the Souls series), and even that's being generous."
gaming,"This is like that ""New york city bus simulator"" but not terrible."
gaming,"Fun Fact for you: A developer can do whatever he wants with his game, even if it runs on epics unreal engine. Why? Because they're paying for the rights to use it. Or at least if they want to make a profit with the game they have to pay epic. Otherwise the engine is still free to use to anyone as long as it is non-profit. Where you publish that game is up to you.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine the shitstorm if epic decides to limit games made with UE to the EGS. And devs would likely switch to another engine for development."
gaming,That doesn't make sense. The fingers still need to bend in the same places.
gaming,"A startup could create the greatest user-friendly launcher you’ve ever seen, and they’ll still get shit on by steam because that’s how market monopolies work. I don’t recommend using “hurr durr” when your comment has some hurr too"
gaming,What are the stats?
gaming,This was basically all my dreams when I had a concussion. Would still play this.
gaming,Steam's always been here
gaming,"Needed to make a graph about literally anything as a portion of a presentation on graphs, and I already had the data on my computer lol"
gaming,"But I do not need wares, what do"
gaming,"Damn, that sucks so bad. These games looks so pretty, and have so much potential.

Do you think this is a lull and that eventually we'll get out of this weird money grab and have fun games again? Or is it really up to the indie games and mods to save the gamers of the world?

I even used to love flash games on those massive websites, but they also have dried up."
gaming,"For those wishing they had people to game with... I went years wishing for that and then in 2012 decided to seek out strangers. I went to BoardGameGeek.com, found the forums related to the region I live in, and found several groups that might work out. A couple I didn't mesh well with but I hit it off with one and we've been playing games one night a week ever since. We even rent a house twice a year to play those really long impractical games that can take 3 days of constant play to finish. I'm pretty introverted and meeting up with strangers was far outside my comfort zone but I'm glad I did."
gaming,It's an interesting and original idea that looks fun. Why would there not be positive comments?
gaming,"Well, there's an entire section dedicated to the protagonist buying and fucking a sex bot, so..."
gaming,"Oh so this is an advertisement, gotcha"
gaming,A camera on the back of the bus
gaming,"OP being the one to shill this point makes me suspicious. OPs that post these kinds of amazing future gonna be great threads are usually die hard believers so your opinion is just suspect, like a SpaceX enthusiast responding to a Musk tweet in futurology."
gaming,"I’m not going to copy and paste the bulk of publicly available evidence in favor of human influences climate change to have you ignore it.  Deny it, lie about it, it won’t change what happens."
gaming,My bet is on Huawei. They have some serious potential to accelerate things tremendously.
gaming,Thank god someone else felt that way. I kept thinking i was the only person to read the book and regret every second of it

gaming,"VR headsets have virtual walls that appear when you are reaching the edge of your play area, or if your hands get close to them. I have an Oculus Rift and the virtual walls keep me from punching stuff. No need to do the blanket thing unless you like the physical reference point."
gaming,Thanks for the video :)
gaming,"When steam decides not to produce games is respectable, but when epic decides to make their own is bad? How is this work? people cite exclusivity but i dont see any valve game on epic store, origin or on any console."
gaming,Gamers never die...they just respawn. ;)
gaming,"!remindme 1 day ""check steam daily and don't mark it as read until it is up"""
gaming,"So Boring! I just end up fast traveling everywhere, so it's ""go to location B. kill thing. Grab item. teleport back""

&amp;#x200B;

I may check sunset overdrive out. it looks crazy. how is the story?"
gaming,"Well he didn't ask you to stop while you asked him to ""stop being an armchair blah blah blah"".  

So... Congrats I guess?"
gaming,"Can’t wait!! Bye-bye real world, hello OASIS"
gaming,100% correct.  I have been dragged to horrible movies many times.  They like the shitty ones just as much as the good ones.
gaming,Got anxiety just watching this.
gaming,My most played ever was is around 100 hrs... you practically work at NASA
gaming,"I mean, it's mostly a single-player game with 4 player max multiplayer..."
gaming,"Far cry 5, Shadow Of War."
gaming,"Steam is absolutely massive. It's a blow, and realistically more competition is good, but it's not like it's the end of the world. 

Honestly, the best case scenario would be a few more acquisitions like these waking Valve up and reminding them they are a game studio. Then they decide to start producing original content again, just like Netflix after losing it's library to content producers."
gaming,So it begs the question - what happens to DLC now? If the game is removed from Steam that means DLC cannot be sold on Steam so Steam Rocket league players are completely left out?
gaming,As long as there are still people to play with. I feel like most people that will buy the game have already bought it. I have no idea how it will work out. Hopefully Epic decides to keep it on steam.
gaming,I'm gunna play the shit outta this game.
gaming,"It's tough. I really disliked the book when I first read it, but I enjoyed the story and the world building. I found the dialogue and characters exceptionally cringey. But the story stuck with me, and a year or so later I read it again. The second time I enjoyed it. I've read it about 5 times now and it's a really fun book to go back to and I quite enjoy it.

I *love* the movie. Sure, the plot isn't great and it's a bit nonsensical, but man is it a fun adventure ride. One of the most fun movies of the decade. It's no #41 on my top movies of all time list simply due to just how insanely fun the movie is and the beautiful directing/cg work."
gaming,"Peach-Pear LaCroix. Nice choice of drink, OP!"
gaming,Don't worry. There won't be a sequel to this.
gaming,I mean you can find various public videos and impressions of the HaptX gloves. That's all out there.
gaming,My co-worker wanted a blue sword. I worked with what I had!
gaming,But steam has also a great many exclusives. And epic is a newer distributor which (like any software) needs to improve over time and money (there is a huge age difference). Epic did however say that they will end the exclusives if steam offers a better deal and takes the same cut as epic does from devs and publishers (which stimulates their growth too).
gaming,"Is this a troll post or a very shitty bait?

Saying that Pokémon or Mario Kart are niche games is like saying that Battle Royale games is not a milked genre.

""Zelda is tired as shit"", and then it's still BOTW is still selling by thousands every week event after 2 years.

Nobody ever compared Pokémon Platinum to the first Bioshock because they are not the same genre and came out on different consoles.

""Compare the Wii U to the PS4 and it's laughable."" Nobody has ever done this. The same goes for the Wii vs. Xbox 360.

""If you're into FPS games, the games play like shit on Nintendo consoles."" Say that to Doom and Wolfenstein on the Switch.

""Most of the games are child friendly which limits its consumer base."" More and more ""mature"" games are coming on the Switch so yeah don't say this.

""Other than shitty exclusives that are milked out of proportion, what does Nintendo have to offer that Microsoft or Sony doesn't?"" Characters that are recognizable by millions of people (like Mario, Yoshi, Luigi...) and also they lead the innovation in console market."
gaming,Is it really that good? I look at gameplay and stuff and I’m just not convinced lol. I should just do it and try it
gaming,Ouch. How is Australia for movies? Just as restrictive as they are for games?
gaming,"Because of greed. Simply with phones, each year they roll out a new phone with small upgrades that could have been on the phone the previous year/years just to make some money. You think they aren’t going to do that with VR? Even developers are getting greedier with games now."
gaming,Why is esports so dark. I actually like a well lit room
gaming,Where can I get this!?!??
gaming,"I’ve been pondering posting a thread with the same title.  Mine was going to be more about spending time making my little YT videos about games.  I’m a professional in my forties, well-rounded, very similar to you, OP.  I really get engrossed in the editing and narration and it compelled me to explore little games I’d never touch otherwise, but this little questions hang about me constantly... waste of time, pathetic, do something that matters, etc.  even when I don’t have time to make my little videos, I still get lost in video games as much as I do when I read.  


I was talking with my wife about it again the other night while we were putting together a puzzle; something we do now and then to chill out and relax.  Something about the puzzle just made it clear for me.  Here we were over weeks and months painstakingly reassembling an image that someone cut into thousands of little pieces—by choice. It is very normal, but if you think about it objectively it sounds pathetic or crazy.

Gaming is becoming normal.  We are the first generation to be along for the whole ride and experience the different and changing social norms around it, so I think we may over analyze our place within it.   It is just as pathetic or not pathetic as a multitude of other social activities...  I’ll go jump off a cliff and precariously plunge myself into a lake over and over... I’ll sit in one spot with my hands around a hollow piece of wood strung with steel wires and wear my hands raw until I can make the sounds pleasant.  Etc.  There’s nothing wrong with gamers, even if we are old and responsible; there is only something wrong with how we think about it.

I’m sure I’ll wrestle with gamer guilt again, but I’ll try to think of the puzzle and remind myself that I deserve to get lost in whatever it is that I want for leisure.  As for the rest of the world, they are slowly coming around.  You and I and so many others have been able to witness that."
gaming,"They're apparently selling the game on steam until late 2019. Source: comments from rocket league sub linking a theverge article (which I'm not going to give clicks to).

&amp;#x200B;

So you're probably still going to get your chance!"
gaming,The issue with realistic loading I think comes down to clunky controls. With totally realistic controls it would be great. Also honestly any game that doesn't have an easy mode is stupid.
gaming,"Pitchford would have been better off telling everyone from the beginning that the game is going to have paid cosmetics. A fair amount people aren't *that* bothered by paid **cosmetics** and everyone was more worried about shitty lootboxes than general cosmetics.

gaming,"I mean, it’s good to have competition, but if you end up with 2 powers trying to become a monopoly, it’s the citizens who suffer most."
gaming,"True.

I'd put my \~30 hour playthrough of Prey at much higher value than the \~300 hours I've gotten out of Skyrim."
gaming,"this game looks pretty simple by today's standards, seems like it should've had actual working mirrors in-game"
gaming,Dark souls. The people who did git gud know it by its true name(which involves collecting). Fashion souls
gaming,Modern ready player one is just VRChat
gaming,"This isn't ""competition"". This is Epic throwing their billions of dollars at trying to wrestle away market share. They aren't having to do anything new, they're not giving customers better value or better product, they're just burning money to beat Valve."
gaming,"But this is not really competition that develops growth and innovation, it’s a worse product with horrible security buying out companies instead of being good enough for us to want to use their product. I’m all for competition with steam, but do it with an actual good launcher instead of buying out exclusive games and publishers that force people to use your product"
gaming,Thought it was the Crack Fox from Mighty Boosh lol
gaming,"In Melbourne as far as I remember, its like 18.50 or 20 for a normal movie ticket unless you're a student or it's a Tuesday then it's 13.50.. I don't really watch movies much so I'm not sure if anything's changed."
gaming,"Says, uneducated trumpanzee garbage..."
gaming,"Because from a business perspective, it absolutely is.

It's just the users that hate it."

gaming,How do you lose if a mild collision doesn't fail you?
gaming,"People have been saying 5-10 years in the film industry for longer than 5-10 years... and we're still very much in the uncanny valley.

That's kinda the _definition_ of the valley though too, the closer you get to reality the more cant-quite-place-your-finger-on-it unnatural it looks."
gaming,Yeah but that was campy fun where as this is just campy suck.
gaming,"Ya, until the full game releases then it'll be right back up in first."
gaming,"The vr is kinda scary but everything else is fine it’s more well lit than you’d expect, I recommend playing fallout 4 as it has a good story and the best graphics"
gaming,"does the bus only goes full throttle, or do we control its speed?"
gaming,"&gt;  I felt that a true rendition of the book wouldn't translate very well into a movie

Absolutely agree. The challenges in particular would've been a real snooze in movie format. I think a lot of the darker plot points being omitted was unfortunate—as they were great—but overall I like how they treated the source material. Movies and books are different mediums after all and have different audiences.

My two biggest gripes are that Spielberg didn't include any Star Wars references for the dumbest reason possible. It felt like a conflict of interest to me. The other is the book ending, in regards to how the main characters came together, was exponentially better.

They still could've made it work if you ask me."
gaming,"Never play anything in the genre. 40 hours in and still being amazed by the story telling. Gameplay took awhile to get used to, but now that I've learned how to build an efficient party, I'm loving it."

gaming,The average elevation of Florida isn't that high especially the populated areas. Florida isn't going to go gradually.
gaming,"Nope, the opposite. We get any and all movies, no matter their rating."
gaming,yea put me down for 10 o' those
gaming,The cloud sword was on Tuesday.
gaming,As it should be. I am not trying to say you are like that. I'm just saying I have come across many like that. Most gamers I have met and known both male and female tend to make gaming their whole personality instead of something they do for fun. They have to let everyone know how much of a gamer they are 24/7. It's pretty lame. Anyone who encompasses their whole personality around a hobby is lame and boring af to me. It can be anything and is not just limited to games...*but* gamers tend to be the most vocal about it. The coolest gamers are the ones that don't advertise it unless prompted.
gaming,This is exactly why I almost exclusively prefer TV show adaptations of books instead of movies
gaming,"It already is a household thing, people play Elite Dangerous while watching Netflix and browsing Reddit."
gaming,I have furniture. My biggest space is in front of a large flat screen that is not wall mounted and I don't want to walk into it. The next biggest space is a formal living room with a china chest in it. The next biggest space is the garage and this is Texas so its 100 degrees.
gaming,"This is absolutely awesome looking, major props to whoever birthed such a beautiful thought"
gaming,Still what a bummer can’t believe they sold out like that.
gaming,the Naval aspect of AC is absolutely horrendous
gaming,This is literally an ad.
gaming,"Hey, hey, hey. It's craaaaaazzy taxi!"
gaming,"They can't do that until the market is mature, otherwise they aren't going to sell well in the first place. Most of the advancements that gets us to very comparable Ready Player One technology will be basically done before it becomes a mature market. Gloves might be the one thing that come from a post-mature market."
gaming,"I don't know, all i can say is to stop buying them so software houses and developers will eventually do something but i doubt it will happen. People are like sheeps... they keep buying because others are buying... and pre-orders are the cancer of all this. Think about it, we live in a digital era, you cannot run out of copies like years ago, but still people pre-order... why? Wait until games come out, check some trusted reviews...then make a decision.
Some indie games are really good and they are a godsend but even them sometime are a kickstarter farse."
gaming,Thanks for the speedy reply though!
gaming,I think it's called The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down
gaming,"I see where you're going.

Also, one of the wipers doesn't *quite* get all the water off the windshield but you're to lazy and poor to go buy a new set."
gaming,lead me to the nearest pile of virtual cocaine please
gaming,Your imagination can’t conceive of what it would be like to be able to *fold gum wrappers* into a sword shape? Wow good imagination man.
gaming,this cool but no..player one is not happening in our lifetime
gaming,Yeah I didn't think about it but they shouldn't have had Artemis and parzival meet until the very end like the book
gaming,"The problem is some people really get into VR, and before the virtual walls register for them they have already swung their hand into a TV or something. 

I don't really do the blanket trick for myself anymore, but when I let my nephew play it I absolutely do because I just don't trust him."
gaming,I have those interlocking floor pads like some gyms use and it makes it really easy to know where I'm at. Also the Oculus Guardian system is really nice.
gaming,"Not far off, lol."
gaming,I dont see how else you can compete with steam right now without offering devs and publishers a better deal.
gaming,Just the popcorn and drink is usually close to $20 if not over.
gaming,"The book was really an extended excuse to talk about 80s nostalgia. The plot isn't bad, but the point is the 80s."
gaming,"You're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole."
gaming,Is this really a thing
gaming,"I can see your point actually. I love the game, but it can offer nothing now besides features that aren't why you call it a survival game."
gaming,I was going to claim the jaw and teeth look really off. But then I looked at the face in the corner.
gaming,OR reddit might become like a commufield like in that anime psycho pass!!

gaming,How long will this siege on steam last before it’s finally over?
gaming,I had read the book before the movie and afaic the movie is better.
gaming,We had new people playing
gaming,It's pretty much Twilight for boys.
gaming,"Well that's just not true. Counter strike, portal and left 4 dead are all on consoles. And I'm personally fine when a company only distributes their games on their platform (like blizzard). I take issue when a platform pays other separate companies to only sell though their storefront. Also, Steam just has many more features that I enjoy; workshop, forums, achievements, etc."
gaming,"Literally no point In playing this game now. Epic Game Store is literally North Korea of the gaming industry, sad day."
gaming,"You also have to factor in enjoyment/frustration x amount of time working and x amount of time doing or not doing whatever the purchase enables.

Say I want to buy a fruit peeler because a knife is slow (not true, but it's a example, whatever).  
If peeling fruit slowly is only half as annoying as working, the peeler should cost half (or less) the work time value that it saves.

Equation form if that was confusing -    
Slow peel aggravation = 1/2 work aggravation, so if peeling for 1 hour, buy peeler if it costs less than 30 minutes of work earnings.

It's harder to factor with fun things - is this amount of fun worth this much work-time aggregation.


Of course all this goes out the window if you have limited funds and can't get extra hours or a side gig."
gaming,I hope so too. This might sound cliche but snake is one of my all-time favorite games and I think a 3D rendition like this would be awesome on PS4.
gaming,And of course PC only
gaming,"looks nice, almost like you could slip it over like an AR15 upper or make it into a functioning rifle easily, stock does seem a bit short though"
gaming,Truth. And I had only played once
gaming,"It's a decent book. Nothing mind blowing and the 80's pop culture references get kind of tiring, but other than that it's a pretty solid book."
gaming,They've just confirmed on their discord server that they will continue to support steam. My guess is that it will work like Ubisoft and their games loading through uplay even on steam.
gaming,oh yeah that's real close to what was in that god-awful movie.  I can almost feel the wind blow thru my hair as I drive the BTTF Delorian
gaming,Thanks. It’s top 3 flavors for me

Feel free to follow me on Instagram if you’d like to see process photos and other stuff I’m working on @retroetched"
gaming,"Can someone who is into VR explain to me what the appeal of this is as opposed to just playing soccer? I suppose I understand why a FPS would be cool, but this just seems asinine to me. Is it just the novelty? I don't mean to offend, this is a serious question."
gaming,"[For now, it will stay on Steam.](https://www.usgamer.net/articles/epic-promises-support-for-rocket-league-on-all-platforms-no-announced-plans-to-pull-it-from-steam)"
gaming,"Can't wait to buy this, play it for 30 minutes and then forget i ever had it in my library."
gaming,"BTW, judging from your post history, you seem to be well rounded. You like cars and other stuff too. You're not the kind of person I'm talking about lol. You're fine."

gaming,Sounds like an anime
gaming,Buy a soccer ball n go outside Jesus christ
gaming,Well I still can't afford it. 😢
gaming,"I'm not a fan of what Epic is doing. You see a certain cycle with businesses. They come up with something new or they deliver something valuable for customers, they succeed and they grow and then eventually they become rich and bloated and stop trying to do right by the customers that got them there.

Epic is skipping all of that and going straight to the end because they've got the money to do it. I think that sets a terrible precedent."
gaming,I'm just laughing at the phrasing. No worries.
gaming,Pretty sure it's a novelty .
gaming,Right now I have sold my soul to warfare. Fortnite save the world mode is a close second
gaming,"Funny, I saw it as a term of endearment from one prole to another, comrade."

gaming,Because he was a dick
gaming,I hope so..lol..that is my pick
gaming,"Even after it leaves, chances are higher that it'll still be perfectly playable from steam than otherwise."
gaming,Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
gaming,"I had a mod that added super growing tree's, a mod that let me create alternate dimesions, a mod that gave me stargate portals, a mod that let me blast off and visit another planet, a mod that allowed me to tag someone and shoot them with a tracking rocket from accross the map,  a mod that generated enough power for the entire server.  I mean there is nothing microsoft could invent new at this point.  Like nothing.  Shit there is nothing any new game could come up with that minecraft hasn't somehow had a mod for already.  The community broke innovation with minecraft."
gaming,That’s a good point about Xbox and pc exclusives crossing over. I use my Xbox one controller when I play on my pc.
gaming,"~~There's still a *lot* of Steam keys out there for it.  Start shopping for one now and you might find one at a reasonable price.~~

Edit: it's still on Steam for now, they haven't confirmed or denied that it's getting pulled.  The Steam page is currently getting review bombed."
gaming,"There's literally hundreds of images comparing the Wii U to the PS4 and XBox One and the Wii to the PS3 and XBox 360

Characters that are recognised by millions? So they offer pop culture?"
gaming,"It's not that I think you were incorrect in saying it was an arm chair opinion, if he was a professional I'm sure he would have worded his opinion better. I do understand his point in feeling more secure in a more comfortable system, and with Epic Games seemingly buying exclusive rights to titles we all love, it's easy to call them ""power hungry"" or ""money grubbing"". There isn't much to be done however the system is pretty broken we can whine and boycott but the company will continue making money and not really care about the protests of the players. I have no experience as a game dev or even any business experience but I can recognize things that companies do that I disagree with and am not in favor of."
gaming,I have 89 hours on goat sim
gaming,"I've never experienced motion sickness before from a video game. But this one might push that button. Still gonna try it out though, looks neat"

gaming,"I like to drive the trucks around highway that runs around the north edge of San Andreas, nice and legit, then some entitled npc swerves into my trailer, so obviously I get out and shoot them in the head. Then before I know it I have a 5 star wanted level despite being a law abiding citizen. Also when the police cars chasing other npcs bump into me then give me a wanted level. That's when the RPG comes out."
gaming,TIL. But at least it doesn't make the sting of the movie ticket any worse.
gaming,"Exactly, it already all exists individually. Just need a way to mass produce it on the cheap and build the software to connect it all together."
gaming,"Because that’s the dumbest fucking thing ever. They never did that pre net neutrality and they won’t do it post, because guess why? Because they’ll be hit HARD if they do. Negative press (which they’d deserve) would cause people to want a new provider. Then let’s say ATT goes “oh shit, they fucked up and people want to leave, we’ll move in there and get all those members.” And now Comcast is losing tons of money and ATT has cash out of their ass. Plus why would you make legislation about something that isn’t a problem? Oh yeah also it’s not even legislation lol it’s a regulation the FCC put into place, hence why they alone removed it. All it does is stifle capitalist endeavors by adding all kinds of red tape that only the big, established ISPs can handle and means new people can’t come in and gain their own market share. If you’d like an example look at cell providers. The main ones were really ATT and Verizon. Since we deregulated it, it’s now people like Sprint, T-Mobile, whatever the Walmart one is, there’s several smaller ones who can now compete."
gaming,"Hey! Try Battlerite, fairly new game. Low playerbase but its a tight-knit community and its fun. Free game as well"
gaming,They said the bugs were too funny to fix
gaming,We all seem to forget that it's a dystopia where the world is dying cause we're all too busy fucking off in VR to do a goddamn thing about it...
gaming,"The borderlands games are a favorite of mine. My girlfriend and I play it together, so it's kind of like bonding time. ^^"
gaming,"I wish I had friends who play board games.

I played two sessions of star traveller I think it was called, but damn were they the most imaginative, entertaining and stressful moments of my gaming career."
gaming,At first I was a completely Xbox player. Xbox 360 was such a good console. Then I used the one for 2 years but the ps4 exclusives really got me so I decided to get a ps4. I will stick with it!
gaming,"While that's certainly relevant, you're wrong.  Microtransactions are exactly what the name says; small transactions.

The [Wikipedia page for Microtransactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction) for example, only makes one mention of virtual currency, and only to quote a complaint about sometimes-poor conveyance that microtransactions cost real money."
gaming,I don't see why this is a big deal. It doesn't affect the core game.
gaming,Do you have any other suggestions for games to throw on when there's company? I love that idea
gaming,"Dude, just finished this... I think.... but its really short. Am I missing something? I have the washing machine in the basement still at 35 time pieces but I only have 26 and that seems like alot more. I have 2 of the stages totally completed. Is it worth it to get to 35/ is there anything else im missing?"
gaming,"I know this has already been answered but ready player one got me back into books. Hadn't read a book in years. Couldn't put down ready player one down and have probably read 12 books since. It is definitely cheesy but a fun read.

It might not be as fascinating now that we're closer to that world but still"
gaming,i finally know what the stocker i bought means
gaming,As i see it in anyway a company throws money at developers is good for us even of its in the name of exclusivity. In this case even billions

gaming,I love that! It’s cool when you can bond in that way!
gaming,"This is exactly what I expect to happen as well, which effectively removes me from the player base.

&amp;#x200B;

I play the game on my Linux build (because Psyonix was awesome and rolled out a Linux version after the PC release) basically every week night for a couple of hours to unwind. If / when Epic decides to release RL2 and / or require their launcher (with no linux support), that's the end of my RL tenure."
gaming,fun game. dont care.
gaming,"Steam or . . . Epic? Eh, eh?"
gaming,Modern warfare. Obsessed with gun game and prop hunt.

gaming,Castlevania games are iconic
gaming,"College has changed since you went, old man"
gaming,My theory is the sonic they made has basically human proportions which makes cheaper and easier to cgi in over the stand in
gaming,He's just a common man
gaming,"I feel like everyone is misunderstanding my logic. I'm merely saying that's how I decide if a game I got was worth it. There are always games that don't meet the criteria that are still worth the cost or greatly outlive their cost/time ratio. It's a simple metric for simple analysis.

I don't do much single player anyways. I tend to watch those as let's plays or streams"
gaming,"No no, you have to shove it in the ethernet port so it has uplink to the server."
gaming,"Makes sense, I mean you are already in prison at this stage. Chasing you seems like a wasted effort."
gaming,Look up augmented reality. There arent games like what you're looking for but the technology to overlay virtual objects in a 3d space exists and theres probably a couple games that use it on your phone
gaming,"you dont even need to go that far, just the idea of having to keep multiple accounts memorized and safe is enough of an issue to make something exclusive."
gaming,The stock is adjustable but the receiver is also really long
gaming,Your house is a little over 4000 sq ft and you’re complaining about the cost? Something’s not adding up.
gaming,There's a cool PC RPG called Tron 2.0 on steam where you try to defeat a virus running rampant. There's a light bike segment in the game but it has a full mode dedicated to it if that's more your thing however it's confined to 90° turns. The game recently got patched for current OS support too and it's only $10. I'd totally give it a try.
gaming,"Have this as a poster, best poster I’ve ever seen."
gaming,"I've seen the title Dragons Dogma before, can you give me the gist of it?"
gaming,There's people with hundreds of hours on that game. How!?
gaming,"Not that is absolutely not the case. Smauge was mo-captured, with goddamned Benedict Cumberbatch literally crawling around on the ground to simulate the dragon's movement in the Hobbit movies. Anything that moves in a way a human can manage to move (and sometimes otherwise) can be motion captured and used in some way."

gaming,To add someone to your friends list in Rec Room you give them a fist bump. It's one of my favorite parts of the game.
gaming,"Nope, that is what actual science has to say about this"
gaming,"Agreed! Years ago on the Philadelphia Eagles official message board, they had a subsection for video games. One user wrote a long post about the future of gaming and while it sounded really cool, it also sounded way too futuristic with ""wetware"" as he called it, a chip implant for brain-computer interfacing. Frankly the guy seemed high AF. But looking back close to 10 years later, I think his predictions might have been quite right but off on the timeline by a decade since he said that wetware based VR would be at beginning stages in 2020."

And should your choice of consoles not be based on those exclusives then - of which we have yet to get a good understanding?

I'm not worried though, the entire strategy game genre for example, along with most MMOs, tend to be PC exclusives due to the need for a keyboard. And I do enjoy those :)"

You just have no evidence that climate change is going to have a significant negative effect on everyday people, especially people in first world nations. Because that evidence does not exist."

Sekiro borderline feels like a different type of game that rewards near 100% aggressiveness with a fast paced rhythmic countering system."

Sure, some insanely rich millionaire might get a very early hands on to something like this, but for it to become as accessible as PC/Console gaming it'll take multiple decades."

gaming,"&gt; The problem is that Blizzard is a PC-gaming company

I was just talking about Blizzard themselves, not necessarily their big parent company -- or however they're structured.

And yes, it's not fair to say that ""Activision-Blizzard"" is a PC games company, because they're much more diversified than ""Blizzard"" is.  Hearthstone was originally a PC-only game, and a year later it was ported to mobile -- but it's exactly the same game.  It's not a ""mobile game"" quite like Diablo Immortal, because it's an exact port of the PC game.

And if Blizzard had announced an exact port of Diablo 3 to mobile, with crossplay functionality, that would have been met with a lot more enthusiasm.

What people objected to was:

* Not getting Diablo 4

* Getting a mobile exclusive game that's made by a sleezy pay-to-win Chinese company

So yes, with a bunch of hate/outrage at Blizzard flying around, I'm sure that had *some* effect on the stock price of Activision-Blizzard.  And again, I never said that this one thing was 100% responsible for the stock crash.

My only point was that bad news stories, and public blunders, directly effect stock prices.  That's obvious and true, and I'm not sure why anybody is arguing it."

Why could Warner Bros male Pikachu look right but these guys make sonic look like a pervert?"
gaming,Its like $1-$2 on G2A
gaming,"No one said Epic making games was bad. Making games is a very good thing, for any company. It’s just that their launcher has no features, the secruity of the launcher is shit, and that if you get banned on one game your entire epic account is banned, even the single player games."
gaming,That’s such a good replica that I thought I missed a major fire arms release
gaming,"Real story time (tl;dr after): I was about 10 years old when this movie came out and I believe I saw it in theaters. Anyways, before this movie came out, for a while I had been having a reoccurring dream where I was on a class field trip out in the woods and I had my favorite plastic clamshell Smurf lunchbox (still have it actually) and a couple of the kids were split off from the group and we were near a huge cave set behind some large trees. The other kids said there was a bear inside and dared me to get closer. I would get closer and closer until I heard the roar of a huge bear. I would start to run but realize I had dropped my lunchbox and turn around and run back to get it. At this point, the bear that was at least three or four times my height on its back legs would emerge from the cave and start barreling towards me and would always catch me and I would wake up screaming... until the night after I watched Mortal Kombat. That exact night I had the same dream. Only this time, once the bear emerged. I jumped onto a large stump that put me near the bear’s chest. And I re-enacted the entire Johnny Cage vs Goro match. I won. And after I woke up, I never had that dream again.

tl;dr: Mortal Kombat helped me conquer a reoccurring nightmare."
gaming,"Cost is not much of a concern at all here. You can get most VR headsets for $200-400, and sometimes that's the entire setup cost as there are standalone headsets that run off internal hardware.

These advancements aren't that expensive to add. All the avatar tracking you see here will be done with relatively inexpensive cameras. The only expense are the gloves, which will no doubt be cost-reduced plenty as the next decade passes.

&gt; Sure, they did improve, but not even close to anything revolutionary.

The game you saw in the gif is very much revolutionary. It's the first game to work entirely based on physics in a way that has true player agency. (Yes I'm aware of Exanima, but you don't have a level of control as seen here)"

With that being set though, the world building is amazing and while the plot isn't spectacular it's fun enough. Also there's a bunch of nostalgia references that are great if you know anything from the 80s/"

gaming,"So.. its a ""life"" simulator?"
gaming,I’m just laughing at the name snakeybus. I love it
gaming,"I'm going to argue in the opposite direction, that ""walking simulators"" (and I hate that name because it's needlessly pejorative) care a lot about what makes games unique. Dear Esther wasn't an experiment, it was the start of a genre, a perfectly legitimate one that has merit beyond the novelty of its format.

Part of what makes people love epics like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings are their sense of world-building. These series aren't successful solely because of their plot and characters, but because their settings inspire wonder in their audiences. Walking simulators may be linear and limited in scope, but they aim to accomplish the same thing. They want to inspire a sense of wonder in their audience with their settings.

The way they do that, though, is through player agency, which is something unique to video games. In a movie, for like for example Blade Runner, the director decides just how long you're going to explore the cyber-noir bazaar of the opening scene. They decide what angle you're going to look at it from, and they're going to decide exactly what parts of it you're allowed to see.

In a game, even a walking simulator, the player decides how long they are going to spend in an area, or from what angles they view it from, and what parts of the environment they fixate on. These might seem like things that are too minute to matter, but they absolutely do matter. You can't just write that off. The only goal of exploration isn't to find something. Simply existing in a place of somebody else's creation can be a magical experience on its own.

[15 minutes of Bernband](https://youtu.be/CWVzsg6yWdc?t=550) was more entrancing than to me than any episode of Star Trek, because the act of uncovering a world is an intrinsically different experience than being presented it. And *that's* what makes walking simulators a great use of the video game medium, because it's one of the only mediums (and perhaps *the* only medium) that let's players control their own path, even if that path is always A-B-C. And for many people, myself included, that's game enough, and the only variation needed is the setting itself.

All of this is to say, if you don't like the genre then you don't like it, and that's absolutely fine, but I am going to argue to the death against anyone who tries to delegitimize it as a valid game format (and as I write this, that may not necessarily be you, but I needed to get this off of my chest).

And to nip this in the bud, I don't think the genre is different enough from other games to be called something else. I think that whole argument is needlessly splitting hairs."
gaming,"But what about things like movement space required? A lot of people do not have enough room in their apartments to move around freely, and I highly doubt that VR will take off fully if you still have to maneuver with a joystick."
gaming,I dont mean you cant enjoy it I mean for me personally if the company expects 60 dollars for a 2 hour game they can just go away.

gaming,"Nice work but stop trying to save this mess. They put no effort or care into live action Sonic. Detective Pikachu tho, has my ticket purchases"
gaming,"That's just words. Nothing in there says that EGS is the reason that these games sold so much.

Also, about Anno1800, a significant chunk of these sales were through pre-orders. Want to guess on what platform?

&amp;#x200B;

[This one.](https://steamcharts.com/app/916440) It's quite sad that you can't see the player count from Ubi and EGS. But my personal guess would be that even uplay is beating EGS with that.

Then Metro... jesus that's a mess. Noone knows how the sales actually went. All we know is that they went well because epic said so. But here again a good chunk of players are on steam (around 11k), everything else is just guesses and trusting in the words of the people selling the game through their store."
gaming,ESV: Skyrim because you get to kill dragons and steal stuff.
gaming,"Epic also have a history of being dicks with their games. Check out gow4 with their dlc releases.

Also a tendancy to release season paases that don't cover all the content they say it will."
gaming,The firstn sean is so good
gaming,"Well yeah, unless you don't want a particular storefront using resources on your machine that you don't trust and don't like.  


I mean sure, it doesn't cost extra money, but, it is Digital Rights Management. Some people don't agree with Steam's, some people don't agree with Epic's.  


I find myself in the latter camp. I like the centralized hub. If Epic makes it worth having on my PC, maybe I'd consider it, but I don't like the software, and therefore I don't want it on my machine.  


So they're in a sense, holding the game hostage until you capitulate. I find that rather anti consumer. You're not providing me a ""service"" you're providing me with an opportunity to engage in business with you. It's a storefront/launcher, It would behoove you to consider that I'm using my property to do this (My computer, my PC resources, my data). If I think you're going to misuse my property after we have a transaction, I'm not really interested in doing business further.  


So while it is possible to use both, there are many reasons a person may find the store or company's products objectionable, and as such, exclusive, and inaccessible. I do acknowledge this is a personal choice. However, we must acknowledge that an unfavorable deal made by limiting one's options to buy it from us, or simply do not buy it at all, isn't favorable to consumer choice."
gaming,"The fact that you think it’s laziness to make an account with epic proves that you have no fucking clue what you are talking about, or why it’s even a thing that’s being talked about.

But hey! None of the Epic apologist whores know shit, or else they wouldn’t be that, would they?"

There are lots of usecases for VR where immersive movement isn't  relevant to reach mass adoption. Working in a virtual office, watching movies, playing board games, visiting dance clubs, spending time with friends, using it for general computing activities - none of those will be scoffed at."

gaming,"And yet, everyone lost their shit over FO76 where you could either pay real money for credits for cosmetics, or play to earn credits."
gaming,"No I don't. 

Because they didn't release any. 

They realised a vague statement to try and sell other Devs and investors on the idea that they platform is profitable with no evidence at all. 

I'll believe it's not marketing double speak when they explain what they mean by ""best launch"" and show some numbers."
gaming,"Well no, there very much is interaction, and if you cause the right interactions you can trigger events. You only really “wait” if you want to try the interactions during one of the events that cycle, like a rainstorm or whatever. Most of those events you trigger aren’t seen just by letting it randomly loop. It’s like those little iPhone village simulator/ pocket god type games, that you can pull and poke and find little animations, mini games, secrets. It’s closest to those really old early pc games that were literally little desktop toys you could fuck around with. The controls are constant and consistent (some play notes)... I can still say it might _not_ be worth a dollar to most people. You could set it up as an interactive exhibit on a wall for free and it still wouldn’t become a _must play_ experience. It also does nothing to tell you about it’s “depth” as it is. Which is part of charm, yet also a reason most people think of it as a fancy screensaver"

gaming,"I'm aware, and precisely because of that I was cheering for epic when they announced the epic store. However, the moment I saw them release a trash marketplace and buying exclusives, that's the moment I stopped supporting them. I would rather pirate than buy a game from the epic store.

Steam isn't actively preventing other marketplaces from joining the scene (as we see from the amount of launchers that you need for games now). If a software comes out that can show people they are better, there is nothing stopping them. Kodak had a near monopoly on cameras, they still got shit on when digital cameras came. Skype had a near monopoly, they still got shit on by discord and google hangouts. A startup will need to market itself no matter if it is going against one massive company like steam or multiple companies. There being a monopoly does not change the fact that you need marketing.

Epic on the other hand is physically preventing other marketplaces from being able to offer the same service they offer. That is literally monopolistic. No matter if that startup does everything right, markets themselves well, and gets the attention of people, they won't be able to offer the games epic has paid to be exclusive.

I agree Steam needs competition, but Epic really isn't the one to cheer for here. If anything go cheer for gog. They play by the book and they dont do drm, which is nice. They are the best option for a steam competitor right now, not epic. And in fact, it is speculated that their recent layoffs could be due to, you guessed it, epic. The increase in developer share mightve created some sustainability issues for gog. Do gog have everything? No, but they have a lot. If you really are so against steam buy from them instead."

&amp;#x200B;

I know they wanted to add some action to it, but they changed a lot of stuff, which honestly ruined why it was neat: all the 80’s nostalgia.

gaming,"HaptX gloves are around $1,200, so his point about them being too expensive for Mass adaption is valid. 

Their website won't even tell you how much the dev kit is, so who knows how much it costs from the development standpoint.

Edit: sorry, I'm thinking of Sense gloves. HaptX hasn't even revealed the price tag, though I expect it to be a bit more than Sense since it's not a startup.

For people saying it's not that much money, keep in mind that it's a very minor utility for the headset that costs a lot of money considering how much use you'll get out of it. Maybe the price will come down in the future, and maybe it'll be more commonly used by game devs, but at the moment I doubt it's worth the money to most people."

gaming,"The most profitable media franchise of all time, Pokémon, is not niche."
gaming,"I think Randy misspoke and really just meant to say: ""We're doing the same thing we did in BL2""

I think he essentially means no loot boxes and no pay-to-win powerups. Those are more predatory and encourage ""whales"" to spend ridiculous amounts of money on games. With the BL2 model, you spend a couple hundred to get everything and that's it, you can't spend anymore. Or you can just stick to buying the main game + DLC, which has been historically good from the Borderlands series.

EDIT: Maybe microtransactions could be better categorized... `Consumable uTX` (power-ups/lootboxes/temporary upgrades) and `Permanent uTX` (skins/cosmetics/unlocks). I'd argue `Permanent uTXs` are fine as they allow people more choices and further support the game, `Consumable uTXs` are the predatory ones. 

I think the Golden Key + Golden Chest was a great alternative to lootboxes. I think because it a.) guaranteed they would be good-great items (rare/epics) and b.) you could only acquire Golden Keys by participating in the community/following updates from the developer (on social media). There was no way for someone to buy their way into more golden keys (for that account)."

Right. But I don't see how that is in favor of your argument? Your stance has been to downplay his feat, however, considering how aggressively he played all the time, and the amount of chances he always took, 1 year is impressive, let alone 5. Not sure what the point of pointing out a safe strategy, and how someone could accomplish 5 years as well, if they played it safe, when he didn't. You've already conceited that taking chances definitely makes this more difficult. Do you understand now or do I have to break it down further? It's not the fact that he lasted 5 years that's the most impressive, it's his play style, in conjunction with the fact he lasted 5 years that's impressive. Got it? Alright, enjoy."

gaming,"&gt;They could offer a fixed fee payment model like unity.

&gt;They engine isn't better just cause you made a good game with it. Same engine, same cost.

And they used to. That priced out indies.

Now they offer a % base, which is *pretty fucking fair* given how critical an engine is to a game, and the fact your support needs will scale with the size of your game (and thus its revenue).

This is just one reason why UE4 is popular."

gaming,"Oh, yeah. But with these games, or at least most of them, it's a long way from the customer to epic. And it's a lot less money going to epic overall I'd boldly assume. Also, I don't know if publisher/devs of older games still have to pay for UE3.

&amp;#x200B;

i.e. does Eidos/Squeenix still pay Epic for using UE in Deus Ex from the year 2000 when it's still being sold today?"
gaming,"It's great because it shows that VR can be used for all sorts of physical interactions. Assuming the level geometry is setup as such, you could use the crowbars to latch onto things to climb anything in entirely natural ways."
gaming,"&gt; No I don't.
&gt; 
&gt; Because they didn't release any.
&gt; 
&gt; They realised a vague statement to try and sell other Devs and investors on the idea that they platform is profitable with no evidence at all.
&gt; 
&gt; I'll believe it's not marketing double speak when they explain what they mean by ""best launch"" and show some numbers.

.....

Epic has no investors. They're a private company.

Similarly, the devs themselves have no reason to lie or *allow* lies about their products.

So your claim is that the devs, purposefully, for no reason, misrepresented their own relationship with Epic. With not a single shred of proof.

yeah, how about no."

&gt;translated thought to speech

One is input the other is output. We've been doing output from the brain for a few decades now. Input is going to continue to stump us for decades to come.

Most of our input attempts are also pretty ass-backwards as well. We're focused on trying to do everything on the cortex of the brain (the outer wrinkly bit) which is going to always be rife with problems. What we need to be focused on is the Thalamus, but that part of the brain is hard to get at and will require tech we don't even have yet and is basically sci-fi at this point. We'll get it eventually, but its going to be awhile."

gaming,"&gt; That's just words. Nothing in there says that EGS is the reason that these games sold so much.
&gt; 
&gt; Also, about Anno1800, a significant chunk of these sales were through pre-orders. Want to guess on what platform?
&gt; 
&gt; ​
&gt; 
&gt; This one. It's quite sad that you can't see the player count from Ubi and EGS. But my personal guess would be that even uplay is beating EGS with that.
&gt; 
&gt; Then Metro... jesus that's a mess. Noone knows how the sales actually went. All we know is that they went well because epic said so. But here again a good chunk of players are on steam (around 11k), everything else is just guesses and trusting in the words of the people selling the game through their store.

Yeah buddy, they totally lied for no reason.

Meanwhile random 3rd party website? Totally trustworthy. For sure."

gaming,"Working in a vr industry, we are making great advancements in the field, and ready player one is what we strive for. 

One of the issues in vr that we're working on is space. How to give the best experience with as little space being used. Another reason why its far from reality is computing power required for such a world to exist, and a better network to those servers so all the required information can be processed with minimal delay.

I don't think I would see it in my lifetime, but we are setting building blocks so the future generations can get there."

gaming,"Yea, I've heard about the VR being used in the real estate industry, I actually have a friend who works as a realtor and her office was/is looking into having some set up for them. 

Their hesitation to the goggles was that they're still only used the same way those virtual tours are used, just a bit more immersive; you can use them to filter some houses out ahead of time and save some driving, but for now it's still mostly an extra-fancy virtual walkthrough.

Although I do wonder if, somewhere quite a few years down the line, car dealerships could get a lot out of VR driving tests, since you could push the car a lot harder and avoid the negative stuff like traffic or icy roads. (*I say years down the line not because the technology is far away but because most car dealerships are not too fast on the uptake when it comes to stuff like that.*)"
gaming,I knew someone who had Doom
gaming,Needs a little Hula Doll on the dash
gaming,Sounds perfect to me
gaming,"This. Have a upvote.

I'm no fan of Epic's exclusives, but in the case of Rocket League they are doing it right. Keeping it on Steam and letting the user decided. Uninstalling, and depriving yourself of a great game accomplishes absolutely nothing. It doesn't hurt Epic one iota.  

Also, for those who didn't see. Epic clarified earlier today that it will still be sold on Steam even after the transition to EGS."
gaming,You raise a fair point. But isn't it a little cheap of a console to solely rely on an exclusive game to encourage purchase of that device? Most people aren't gonna shell out the $400-300 in order to get a console on launch to play one or two games. It's an inconsiderate monopolistic move made out of corporate greed.

gaming,"Tbh the book was kind of a mess... the whole thing was just a nostalgia overload. The author will literally list 80’s pop culture references for over a page in an attempt to show off how much “geek culture” he knows. It’s also a bit of a self-servicing fantasy- it’s the equivalent of the “isekai” genre in anime. If you don’t what it is, it’s basically a genre where the protagonist is transported to another world (usually a video game like world) where they’re OP af in an attempt to give the viewer a self-insert so that they too can feel powerful.

That being said, despite its clunky writing the book can certainly be a fun read. Tons of people loved it and I’m sure you will too if you don’t think about it too much. It’s like Transformers but for books."

3D has no practical use and is a minimal change to media, whereas VR is a fundamental change.

gaming,"I absolutely 100% agree with you, and I am also not fond of calling them ""walking simulators"" - I used that term for brevity, not accuracy.  I support ""walking simulators"".

My point is rather that the whole ""game that is not a game"" thing was vital 7 years ago.  The artist devs have not been doing much since then, only creating more games that have a mood (via their art direction, story and music) and little else.  And while I'm all about pushing art direction, story and music, it has been a long time without any real movement in terms of *game* stuff, hence my general dismissal.  The art of *art in video games* has moved on a great deal (which is good), but the *art of video games* is fairly stagnant.

Braid conveyed a message via its game mechanics (reversing time and playing with the idea of the player as a hero).  Papers, Please gamified actual repetitive tasks and tied them into real moral choices that made the player feel conflicted.  What since those games have really explored the possibilities of the medium?  Because all I see are mediocre platform/puzzle games with beautiful art direction.

My point is that the *game* has been lost - not the high scores and shooting, but the exploration of the *mechanics* to make us feel things."

gaming,"DSFix is all you need if you just plan on playing solo.  The online component is pretty broken on its own, though, so if you ever plan to do coop or pvp, you'll need Wulf's Dark Souls Connectivity Mod.  It's actually something you run while running the game, and can keep you 'aware' or 'connected' to up to 32 different worlds (though the summoning/hosting/invading caps are the same).

https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/1047/

If you DO plan to host or invade, or you want to make sure you don't get invaded by hackers while doing coop, you'll want PVP Watchdog.  You can still get invaded by hackers, but it gives you a quick disconnect button that kicks them out of your world (or ejects you from theirs) if it detects hacks or illegal stats in play.  It also gives you a nice little chirp to let you know you've been invaded by a player, in case you happen to be looking at something other than the game.

https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls/mods/849/

I use all three.  Since there's no server to play on, there's no getting banned for running mods.  I'd be wary of doing the same on DS2 or DS3 though."

You can't touch anything in the virtual world, you can't, say, sit down on a bench unless there is a real bench in the exact location in real life (and if there is, it becomes an invisible obstacle when the bench is not there in VR), and you can't smell anything. In the system demonstrated here, as far as I can tell, you can't feel the objects you are manipulating.

I'd really like to see how people will tackle problems like this. Obviously, certain things would have to be limited too: getting shot in VR should not have the same result as getting shot in real life."

They have stuff they own like Half Life and Portal. What else?

They also said they wouldn't snag anymore games *right* before release after Metro Exodus, then they did that again. So forgive me if I don't really give a lot of trust to that statement."
gaming,Remember back in the past when we would all get self driving cars and robot maids? Notice how now all of the young people who saw them embark upon that research are approaching the end of their lives and only have a Uber and a roomba to show for their patience? Innovation moves at a crawl and it may be hundreds of years before there is any appreciable difference. You're going to grow old and die in a world that isn't all that much different in any practical terms.
gaming,"Come on, let's be real. She learned the ancient art of paper folding and mastered the tiny sword technique solely to show off those nails. They are sharp!"
gaming,"Ban cosplay from this sub, there's a whole sub dedicated to this"
gaming,Have you ever been to a school? They will just block that shit like the internet.
gaming,For like 2 weeks.
gaming,Computational power won't be as big of an issue as you think with foveated rendering in a few years.
gaming,"I got an huge group of guys from the Snakeybus right here, where do you want me to unload them?"
gaming,"Oh it is, and in the best way"
gaming,r/WifeBoughtMeGame “wife her” edition.
gaming,"I use RDP at work, but I like Splashtop for the convenience of using my it from my phone for my PC and family/friend's PCs."
gaming,Just finished beating this game AGAIN with my 6 yr old daughter. She now knows what gamer rage is....
gaming,"Let us not forget the real world in Ready Player 1 was a corporate run, garbage filled dystopia."
gaming,[“Game” from Good Cop Great Cop](https://youtu.be/C-n5uDLLLT8)
gaming,Looks like a vector converted to an AR
gaming,"They only take a double render. Working mirrors are basically just another player camera, often dropped resolutions and textures. With what is available to modern devs, real mirrors are very light on the engine."
gaming,"Such a fun podcast. I actually enjoyed the book despite (sometimes because of) its schlocky-ness and gratuitous 80s references, but that show was a fun ass deep dive into what makes it such a rough book."
gaming,The game that keeps on giving. I've been playing it for years and I know I'll play it for years to come (though not nearly as much as when I first discovered it).
gaming,"Hell yeah, the drunk driving simulator was/is my favorite ig video to date. 

Make this as a drunk gaming episode 😩 my needs!"
gaming,I've had nightmares just like this
gaming,Thought it was real and was like OMG where is this coming out but no it's just a really high graphics game smh my head
gaming,Where can i get this Game?
gaming,it ain't winamp tho
gaming,"Like a jolly, sassy opera singer?"
gaming,That line was probably said in the 90's.
gaming,"&gt;  In the system demonstrated here, as far as I can tell, you can't feel the objects you are manipulating.

You can, and it's very convincing. This is a full video on them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK2y4Z5IkZ0

Also, the teslasuit provides convincing haptics for your full body: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC83goKZXK8"
gaming,How long did it take you to make this? Could you make a Grookey?
gaming,Final Fantasy X is my personal favorite final fantasy game. I think it is 100% worth playing
gaming,Saying it’s map is rich and interesting is an overstatement... :(
gaming,Also curious to hear opinions on FFXII
gaming,Tron 2.0 was a thing
gaming,You can now order the oculus quest which is an all in one be headset. Now we can have vr lan parties! Just need a giant room. We also need more games. I just keep playing beat saber and echo vr.
gaming,No Linux either. But I sure do love the 206 and what appears to be Sound Transit livery in the trailer. Please tell me there is a Seattle-esque map.
gaming,"Crackdown. Ten years later, I can still hear the gentle buzzing of the orbs."
gaming,This looks like a mix of wacky wall walkers and QWOP
gaming,I like the part when you just discover a random fucking pentagram in the woods and shit goes insane if you drag a bunch of bodies onto it
gaming,Lol fucking oath this looks good
gaming,We already have vrchat
gaming,How is descent not getting the remake treatment? It's a shame.
gaming,I'm a homo.  Homo Sapien Sapien.
gaming,"Oh damn thank you, must have passed by it 100s of times somehow. Yay!"
gaming,Don’t lie. Your dad was upsetting us all with his plays. I know you were upsetting me with all of you freaking attacks and traps
gaming,"Eh, probably longer. A lot of big name streamers started off on borderlands that and it'll be a new game so many others will be streaming it. So I'd say once three comes out, unless it's extremely garbage, It'll be at least a month or so. After that it'll probably drop down somewhere in the top 5 or just over. 




It all depends on the streamers though."
gaming,"It isn’t worse. I’ve had no issues with the Epic Launcher/store. It’s easy to navigate, the storefront is way nicer to look at and they treat indie developers way better. You can jump in this epic store circle jerk hate all you want, but they are doing a lot to improve pc gaming and developers."
gaming,"you suck  
your mom sucks"
gaming,"Yeah I was young when it came out. I was diagnosed with acute anxiety disorder in my late twenties, (hence the herb) I honestly doubt I could play it now. But hey, that's when you know you accomplished something with your horror game lol"
gaming,"Thanks! I did and stumbled upon ARKit from apple that is supposedly launch 2020 and is just the thing I was interested in. I guess I'll have to wait a few years before is more developed and available to the public. 

It will be awesome to have an E-arena for this kind of game."
gaming,This actually looks way better imo.
gaming,I’m not saying there aren’t games from Nintendo that don’t fall into that category...but you said it yourself...they have a lot of titles rated E....which generally means more fun focused gaming
gaming,"Not the computing in the vr headset, but the the computing in the servers that needs to keep track of every movement made by millions of users. There might be tricky ways to reduce payload, but still would require a lot more affordable computing power. Even if we find such large compute power, it's super expensive."
gaming,I'm having ClusterTruck flashbacks watching this. This game looks like a blast.
gaming,"Come to think of it, and maybe it's because I haven't followed games as closely the past few years, but most of my examples for interesting mechanical experiences are from several years ago. I haven't played The Missing, but that seems like it might be interesting depending on how its narrative unfolds. Obra Dinn comes to mind as well.

I do agree with you, in that a lot of the really interesting stuff was from a while ago. Stuff like Brothers and Journey was 2012-2013 and are my go-to examples for this kind of thing. Even earlier for my favorites, BioShock, Spec Ops The Line, and Metal Gear Solid 3.

Having not played it, I respect Red Dead Redemption 2's approach to narrative through mechanics, even if they aren't the most Fun with a capital F. It was a controversial choice, and I haven't played it, but I do respect a AAA developer who tries to do something different."
gaming,Something so simple yet so beautiful
gaming,"Is it any fun though? I've played the first one for like 3 hours, just lots of running around aimlessly and killing things for loot. No story that I can remember"
gaming,"If your point is that VR is a thing and will continue to be a thing, then yes I agree.  If your point is that VR is going to take over the world and we'll all spend more time there than in the real world, then you are incredibly mistaken."
gaming,Game at the end is Boneworks
gaming,"Adelpha. Magical, serene, varied, alive."
gaming,"Ummm, this kind of interaction was shown in the earliest modern VR demos...The two people tossing a torch to each other is what convinced me VR was viable."
gaming,"I remember similar shit with the PS Move and Kinect though, and we all know how that turned out.

Also as they proved, most people don't want to be up and moving.  That's an extremely small share of the market and why very little is getting developed for it."
gaming,Any plans to release it on consoles?
gaming,It explodes if you dip under 50 mph
gaming,50 mph is 80.47 km/h
gaming,I feel it's different when a Sony owned studio makes a game for their console.
gaming,All I want is fully working hands and face for VRchat
gaming,True. I love borderlands more than any BR but a looter shooter will never take over streams for the foreseeable future.
gaming,I don't think I'd want to hang out with anyone who'd hang out there.
gaming,you guys are old. i don't want to be old
gaming,"12 is less traditional but I find it stands out in the series as being one of the most engaging. As for X it's a staple among JRPG fans as a must play in the genre. Really a defining point in game development overall, as it showed the scope of what could be done on the PS2.

The remasters feel really good if you have the option get those."
gaming,I highly recommend audiobook over written. I listened to the audio book and loved it but I imagine the written could get a bit tedious as there are a lot of details
gaming,My favorite is borderlands 2
gaming,"We are ***so far*** from ""jacking in"" ala Neuromancer - where we could experience an alternate reality fully, including senses of touch, taste, smell, warmth, texture, etc..."
gaming,i dont get it...
gaming,"If you think these few small tech demos are anything like Ready Player One, think again."
gaming,Why is Epic buying Psyonix a bad thing though? I don’t see a downside.
gaming,"For a moment there, I thought the pawns were goombas."
gaming,"He got it for me while out of the country. IIRC he said it was handmade, I’m not sure about the pieces but the board was def made by hand. It’s one of the few things I still have that he gave to me before passing away in 2011."
gaming,"Pretty important difference though. They were wearing tracking sensors, whereas this is all camera based and better tracking to boot. The average user won't wear tracking pucks, and it adds cost too."
gaming,It's the fact they're going to remove Rocket League from the Steam store that really irks me. Even EA didn't remove any of their games that had already came out when Origin Launch.
gaming,Apple is working on true AR glasses now. They should be out by 2022 at the latest.
gaming,"Alternate opinion: the book is atrociously written , and the movie, despite its flaws, actually improved it by removing the narrator and revamping the story."
gaming,Crowbar clip is confirmed Half-Life 3.
gaming,Jörmungandr would very much like to play this game.
gaming,This game looks fucking epic. Are friends included or do I have to buy those separately?
gaming,Snatch is available on Netflix
gaming,Can’t wait for a porn game like this
gaming,Snakeybus Battle Royale Slither.io style confirmed?
gaming,"aye shamai, thats a good bit of quality i see there"
gaming,"I agree, I hate when kids complain about games not being on steam, why should you stop playing/trying out a game because it’s on epic it’s pathetic."
gaming,"EGS offers refunds and tech support though, I'm sure you can find some convincing reasons without using dishonest arguments."
gaming,"If you actually have standards, than no it's not petty. I have standards so I don't have Epic because of thier constant anti consumer actions and will never support them, if I lose out on a couple of games oh well, plenty of other ones from ages past and ones coming soon that will get my money."
gaming,"Jack Box Party Pack series is great since people can play with phones, but best when a majority of the room is engaged with the game.

Overcooked is a ton of fun to play / watch.

Keep Talking and No One Explodes and Ultimate Chicken Horse are also great options."
gaming,Appears they still only have 1 checker though.
gaming,This guy speaks my language.
gaming,You'd be pretty surprised...
gaming,Right! Lol XD i just smoke to smoke that whole series fucked me up haha
gaming,Step 0: Make 3 friends
gaming,"I mean, the book is still fantastic, so I wouldn't say it is MUCH better. It is just a really incredible movie."
gaming,wait what's Fallout New Vegas? my dad has all the games that are out for the Nintendo. how could he have missed that? he knows everything maybe I should ask him.
gaming,"These are all real demos, no trickery here. VR doesn't necessarily mean moving about. You can still do plenty of things and play plenty of games seated."
gaming,Let’s go make some CRAZY money!
gaming,My two boys love goat simulator.   It is like their all time favorite game.  I eventually bought them every goat simulator game they made.  The payday one is the only one that enjoyed more than a few minutes with.
gaming,No they do nothing they just buy the game for exclusives and that’s it sure they provide more income but people have had issues with malware. Long story short *epic sucks*
gaming,Lol I think you got downvoted for having nice things my dude. I’ll bump you back up.
gaming,Not really. Basic teenage geek fantasy with loads of nostalgia references.
gaming,Porn will destroy humanity.
gaming,Huh. Interesting. Wonder how well they’re going to be in real world situations.
gaming,I didn’t spend money on another game for a little over a year after I bought Witcher 3
gaming,"Dude, it’s 2019. That’s a rear view camera display."
gaming,It took me a while to understand why they fucked up Sonic and they continue to keep fucking up game characters: They're in the film world and have no fucking clue or emotional/mental/historical/visual connection with the game.
gaming,"A different user posted a photo from her Instagram and she has the same skin tone. If you look up her IG, you’ll see photos of her."
gaming,"&gt;If you get a psvita with firmware 3.60 or below

You're good up to 3.68 now with h-encore."
gaming,Movie didn't touch half of the book
gaming,And that’s a bad thing because...?
gaming,Commenting so I remember
gaming,I can only see warfare technology developing until a point that it can easily destroy entire countries. Hopefully we’ll have better control over other areas of technology lol
gaming,"Agree agree agree. The main character is very clearly obviously nerd wish-fulfillment for the author, who still has that ""Revenge of the Nerds"", ""everyone hates GAMERS AND NERDS"" mentality that is absolutely toxic. It's an okay book and the world building is decent, but the ""bad guys"" are ridiculously written and I found myself actively disliking the ""hero"" because he was the embodiment of every NEET-ass ""gamer guy"" who is obsessed with pop culture and gatekeeping."
gaming,Omg yes I would buy this in a heartbeat on switch
gaming,Are you fucking kidding me. Out of all the games they could shit on they had to take the only one I play? Its been real.
gaming,"It's not Nintendo, here's a link about it :https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas"
gaming,This version of SAO sucks. Uninstalled.
gaming,"$10 for 25 hours of entertainment, better value than any film."
gaming,Mine was the m24 sniper rifle. Sniping was so fun.
gaming,GTA V doesn’t iirc
gaming,Considering technology is moving at a literal exponential rate I would hold your tongue
gaming,That force grab of the gun at the end was badass :o
gaming,"The verbiage is vague, but when they are brought forward in time, Raiden says they were just at the tournament... it’s entirely possible, sub zero was already dead when they time jump happened. That was my thought anyway."
gaming,"What could Oculus quest offer that you can't currently get on Youtube/conventional screen-based tech? Honest question. The reason why schools exist is partly to ensure some sort of network and foundation for kids who would not otherwise be educated. Let's be honest, it's also a form of daycare to give parents time to do other stuff with their lives. Do you think kids are self-motivated to strap on their VR headsets and learn for hours a day? Who is going to be home with them? Do they go to another gathering place where they can be supervised when attending VR school? I don't see how this is supposed to work."
gaming,Also the lack of Rush in the movie really sucked!
gaming,"I'll be honest, I tried reading the book and stopped halfway through. I didn't care for it much though it did have some redeeming qualities and if you think you'd like it it's worth reading. 

Somehow the movie managed to take a mediocre book and absolutely turn it to shit though. They changed countless plot points that were incredibly important to the story."
gaming,They won't ship it until it's good enough for real world situations where things can mess up easily.
gaming,You....... can’t do that
gaming,I love that gun but also let's not forget m60 was amazing game
gaming,Warhammer: Space Marine and Space Hulk: Deathwing
gaming,That is not de way
gaming,"We have 12 years to turn things around for Earth otherwise, we still aren't getting this in our lifetime."
gaming,Get this shitpost bot outta here
gaming,The problem with these are they’d require a pretty large open space
gaming,So cool. Thanks for the new lockscreen
gaming,"That's actually surprising to me. $1,200 or even $5,000 price points mean that with large-scale adoption these might be affordable in the next 10-15 years. Think about how expensive flat screen TVs were at first or 4K televisions. 10 years later, retailers are selling them at *consumer* (not merely enthusiast) prices."
gaming,"You guys did a great job of capturing that hectic spirit while maintaining your own unique vision for a fun game from the looks of it. 

Added it to my wishlist already, looking forward to release. Best of luck to you guys!"
gaming,I liked the movie more personally.
gaming,"My trick is to just remember how to spell ""finite"", which is a lot easier to remember because it is spelled how it sounds."
gaming,Makes you wonder if he hadn't touched this game for a year or so and only clicked play today to hide that fact by updating his 'Last Played.'
gaming,"great JRPG all round.  the voice acting is questionable at times (though voice acting full RPGs was new at the time), and if you're a completionist then the side stuff will drive you absolutely insane.  the main character also starts out insufferable, but he gets better."
gaming,I'll never play it but honestly it seems like a pretty cool concept.  Perhaps there are just people genuinely excited about it?
gaming,"Reminds me if chappie, where the giy transfers himself into the robot"
gaming,"Because they didn’t set any expectations of a goal. There is no score, no objectives, the “controls” effectively don’t _do_ anything. Like, by no means is this a sword I’m trying to fall on, for _mountain_ of all things. But you make something like this, you don’t go out of your way to advertise things it _isn’t_."
gaming,"Then when the millions of capital they invested in doing this fails utterly and completely, they'll complain about another minimum wage hike and raise the price of goods reinforcing the entire concept that minimum wage hikes precipitate inflation and no one wins. 

Welcome to America. Where the concept of ""These hard working entrepenuers earned every dime."" Is always on the backs of employing people who are woefully underpaid."
gaming,"Blitzball.

Amazing story.

No save anywhere."
gaming,Their attempt at getting more eSports acquisitions?
gaming,"Real talk what if the solution to poverty and climate change is hooking the 99% up to VR 24/7 with a feeding tube and a colostomy bag. VR all day every day, fuck the real world"
gaming,"This is about tech and software implementation, not about the OASIS."
gaming,"They're not removing RL from steam, they said steam user's will still get full support and update for the game, it just means the game's going to the Epic Game Store and that the devs have more money to work with."
gaming,"When you're trying to grab virtual objects &amp; orient them the right way, then slot them in right, pull levers or whatever it takes a while to figure out. For me it did anyway, and I've played a fair amount of VR. It's definitely not fast enough for the average user for a smooth experience. I also live in a country with a gun ban, so that probably doesn't help. It was also a rough estimate, I didn't actually time how long it takes me."
gaming,"Sensorial feedback, and either non-tethered design or full dive systems are still quite away from feasibility though."
gaming,Yes but with raid bosses and some bullshit areas where your magic crystals don’t work and no indication of where those will be. Plus random unique abilities that nobody else in the entire game can have
gaming,We're going to be the 90 year olds in 20 year olds avatars. Lol
gaming,Haha holy crap that Payday trailer is funny
gaming,"I just want Sword Art Online without the whole ""You're trapped and could die"" part."
gaming,Account hack or just went insane?
gaming,Um? No it didn't.
gaming,I don't think there is anything wrong with reviewing a game based on the business decisions of the developer.  Who owns a game can tell you a lot about the future of it and whether its worth investing time into or not.
gaming,Welcome to the Knight Bus
gaming,You have no idea
gaming,Metal Gear Solid on the PS1.
gaming,Technically he's wrong since Brazilians aren't Latino/Latina.
gaming,TIL businesses try to maximise profits.
gaming,Have you ever played this game? It's took an hour to unbox and punch it and setup properly the first time lol
gaming,This reminds me of PS1 days lmao
gaming,"But if you die in rl, AI will approximate you well enough in game, your friends won't know you died irl."
gaming,"I am an old man, so can someone ELI34 for me? I don't get what's happening."
gaming,I never knew I needed this in my life
gaming,Can you imagine VR L4D?
gaming,"Cool art style. I think [Clustertruck](https://store.steampowered.com/app/397950/Clustertruck/) should  get an honorary mention because it's also an idie project, chaotic as fuck with quick decision making and might appeal to the same type of people. At least i thought of it at first."
gaming,"I don't know, but I think they did mention they weren't sure what they were going to do regarding that yet, so there is some hope there at least."
gaming,I never want to see another post about how useful user reviews are
gaming,Yeah I don’t see it
gaming,"Indeed it is. The book was so good I finished it in 2 days of me buying it and I rarely ever read books so that tells you something. Go for it, even if you watched the movie. The movie barely touched any of what was written in the book believe it or not; kinda disappointed about it"
gaming,What is this? I’ve never seen this contraption before.
gaming,Definitely a top 3 game series of all time for me. I tend to go with Mass Effect 2 as my favorite one.
gaming,"I've always thought of it as the author's fantasies from childhood that amounted to ""what if being a nerd was cool???"", but with a bunch of toxic incel undertones and elitism. 

I think I was finally totally turned off from the book (because again, this is the author's self insert speaking), when the main character makes the girl he's into absolutely insist that she's biologically a woman, because it's implied that he wouldn't want to date her if she were trans. Like..this book was published in 2012. Come on dude!"
gaming,What game is this?
gaming,Sorry I'm a Nintendo 64 player
gaming,Oh I know it will not happen why?  Because at the rate humans are destroying the Earth the next generation will be the last if my ability to see into the future is right.
gaming,"if guns where people, then this a pornstar"
gaming,This is so cool
gaming,Have you even played Rocket League? They already have other sports like Basketball and Hockey.
gaming,can't wait to play this in 2020
gaming,Game is going to be 12 years old this year. Time flies man.
gaming,A trading-card game about capitalism
gaming,"“Too bad Rick, you’re inside of a simulation, that’s inside of a simulation, that’s inside of a simulation, that’s inside of....another simulation!!!.”"
gaming,"No sorry, I still think VR is a fad. Wearing a screen on your face is never going to go mainstream."
gaming,"Have you ever been to a Round 1 or are they only on the west coast? They've revived arcades by bringing arcade machines back. Those huge cabinets where you sit in a machine and kind of have a ""ride"" experience are slowly but surely bringing the arcade experience back. 

For our generation it was cabinets that could do graphics/games that we couldn't get at home on our consoles because those cabinets were devoted to those games or only a few games. Now that home consoles and PCs have great graphics the arcade industry realized they have to give an experience instead of just a game. 

Plus they will also have games people used to like to play against each other in the arcade like MvC and the new Streetfighter, and of course ticket games. 

Its kind of like the arcade cabinets you only saw in a bowling alley or movie theater got gobbled up, improved on, and put in one place with ticket machines and DDR clones. Its really awesome and I think its a Japanese chain brought to the U.S.."
gaming,"It makes sense, you're just certain I'm incorrect.  VR is not a progression of the PC.  People will not drift away from PCs and desks to strapping their headsets on and physically interacting with an interface.  I'm sure I don't have to elaborate on why that isn't feasible or desirable for a majority of people.

Your point about cost is very valid though, I'll admit I was wrong there.  In general, gaming requires a system and a game.  I suppose the cost of a VR unit is already not much more than a console+the TV/monitor you would need."
gaming,"Maybe this will inspire someone to come up with a new engine?  
One could hope I guess."
gaming,You have to have been ignoring the story man
gaming,The Devil May Cry reboot.
gaming,Wouldnt Crazy Snake be more fitting
gaming,The Oculus quest is on the market for $400 and is able to run VR at comparable capacity

[https://store.steampowered.com/app/823500/BONEWORKS/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/823500/BONEWORKS/) \-That's the game on steam."
gaming,Looking forward to built in voice chat like the kids have on Forthnight.
gaming,"I’m not sure about Steam, but now that Epic owns Rocket League, I think there will be even more updates for the game. I’m not saying this is a good thing, but Epic is a good company when it comes to updating games. Fortnite had like 50 updates in the past year, which is insane."
gaming,EA Sports: It’s in the game
gaming,"One of my favs to burn and play recently was probably Farcry 3 when it came out mostly because when I did the mission where you burn the pirates weed plantation with a flamethrower while Skrillex 'Burn dem' played I had just smoked and could not stop laughing.

https://youtu.be/5SAzg0rfC08

Yes Jason, it was fucking awesome"
gaming,"You are allowed to have an opinion, but if it's not a good one, you should really keep it to yourself."
gaming,"Lunching = having lunch. 
Launching = what you meant to say."
gaming,"That's fair.  But I've had a hell of a good time with a few 2-3 hour games that were totally worth the 15-20$... although I AM a couple of decades past my student years, so yeah easier for me to scrounge that up"
gaming,That ramp is op
gaming,They all look like tiny dicks
gaming,If you think CoD is toxic you haven't seen NOTHING.
gaming,Valve doesn't need to fight back. Epic will implode all on their own.
gaming,The price of reality is dropping

gaming,I honestly don’t give a shit about fake internet points
gaming,"Unless I’m missing it, I think you made a mistake."
gaming,Sorry for your loss
gaming,"That’s why I said that. Without trackers, I’d imagine it’s probably going to be hard to make it perfect and to be launch ready. Would definitely be cool if they can pull it off. I’d love to see a headset similar to the new oculus that doesn’t need any mounted sensors because it’s all in the headset"
gaming,It’s my favorite game of all time so I’m probably the wrong person to ask.
gaming,Duck Hunt is so fun i love the zapper i find that the dog is so cute.
gaming,"Damn, I need a free HTC vive"
gaming,"Not true. Many of the early games had more levels than most people would bother to get through. For instance, Pacman, Galaxian, tempest. If you were good enough you could make a quarter last an hour or more."
gaming,"Fair! Definitely get that one though, it’s great."
gaming,I just for Ready Player One to become an open world game!

gaming,I've never heard of that? Are you sure its out on the  Nintendo?
gaming,"Then what happens to all the games they've taken as exclusives? Now that Psyonix is owned by Epic, if Epic goes down, so does Rocket League. That's only one of the huge games that will be affected if this happened, and the number is constantly growing."
gaming,"No it's not, we need a haptic feed back device, not just VR."
gaming,The ideal version of Speed: The Video Game.

gaming,New screen saver too!
gaming,"I really don't like FFX. It's super linear, most of the main cast is unlikable, the world design is pretty bland, and the plot borders on insultingly stupid at points. And the English voice work is horrendous. 

If you want a Final Fantasy game on Switch get VII, IX, or XII. If you just want a good JRPG consider any of those and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Octopath Traveler. Dragon Quest XI S when it launches"
gaming,"Do you kind of just have to develop a model and attach it to it...if that makes any sense? Do you just create a model and give it animations then attach the MOCAP data? Not trying to make it sound simple, but it's what my simple brain might be able to understand here."
gaming,Super easy solution: Don’t buy them!
gaming,Below the red hit bomb should be a 3. And the one by the X bomb I think should be a 4.

gaming,"On one hand, I like having a one stop shop for everything (Steam).  On the other hand, I don't really like the idea that Steam has a monopoly and takes a massive 30% of sales from games.

I envision the next step is development of a launcher which combines all other major launches into one functionally xD"
gaming,Programming courses are a path to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural
gaming,"This looks difficult as hell, holy shit"
gaming,What if i’m 99 years old?
gaming,Ya know what. I've seen the series and I'd still fucking buy it and play it.
gaming,Forever. They can't take it away because you paid for it. That would probably trigger a lawsuit.
gaming,You talking adopt game grumps? They did this on one game and I was trying so hard to not get annoyed. Honest to god I don't have the patience to watch streamers....
gaming,isn't th eonly system the Nintendo you know with the white and black box and plastic things you put into it?
gaming,I really wanna play this lol
gaming,"Most games are timed exclusives and coming to Steam within 6 to 12 months after their release on Epic. Also most of those ""exclusive"" games are available on other platforms (uplay, and Microsoft Store mostly)."
gaming,Is this a new age of chivalry basically?

gaming,Building coming to Rocket League?
gaming,"nice lead up, 10/10 that song was entirely educational."
gaming,Wow this is incredible my grandfather had a set that looks incredibly similar! Do you know who made it/where it came from? He passed about a year ago and I never asked him about it.
gaming,This actually looks like a fun game
gaming,"Fact - no game of Monopoly has ever been completed according to the rules, it merely ends in the game being declared over due to a fistfight."
gaming,I need to get that game again.
gaming,I have a wife and kids and work night shift so gaming time is the really an issue for me. On my days off Im a family man during the day and a gamer at night while my family sleeps. So yeah I'm like the Batman of gaming😎
gaming,Sometimes I wonder why they can't do things like this. Same thing with TMNT.
gaming,"Can we talk about your group's drink choices. 2 La Croix, a white wine (maybe flat beer, unsure), a martini, and...a coffee?? What is happening here? Is everyone alright?"
gaming,My guy it’s not a thing that you can just fix before it happens. It hasn’t happened to you yes happy days to you. But other people have gotten malware and viruses from epic. Also you realize that epic has like no customer support at all now that is really sad
gaming,Yep on xbox one
gaming,Where has this game been all my life?!
gaming,I feel like most VN are psycho horror. I died numerous times trying to romance husbandos. :'C

gaming,Fucking love Battle Toads
gaming,And they’ll likely get all your personal info when you connect to their servers to play. Fun times we live in
gaming,Where you looking at the girl in the red dress?
gaming,"Agreed. And UE4 only has Linux support because of community efforts. No way Epic supports Linux in future releases of RL / their store. 

It was a good run I guess..."
gaming,"Anytime. One of my favorite games of all time is “A story about my uncle” which your game looks to be along the same vein (not to be a buttsniffer). A simple but unique idea executed with attentive detail and focus on pure, undiluted enjoyment. We have a similar mantra in the culinary field. I’d rather cook a 12 item menu with love and perfection than a 40 item menu with half assed results. You got my support."

gaming,*from way in the back* WHAT?
gaming,"Yup.  When it comes to new games, fine - they can be funny.  But when it comes to Zelda... I get mad."
gaming,My cat manages to get himself kicked and stepped on without me romping around in VR. (I’m not abusive he’s just an idiot.) I’d probably accidentally squish him if I had this.
gaming,Did anyone ever try the Millenium edition...?  We played it around christmas and even though the game was over by the rules someone else decided to play their own rules and oh look i won.. dont remember the specifics something about the experience points.  it was bullshit and we never played the game again
gaming,I mean we still have a ways to go. In order for it work we have to fully understand conciousness so we can upload it into a game.
gaming,"When we play scythe we keep a counter on how many times someone says ""I f'd up."" 

Love that game..."
gaming,"&gt; It makes sense, you're just certain I'm incorrect.

I am certain because there is no logic here. 3D movies and VR couldn't be further apart. VR has the potential to change the world. I don't believe adding a few depth cues from 3D glasses has changed one person's life, let alone the whole world.

&gt;  People will not drift away from PCs and desks to strapping their headsets on and physically interacting with an interface.

VR+AR could very well do that. What's the point of a monitor when you have an eventual pair of sunglasses that are nice and comfortable that let you simulate infinite computing space anywhere you go since it would be portable. The only downside here is communal viewing (which isn't really that relevant for monitors in the first place. TVs, you have a point) and having to wear something, which again would be comfortable and so useful at most moments in our life that we'd all likely live to just wear them very often.

I bet you that as the tech gets better, many workplaces will ditch monitors and office space and have lots of employees beam in virtually into the same shared space."
gaming,"Looks really fun, can't wait to check it out!"
gaming,Bring it on! I want my own RX-79-2
gaming,"My argument against that is that they do not really convey the gravity of his situation.
In the movie we meet him with a Delorean (expensive in the OASIS) he has an Omni thread mill and more impressive haptic gloves than what is described in the book (both of which are expensive).

In the book, he literally had nothing but a few laptops he salvaged from junk yards and his public school oasis rig."
gaming,"Well, considering path of exile has been one of the most commercially successful action RPGs for nearly seven years now and counting, I think he's probably hit some deadlines before..."
gaming,"No, April for PC, September for console. Dont act like PC is the only way to play"
gaming,"MGS3, Last of Us, God of war 2 &amp; 2018, Diablo 2. Can’t pick a first, but these are my favs."

gaming,SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT
gaming,"Sword Art Online called, they want their tagline back."
gaming,"For me, it all depends on that omni-directional treadmill. Once that becomes affordable... Oh man"
gaming,I know neither of the answers to your questions lol. If I had to warrant a guess I’d say somewhere in South America.
gaming,"People have done that with many other games and I don’t think there have even been attempted lawsuits. Knock on wood. I wouldn’t buy this pancake style myself, but I’d buy it in VR."
gaming,RPO won’t happen because there is no massive multimillion dollar company willing to give out access to a game and internet for only 5 bucks

Not to mention the screwed the pooch on the whole egg competition"

gaming,"The evolution of Battle Royale: Tron cycles, where everyone makes a closing circle."

gaming,Or stealing from another player and then being told the other player is out of the will when they are caught.
gaming,"Kind of surprised I've only purchased 3 of the UE4 games on that list.

gaming,“Grandpa! Grandpa!  Tell us about how Infinite Warfare ruined everything!”
gaming,"As a bus driver, this is my dream game."

gaming,Just so you all know the dude on the left is the President of the United States who gets caught in the blast of a nuclear missile on his way to address the UN. He then wakes up in a fantasy world and starts popping bitches with his 9mm. I don’t know anything else about this game beside that intro but it’s up there with the MGS V opening as weirdest in gaming.
gaming,"Omg, it's a speedrun?
If it's  a speedrun, that cooler than pray speedrun :3"
gaming,So what do people mean? You have full body expressive avatars. You have haptic gloves. You have a physically reactive world where you can do all sorts of crazy things.
gaming,"&gt; A screenshot or link to this has been posted multiple times a day in this sub since this happened

gaming,I don't know who asked for this but I'm very glad they did
gaming,"&gt;  Wearing a screen on your face is never going to go mainstream.

**Why** though? People don't really think this through when they say that. As far as I'm concerned, VR and AR will be a part of everyday life in 10-15 years."
gaming,It's actually Jameson (not white wine or flat beer) the coffee cup has Maker's Mark in it they are la Croix and the douche in the burgundy sweater was drinking his last Croix in a martini glass lol
gaming,That's a completely different game.
gaming,Yes clever... twist on the end there...
gaming,Now that I actually think about it. It's happening soon. Think abkut it. They've been in the early atari stage of games for vr. Theybe been getting better and better. Pretty soon we'll get a polished VR battle Royale. Which would be alot like ready player one
gaming,Betcha that full support and updates thingie will change in 6-12 months.
gaming,"&gt; but with a bunch of toxic incel undertones and elitism

I never picked up on any of that.

There's nothing wrong with that"

gaming,I'm starting to think we were all 12 playing this! 😂
gaming,"That's not a very good question, kappa."
gaming,"I stand corrected.That is definitely very interesting. I'm wondering how it deals with situations like putting your hand through a wall, picking up a heavy object, or holding something with two hands."
gaming,What will happen if you already own it?
gaming,"""Nice tire changing grease monkey!""  Damn... I played this game so much when I was a kid."
gaming,"I just finished the first one for the fifth time an hour ago. Onwards to the second one. The series is fantastic except for the ending. Far as I’m concerned, Shep and Garrus have retired to some beautiful backwater planet with their adopted kids."
gaming,Should call this game Virtual Anxiety
gaming,"Mine has a ""family fun center"" 🙄 Same purpose."

gaming,Hit with that deep nostalgia. This and hotwheels was my SHIT
gaming,"I loved it too, but I am uncertain if I would enjoy it as much a second time. ME2 and 3 has worse RPG elements, but much better gun play"
gaming,I can't imagine how slow it will get once someone gets up to a hundred buses or so
gaming,A wonderful set and a nice way to remember your father.
gaming,How do I play this?

gaming,Love your website btw!
gaming,wait isn't the Nintendo the only system? my dad told me this it has to be true
gaming,"Yeah. You need to look into steam a bit closer, it’s filled with malware"
gaming,I could make a Grookey! My commission schedule is booked atm but we can still discuss details in the meantime if you're interested
gaming,I need to pay hundreds of dollars so I can pretend to play with a ball
gaming,"I am not, I have done it! Games can withstand split screen multiplayer, they can do that too. Rendering for small mirrors can be a low resolution, and with more modern engines can do res scaling, too! It used to be a big deal, but it isnt anymore, especially for things like car mirrors in racing games, because you generally dont have a lot of things to keep track of (like projectiles or npcs)."
gaming,Valve Index and Boneworks will be groundbreaking
gaming,"Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten.

A dumb quote that used to be in back at my old job.  However, I can say that I dont recall what I paid for The Stanley Parable, but I played it for a few hours that day, a few hours the next, and that's it.  It is still one of my favorite gaming experiences of all time.

Guess the quote is right, despite being kinda dumb."
gaming,"I rock the other two versions in Titanfall 2
R301 looks just like them."
gaming,Still can't believe it. Forced to uninstall and blacklist my most played and favorite game. Devastating.

gaming,All the time you have to leave da space
gaming,Hehe well this won't be out for a while so it won't help you but may be you could check snakeybus which is on the top of gaming at the moment
gaming,"Thanks. I was thinking like an actual place where you can climb ladders and stuff, but that certainly is amazing as well."
gaming,"Over dramatic that someone is removing a game they used to like bc they don’t want epic to EA them and cause micro transactions to be shoved in your face. I don’t think it’s over dramatic, countless games have been ruined over shit like this, you know epic will abuse it and will try to be the next EA."
gaming,It's a serious question. I'm not here to fool around. If you know the answer it would be good to know if not then just don't answer.
gaming,"It won't physically stop your whole hand unless they extend the exoskeleton out to your arm, but you can have a physical model for your virtual hand. Combine that with the textile feeling of the wall and you will naturally not let your hand go through, unless you are deliberately trying to break things - but it wouldn't have any in-game affect because physics would stop the virtual hand, so cheating would be off the table still. 

Heavy objects can be simulated at least a little with visual trickery, and haptics will no doubt help by applying some pressure. 

&gt; or holding something with two hands.

Can't say much about that though."
gaming,It’s the most innovative shooter I’ve played in years!
gaming,I would recommend buying it now. I'm rather cheap but I couldn't wait to play it.

gaming,"I totally wouldn’t expect everyone to pick up on it if you’re not used to seeing it around! I went to college with a bunch of guys like this though and it’s a rampant undercurrent. 

Re: the second thing- the way he words is more like “you’re a REAL girl right?? Like you didn’t used to be a guy and had surgery??”. It’s like the worst possible way to ask the question at all (which. Shouldn’t be asked at the point he asks it either). It was just a super insensitive way to go about it and reads like he thinks trans girls aren’t “real girls”. If he would t want to date one, whatever, but it’s not relevant to the story at all beyond giving the character an opportunity to just say the line. Totally unnecessary in the scene and really a bit weird."
gaming,"Unfortunately, it’ll probably happen by the time I’m old, grey, and too cantankerous to be willing to put up with VR headsets and 7000 cords."
gaming,I feel it gonna happen at the tail end of my lifetime
gaming,"This reminds me of superhot, cool graphics, interesting single-player game, creative, and will give you hours of gameplay."
gaming,RL has voice chat.
gaming,"If you didn't like the first two games, chances are you won't like the third one."
gaming,"It gets especially fun when you realize you can remove things from reality to an extent with pass-through VR. You could eventually do the whole Black Mirror muted silhouette thing but just completely remove them from your view.

Also, real life ad-blocker please?"
gaming,This isn't a GTA mod??
gaming,Be at my place in 30 minutes.
gaming,Can you even slow down the bus?  Or is this some sort of Keanu Reeves scenario?
gaming,"No one is fighting each other. This is about what's best for the consumer and business practices as a whole, which affects everyone, regardless of platform."
gaming,Hopefully real life will be better written.
gaming,"IDK, God of War was a pretty big win."
gaming,Book is way better than the movie
gaming,"In terms of openess and player freedom, how does it stack up?"
gaming,I'm really fucking happy I inspired this masterpiece.
gaming,"Yeah, there's a very important point that we're missing here:

We're now in a universe where we have a company that is doing worse things for gaming than mother fucking EA."
gaming,Would you be interesting in learning coding with me?... lol
gaming,Lol that’s is seriously the best part and if you stand still your guy gets high! The best mission in the game for sure!!
gaming,I do believe if people still play it but counterstrike source has a lot of zombie mod modes with unlimited ammo either wave style game or infection style most maps that play them are usually labeled zr_insertmapnamehere I believe
gaming,"Ah yes, I am making up bullshit. Not the person saying the internet magically cuts off when someone receives a message mentioning Tiananmen Square though.

Do you have a source for any of that by the way? Would love to see it.

Also, I did ask whether you've ever been to China and if you know anyone from there. Care to answer?

Just to make sure, you know, no one is making up bullshit here :-)"
gaming,Oh wow more advertisements
gaming,This is cool and all but this kind of technology will lead to worldwide depression and obesity.
gaming,Please let it be more interesting and creatively fulfilling than Ready Player One.
gaming,"Buy 4 houses on two complete sets or property. Never go for hotels. No one else can compete with you now due to house shortage. When people complain tell them you have a monopoly, the actual point of the game."
gaming,Dude at this point you have to be trolling. It has been proven that steam doesn’t have malware you have done very little research on this whole topic.
gaming,Our kids' school is closing at the end of this school year. Our most likely decision for next year will be an online public charter school. Seems like we're on that path.
gaming,"I have one very similar made of onyx and granite. Got mine in playa del carmen Mexico. You might need to hunt in some of the shops to find one plus it isn't as safe as it was 12 years ago when I went, atleast for americans."
gaming,Gotta dust off the oculus!
gaming,So the one thing i dislike a out this game is combat is punished a little too much imo. Popularity is huge and combst gets negative popularity.
gaming,"I liked 4's campaign.  The only issue for me was Promethean Knights were super spongy on Legendary.

5 handled its plot poorly, the squad mechanic was more annoying than unique in single player, and Warden was obnoxious, but much of the level design was refreshing.  There was a lot more verticality and the few alternate paths that the series hadn't done as much with."
gaming,It took me far to long to see whats going on.... :|
gaming,I thought the Witcher was fun to play but I absolutely hated the voice acting and story.

gaming,I cant agree with you any more its just bad gameplay for me i recently got witcher 3 for xbone and the mechanics are so bad it stutters constantly i think the only good thing about the game is the graphics
gaming,"This looks Awesome! The mirror seems a little unnecessary. It would be reeally cool if you could use the mirror to see from the very back end. Say you managed to chase yourself, you would be able to see the front of the bus from the perspective on the end."
gaming,Well it's not that I didn't enjoy them i just didn't play them. Are there some games you can compare it to?
gaming,Suit yourself. I like the co-op of warface. Fortnite is a base building defense game. It’s pretty laid back and funny.
gaming,"well now its a epic owned studio selling a game for epics console. No different. Both suck. 

I left console behind because exclusives are stupid and I dont want to pay to play online. This is just a dumb move on psyonix's part, and many players like myself are going to stop buying keys and other mtx."

As for Undertale, it's and RPG where the tagline is ""The RPG where you don't have to kill anyone."" It's a truly amazing game that you definitely want to play through more than once. I can't sayuch, because the game is best experienced completely blind. If you're a fan old old style RPGs that have a hint of Earthbound, then you'll love it."
gaming,"as someone who never got into Borderlands (i gave BL2 a second try recently, still think it's boring as shit), i'm confused why you're thinking about getting into BL3.  you don't like the series, and that's totally ok.  just accept that and don't get caught up in hype because you feel like you should."

gaming,"I just did the VOID at Disneyland. Top of the line oculus gear, with a haptic vest, in a large-ish set of rooms that you can move between.

gaming,"&gt; What could Oculus quest offer that you can't currently get on Youtube/conventional screen-based tech?

Actual hands-on experience. Memory retention. More engaging. More social. More adaptive to individual users. More detail. I bet most students would prefer it.

&gt; Do they go to another gathering place where they can be supervised when attending VR school? I don't see how this is supposed to work.

School issued headset. If you don't log in, it counts as an absence. A virtual teacher could also identify people as their avatars too, so you can't cheat the system in any easy way."

I last play a game around 43ish hours ago. Now its says im offline for 2 days. Which is technically not true. Kinda weird. I am interested when it really jumps to the other day, still dont know that tho :/"
gaming,"Exactly. Price now does not matter if technology improves. You can get a TB of HD space now for the same price as a GB 15 years ago. With the TV example our first LCD was $600 for 32"" 720p, and 10 years later we spent less than $200 for a 43"" 1080p."

gaming,Arma 3 has amazing capabilities but a small community and issues with kids scripting servers. The game I believe is way underrated for what it is and how big it is.
gaming,Yeah I feel like maybe I am just getting caught up in the hype but it does seem like it will be a enjoyable game.

A pretty movie, but not a very solid plot.  One of those ""just don't think about it"" movies."

gaming,"If you have a VR headset, I like The Lab. It’s made by Valve, and so has the same quality and humor as Portal, etc. It’s basically a potluck of mini VR games. There’s a Space Invaders kind of game, yet in complete 3D. There’s a very portal-humor slingshot game. There’s a tower defence bow and arrow game. And the last thing of worth is four very realistic national park locations you can move around in."
gaming,That's definitely true. Nintendo has always been better than Sega in most areas.
gaming,It’s a very specific kind of RPG. I’m not surprised people don’t like it. I tend to beat games very quickly so a big game like this is great. I’d still give it a chance though it’s a phenomenal game nonetheless
gaming,Looks vaguely stressful. Lol
gaming,I think society is finally turning around.

gaming,"it was really hard to play for me, I felt like it was more boring and it had less action"

gaming,In 100 years this will be the equivalent of watching a pong match on Atari today.
gaming,Slow but worth it  main thing is side quests are written whereas borderlands or skyrim for example wanted berry fetching quests all the live long day. Took me a few tries to get into it but I enjoyed it to the end once I did.
gaming,whats a noob? is that some kind of Internet lingo? and whats a Super Nintendo?
gaming,Yeah but if updates are only exclusive to Epic store then that's a problem
gaming,No thank you Satan
gaming,"1.	Unless if you are planning to play way more than one game, start with the latest one. Pokémon games have a lot of content beyond the main plot, so just one game can keep you occupied for a very long time. 
2.	I may be wrong, but I believe while all Pokemons can be transferred to a newer game, not all of them can be caught natively. 
3.	Yes. 
4.	Usually the legendaries are different, but other than that the difference is minor. Not an issue unless if you are a completionist. Look up the game on Wikipedia if you want to know the exact difference. 
5.	The elemental type of the starter can make the first gym easier, but once you are past the first gym it should not make any difference. 
6.	Teach them TM moves, or just let then mooch off exp until they evolve. 
7.	I usually keep my starter in my party line up permanently. But like all Pokemons don't use them against an element that they are weak against.
8.	Capture ones that you don't have, and train the cool looking ones. Unless if you plan to play Pokémon competitively don't worry about EV. Even non EV trained Pokemons can beat end game content."
gaming,Are we finally gonna get Half-life 3 now?
gaming,Until epic buys it
gaming,"It was my first boardgame. The rules might be a bit on the heavier side for someone who hasn't played many boardgames before. At its core its just a dungeon crawler, you progress through a dungeon, kill enemies, get loot and souls, upgrade your character so you can kill tougher enemies and eventually a boss.

Some of the movement rules for enemies might be confusing and you'll definitely be checking the manual many times during your first playthroughs.

People often complain about the combat damage revolving around dice rolls, but I don't mind it. It adds excitement."
gaming,W h a t
gaming,"Thank you, the book was clearly the author reliving his glory days and the main character was terribly written to convienently have every skill needed too comical levels, even to the point where he admits there were only like 3 games if perfect Pacman played ever and he out of the blue does it. It was a pretty bad book, the world building was the only saving grace."
gaming,How do i play this right now?
gaming,"It's also filled with Offspring and Bad Religion tracks, great deal /s"

gaming,Steam is by far the least shitty. They're still shitty but they're nowhere near as bad as epic or origin.
gaming,But how are we going to do virtual school shootings &amp; infection from VR unvaccinated kids?
gaming,"Nail on the head.  It's not like the game is going away for people who already bought it, but aside from the fact that what epic is doing is really bad for the industry, they're going to dismember another beloved gaming IP."
gaming,Looks like limbo to me but I may be wrong.
gaming,"The Vale from Prince of Persia '08.  I love overgrown buildings and ruins, and that area had overgrown wooden structures, giant balloons holding things up above a backdrop of cliffs and waterfalls."
gaming,My dad got me one exactly like that when he went to Mexico City in the early/mid 90’s.
gaming,"I agree. Epic really did a poor method of conveying today's news to the public. I also do understand your point of view and why you're angry with them. I just can't find punishing yourself a viable option, since it doesn't hurt Epic the slightest. 

With that said, I do hope Epic pulls their shit together. They are utterly missing the mark to be a true Steam competitor by focusing on the bottom line (via exclusives, and such) opposed to security, features, and making their client worthwhile."
gaming,"If nobody else plays it anymore, wouldn’t that make it frustrating for new person to play? Assuming the best part of the game is the multi-player..."
gaming,Pawns look like stormtroopers
gaming,"&gt;Reply

Open world RPG.  You can choose your class, and evolve more abilities as you level.  The combat is done very well, the story is OK.  It's nowhere near Skyrim, but it's still a VERY good game.  And if you have a switch, it's currently 30 bucks."
gaming,I'm really upset about this.  Is there anything we can *do* about it??
gaming,"Yeah, I worked as a 2nd shift janitor at a school and listened to this on my phone while working.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought man once the big wigs figure out they can save money on buildings and employees when you can just have a vr classroom .... shit will get real.

Then I talked to a guy in the it department ... inner-city kids take pride in breaking computers for some reason. So maybe it's further down the road than one might think."

gaming,Not at the wedding
gaming,You can play against bots. It's free to play.

gaming,"HaptX Gloves, which you see in the gif, have proper textile feedback, the ability to render texture, shape, as well as provide force feedback resistance for your fingers, stopping them from going through virtual objects. It's very convincing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK2y4Z5IkZ0

The teslasuit also offers tactile feedback: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KC83goKZXK8

&gt; Not to mention display resolution and FOV.

That will get much better very fast. We already have examples of displays above the 4000x4000 per eye range and FoV above 200 degrees. Driving that will be a piece of cake for even a PS4 if we just had perfect eye-tracked foveated rendering right now. That will come along in a few years.

There's many many other advancements not shown in this gif that will have a large impact as well."
gaming,"The problem with the announcement is the lack of anyone saying what it means for the continued support for those of us who own the game on steam. Can we still use steam to buy any future DLC once the game is released on the EPIC store? Will steam workshop continue to be supported in future updates? How will client side mod use be affected now since Epic owns the studio? With a sudden announcement and no news these specific questions, it's a bit frustrating. There also is the problem with items and market trading. Currently, each platform is locked into their own system for trades, but with Steam potentially being delisted, how will that affect market? Will the PC trading scene be fractured or will Epic be able to merge all account progression.

So far none of these things have been answered. Of course it may be in the end that the game continues to be sold on steam and none of these problems are a concern, but these are all issues that a lot of PC players value. It would be nice for someone from EPIC or Psyonix to let us know how future changes will affect gameplay."

gaming,"I personally think there are major issues with current and even next-gen VR. I'll admit I've been skeptical from the beginning, but forgive me as I'm old enough to have been really excited when the Virtual Boy came out.   


I don't think VR will become mainstream until they come up with an optical device that isn't two screens in a pair of goggles. The major issue with these types of interfaces is that they mimic convergence pretty well, but not focal length.   


When our eyes look at something in the real world, two very distinct, but synchronized responses occur. Our eyes converge on the point in question, AND each eye focuses at the distance of that focal point. The second action can't be mimicked by a screen that is a set distance from your face.   


This really bothers the brain as it thinks it should adjust focus when convergence changes, and it cannot. This is why some people get headaches or nausea when using VR.  


To be fair, some people don't seem to mind, but I think it's a very big, unspoken issue. I think VR will basically die out, and then come back once a next-next-next-gen optical interface is developed. It will remain very niche until then.   


AR heads up displays will likely become more widespread though. Since having a set focal length for the virtual screen you're looking at is totally fine."
gaming,I'm still waiting for WoW 2 in VR.
gaming,I don’t like it either
gaming,"Calling it a masterpiece is a stretch. It had it's good elements for sure, and it looked amazing, but it definitely had a lot of awkward movement issues and a bunch of questionable design choices."
gaming,"I'm already working on the details. I just need people, and money, for development."
gaming,"Passed the first key though and had untold wealth and money and that was no longer a factor, it was a pretty big cop out honestly. The book was one easy hurdle to the next easy hurdle, with no challenge for the main character. Book was very meh."

gaming,"Which all will never make up for the fact that they sold out to a company trying to make garden walls after the company that helped build them taught them not to.

Fuck epic."
gaming,Doesn't steam itself have a policy of not selling dlc for games that themselves are not for sale on their platform?

gaming,"I got headaches and nausea like instantaneously when I was younger, now it seems to be mainly when I play for longer periods of time (but by that I mean like longer than 15 minutes).

gaming,"Ah Tuesday AND Wednesday, may Thursday be as well"
gaming,"PS4 doesn't come with VR by default. Much like with the PC, you'd need to buy the VR set. PC VR sets are comparable in price.  

You could get a PC with the power range of a PS4 I'd reckon. It'd be a budget system and not be as powerful as a PC could be ('cause unlike the console builders, PCs don't get subsidized by the manufacturer). But even at that, it is possible, see for instance this guide: [https://turbofuture.com/computers/Best-150-200-Gaming-PC](https://turbofuture.com/computers/Best-150-200-Gaming-PC)

Keep in mind that PC graphics tend to blow consoles out of the water IF you use serious hardware, which is more expensive. Otherwise, you'd have to lower your graphics settings to what consoles typically run at to keep the framerate up. IE less or no antialiasing, reduced drawing distance... and so on. The big bonus with the PC however is that it is not just a gaming rig - it can be used for other tasks as well."

gaming,"I'm really hoping they do release it as an engine, similar to valves Source engine coming with all their games. 

Boneworks has the engine and a good tech demo (from what I've seen) but if someone like CD Projeckt, Ubisoft or EA for example could use the engine imagine what experiences they could design."
gaming,Unless that little bastard Albion and his fuckin’ flags are hopping around and take the damn factory.
gaming,That is if epic games doesn't acquire the game and make it exclusive till then
gaming,I forgot what sub this was and thought this was real for a second.
gaming,r/tipofmyjoystick could help you out
gaming,"The combat was not as good as Dark Souls, but still pretty fun to me. Though it's pretty easy even on the hardest difficulty if you just use Quen all the time. I think if you make a conscious effort to mix up which sign you use it's pretty good. I like combat that's based around dodging and counterattacking almost every time.    


The writing felt extremely well thought out, at every moment. There were a ton of side quests in Witcher 3 that were more impactful and interesting to me, than even the best quests in some RPGs I've played. There was literally 0 moments where I thought to myself 'this part of the game is filler'."
gaming,Not to mention the seemingly obsessive take on basically shut-in otaku culture. Glorifying it really.
gaming,"Obesity, how? It would get people more active if anything."
gaming,"The software is more of problem than the headsets, gloves, etc. not to mention the intense graphics in ultra huge environments. VR will be mainstream pretty soon but a practically bug-free immense virtual world like OASIS is basically Sci-Fi.  Even if we had a quantum leap in processing power &amp; graphics who would develop OASIS? EA, Bethesda, Microsoft? 

It's too big for one person but large teams have a really hard time developing fully functional and bug free software. That's not unique to gaming either."
gaming,so normal anime stuff...
gaming,"Oops how could I forget Unreal 2004, spent half a childhood playing that on Xbox. No aim assistance shooters are beautiful"
gaming,I'm totally will to pay like $5 bucks for this shit on switch. Actually I'll say $9.99 max.

gaming,I was pretty young when I played this and I still remember being depressed for the rest of the day when they killed Ghost
gaming,"100% 

The first challenge being a visually spectacular car race instead of a slow methodical D&amp;D Dungeon crawl was definitely a good choice."
gaming,"Great game and very addictive. Loved finishing it. Gameplay, driving, upgrades, characters. All solid."
gaming,"There is a reason Epic had a huge turnover of senior leadership when the company was bought by Tencent, and the reason is they were no longer going to be like that it's time for China overlord profit"

gaming,"All the added peripherals you need to make VR significantly immersive is so expensive and takes up so much room. It's really not viable inside the home. It's maybe viable as an arcade experience, but you would need those arcades to be directly funding the development of games that make good use of all those gadgets. Like, in the tens of millions of dollars."
gaming,"SmarterEveryDay on YouTube made a video on them [here](https://youtu.be/OK2y4Z5IkZ0). I don’t know how credible you will find him but that’s the video I always recommend for them. He also did [a follow up video](https://youtu.be/s-HAsxt9pV4) where he talks with some of the engineers working on them to learn a little more about how they work if that helps build credibility at all.

I’ve never gotten to try them myself but I’m staying hopeful that they’re as impressive as they look."
gaming,I’m wearing one right now ... and I feel degraded!
gaming,"This would eliminate bullying, the need for a dress code, the need to travel, even the need to carry 6 classes of books, 6 classes of notebooks, general supplies and walk around 2 miles a day back and forth to classes...

gaming,They've already confirmed that they will pull it off of steam and not sell it there later this year.
gaming,2 miles is 3.22 km
gaming,Probably won’t here anything about until Jedi Fallen Order gets released
gaming,"At best. Yes. Cheaper is better. See gog and humblebundle for example.

At worst. It'll at least stop alienating potential customers and the related pr damage caused by exclusivity and the stuff they're doing with rocket league.

They'll never cut prices because the EGS is just them profiteering. They were complaining about poor value for customers by steam having a 30% commission on sales on their platform. If that's the case and Epic really care about customers, the prices on EGS should be 25-30% lower. They're identically priced, which shows that it was just a money grabbing scheme by epic for their own benefit, and it shows."
gaming,This is how to damage your own home....
gaming,"Resi 7.  DS3 offers the Dark Souls experience we know and love, but there are few polished games that allow you to be scared simultaneously to keep the headphones on and/or the lights.  You never feel in control, which is the essence of the survival horror genre.  Capcom totally made the fps format work both in gameplay and narrative.  Must Play for any era Resi Fan."
gaming,"On that day they will lose probably 1/2 of their player base.

Then they'll make it free on their store and maybe get the numbers back up, but the golden age of RL is probably over forever."
gaming,If you can jump abover the buildings why not just keep doing that? Prob much easier to win that way.

gaming,I beat the whole main story of Wizard101 before learning you can see what health they're at.
gaming,"I liked 12 better, it's literally star wars but instead of a chewbacca you have a sexy bunny girl. To be serious, I like the plot better, the characters are more likeable, and the combat ,while different, is a great welcome.

As for other games, Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a great choice and even has a pretty good expansion pack, when it comes out get Dragon Quest XI it's great, and as for other final fantasy games 9 is the best of the ps1 games on the switch."
gaming,Is Kerbal an appropriate game that kids could use to learn about real rocket science? Or is it more satirical and less simulation driven?
gaming,"That was 2k’s decision, not Gearbox"
gaming,"That's the thing, nothing about epic is prompting steam to get better. The only thing epic is doing is making people hate them because they are forcing people to use their shitty launcher to play games. Any game that launches on both will sell much better on steam than epic, but epic forces exclusivity so there is no competition."

gaming,"I would say the book isn't that great. As a nerd, it kept me decently engaged... But the plot was weak and everything comes too easily to the main character, i.e. he's a ""Mary Sue"", as they say.

Full body tracking is done by cameras."

gaming,"Who care about this review bombing anyway since the game gonna stop being sold on steam. Also, steam DID take action about review bombing."
gaming,The Last of Us Part 2
gaming,Put this in VR and I promise I will throw up.
gaming,Read again he didnt mention the sales on the damn EGS. He is talking about the 4 games the metro Dev has put out. As when they say it's their highest grossing game. If anyone needs to learn to fucking read here it's you.
gaming,Spent at least two minutes thinking these were curved monitors. I was jazzed.
gaming,They will simply overwork Psyonix the way they overwork their own staff all the while calling them bodies and possibly having them push out a ton more loot box crap than what Psy is already pulling.
gaming,"Yea, strange. Are you concerned someone like a boss or family member is tracking your usage? I’m not sure these systems are so accurate so it’s a bad place to use to hold someone accountable for their time it seems."
gaming,Do you want super ants? Because that's how you get super ants.
gaming,"This is coming quite quickly and better than in this gif.

Do you like or think would like airsoft and paintball? Do you like tactical shooters like R6S, CSGO, Insurgency?

Then prepare for indoor big team physical tactical shooters, 1:1 physical/virtual sync, wireless low latency headsets running 5G straight into a single computer running the whole simulation.

We are talking about an actual video game becoming a sport, a real team deathmatch.

Example of this tech in its infancy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VnQjrZk3rU"
gaming,No way. Where can I find it?
gaming,The Warp is one hell of a drug
gaming,I actually have no idea what you’re talking about tbh.
gaming,I want out of the snakey bus
gaming,They also got in bed with a company flouting anti-consumer practices by bribing development companies under the rouse of supporting developers knowing damn well they won't see any of that grace passed on to them.
gaming,"I really hope RP1 doesn't happen in our lifetime. Certainly not the incarnation that it is in the movie. Is the tech awesome? absolutely. I would kill for a VR world as immersive as that.

BUT.

The Oasis is a Pay2Win shitfest of a game that occupies your entire life. Its ""Live Service"" games taken to its absolute extreme that certainly looks nice and pretty to us in 2019 with our comparatively primitive VR technology, but the permadeath mechanics and the game economy is utter poison.

Getting killed in that game literally causes people to try and commit suicide (and I have no doubt many succeed). The game encourages such horrendously unethical gambling and obsessive habits that people lose their houses and savings over something as commonplace as a death in an online game.

I mean sure its ultimately the fault of the players that they took that gamble and lost, but the fact that such insane risks are even possible in the ""game"" means it is no longer a game anymore, it is a giant slot machine with a skill element: win big, or lose everything, and all that, in the end, benefits the company that owns the game. Gregarious Games is not operating on the disposable income of passionate nerds, it's operating on blood money, and the efforts of IOI to take control so they can plaster everyone's views with advertisements is just making a bad system a thousand times worse... no wonder Gregarious has a team of scary looking lawyers.

Is the Big Bad in the movie an actual good gamer? Fuck no. He most likely BOUGHT all of his gear with real money and then proceeded to roflstop hundreds of players purely because he has the fatter wallet. The places obsession with the 80's is also really silly. Its 2045 for christ sake. There is more than 50 years of missing Pop culture in that universe, billions of potential players and yet noone is a fan of anything produced earlier than the mid 2010s."
gaming,"Technically 5 had forge on PC though, which was a weird way you could play with friends on PC."

gaming,"Yeah right, didn’t notice that"
gaming,"Why are you getting downvoted for stating facts. I hate Epic as much as anyone, but its still true (at least for now)."
gaming,When the fuck is the last time you cleaned it? Jesus.
gaming,"""The store is free"" is a poor argument at best. It ignores several very real problems, not only with the Epic Store in particular, but with the whole practice of non-competing platforms in general - and make no mistake, platforms like Epic Launcher are _not_ competing with Steam. The whole point of exclusives is to ensure that they _don't_ compete. If you want ""their"" games, you have to use their platform. They don't have to offer you a good deal if the lack of other offers makes it the _only_ deal."
gaming,The Witcher 3 is an all time great game.
gaming,Guys I’m looking for some people to play LAN on my Commodore 64
gaming,"the game did look good, but it really just seemed like a watered down red faction guerilla to me, i found it boring tbh, but.............a lot of people seem to disagree with me, it must have something good going for it."
gaming,You really went off on a tangent there.
gaming,"It's a simulator, with a great dose of humor. I feel stupid trying to play it. An online friend of mine is in school to be an aerospace engineer and says one of his profs constantly praises the game and it's accuracy."
gaming,We are in a blessed age for TV
gaming,"It's not happening in anyone's lifetime.

Also I hope it never does.  That was a dystopia my guy."
gaming,I beat Dark Souls 2 without parrying. They changed the timing from the first game and I never learned the new timing.
gaming,You can't reason with the hivemind.. lol
gaming,I just beat Day's Gone on hard. I could have use binoculars to mark targets so I could tell where they were but instead I just used instincts mode.

gaming,I need this right now
gaming,"That’s it we will never be friends, dare I say you are now my enemy"
gaming,my lifestyle is pretty full on and this game has provided me hours of relaxation in the last few weeks.  I found a few streamers that I was able to watch to get hints and tips to be good in the game.  This guy has it spot on
gaming,Get your camera out of my room. Immediately.
gaming,This is such a cool idea
gaming,It's too bad they never made a sequel.
gaming,"Oh boo hoo, Epic still aren't going to get my money and I won't be supporting them. I'm not going to just throw myself under the bus because some other people don't care enough not to."
gaming,Let me know when they figure out mind-machine interfaces.
gaming,its the standard model and it has 1 tb of storage
gaming,Same here. But you need to go back they added stuff.
gaming,"BUT the three games were released before AAA became in love with live services, lootboxes, and microtransactions so I'm not too hopeful/keen on BL3. I hope I'm super wrong and it's the Borderlands that I love."
gaming,"They are removing the game from steam, you will no longer be able to buy it there. That's removal. Though it will still support the purchases before the removal."
gaming,No they did not. They were vague and I guarantee you when this is finalized that will end and it will be an epic store exclusive.
gaming,"I am actually pretty excited for this game, that looks pretty damn fun"
gaming,"What a workout, VR is gonna make people way more active..."
gaming,"Lifetimes are long. Besides, given the rate of progress, 10 years sounds entirely feasible."

gaming,"&gt; One scene involves him literally repeating word for word every line of a character of an entire movie. And he gets it on the first try. I wish I was kidding.

I grew up in the 80's, and we didn't have internet, so we watched cool films over and over and over. I could absolutely, 100% guaranteed quote every single line of certain films. Not War Games admittedly (the film in the book) but I could absolutely do it for the other film in the book (Monty Python and the Holy Grail) and could also easily do it for films Like Bill &amp; Ted and The Goonies.

Besides, he didn't do every single line perfectly. He says in the book that he flubs a few here and there but along the way earns credits for hints, and he saves those up to get him through bits where he forgets the dialog."
gaming,"In Win 10, the OS should natively support most webcams.  The software lets you fine tune and test settings.  At least, that's how my 920 and 930e work."

gaming,Here's an upvote. It came from the downvote I gave the post. I think that's how Reddit works
gaming,I wasn't drunk before watching the video but now my eyes are crossed and im slurring like i had a stroke. I think ill have to pass on this game.
gaming,Getting screwed for free is still getting screwed.
gaming,You can’t really compare the two seeing as they are vastly different games quen is only all that good if you continue to level into it which is for the most part wasteful due to the fact that doing so takes away from combat skills and makes the fights longer the further you are in the game the heavier the incentive to not be a turtle and most of the Witcher combat is based on a counter attack system its just not hidden behind a supper free parry riposte system
gaming,"I don't know anyone with VR that isn't for research purposes (e.g., $20K setups).  If this technology doesn't drastically go down in price, or drastically increase in quality while remaining equal in price, then the VR fad will go the way of the 3D TV.  Such a shame."
gaming,I need this to be in VR
gaming,You're missing the point here. This is server-side. Put those two people at opposite sides of the world and that demonstration would be the same.
gaming,From what I hear they released all game related stuff online as open source so you can build it yourself.
gaming,&gt;If this isn't reposted weekly...
gaming,VR requires an advanced civilization so we probably have 50 good years for VR to mature tops.
gaming,I’m waiting for this one to be remastered. Definitely was my favorite.
gaming,"&gt; It's not happening in anyone's lifetime.

The tech is clearly getting there. It will happen, and it will likely be as soon as in 10 years."
gaming,Dunno how long it was in written form but on the audio book it wasnt but a few minutes.
gaming,"Is fine, it will still be maintained by steam if that's where your friend got it

Also, IB4 /r/woooosh"

gaming,That sounds like a feature not a bug honestly.
gaming,Bro I bought a 73 inch projection TV just to play this game.
gaming,"First of all, play them. At least the second one. But I can’t easily compare them to anything. It’s like any other gun game— maybe Halo— except there’s hundreds of different guns, and the humor is top notch."

gaming,"I'm not the developer, but I've been playing Avorion on and off since last summer, and I'm having a seriously fun time.

Currently game is like $20, depending on where you are, and there's no DLC. The devs started this as a Kickstarter, and they've been working on it for 3+ years. It's still Early Access, and despite that, there's already so much in the game.

If you like space games where you design your own ships, run your own fleets, have your own adventures and factions, then this game is probably for you.

Check it out!"
gaming,"On top of which, I'm astonished he hasn't been sued by whoever owns the rights for The Last Starfighter, because he pretty much just stole that story for his book."
gaming,Fr. Sign me up for some Dark Souls VR.
gaming,I'm getting that harry potter midnight express bus thing vibe.
gaming,I still here the jingle in my head 🥺🥰sometimes. I think the truck building and  the quarry were my favourites
gaming,Hopefully somewhere between now and me ha omg kids I’ll get/make a nice box to put them in lol. As of now the pieces sit in a crown royal bag.
gaming,"Neat trick: I have a save file from the exact moment before the guy calls me as next in line. That way, when I want to make a new character, I can load that save and jump almost straight into character creation. I then save it under a new name and still keep the old starter save."
gaming,1-2x variable. Do u even apex?

gaming,Heros of might and magic?
gaming,"As an old timer I recall at least 2 game industry crashes both seemingly from greed.  The first was the death of the Atari 2600 from overproduction, more ET carts made than the total number of consoles.  The next was the end of the Sega/NES days, forget the reason for that crash (I said I'm an old timer), but it also almost killed off the arcade.

Good news from the crashes, gaming came back even better.  So if it takes a crash to set the ship right, bring it on.

My personal hope is VR is the phoenix that rises from the ashes of all this horrid greed, bringing back a sense of completeness missing from games now."
gaming,There's nothing wrong with only being attracted to and wanting to date a specific gender. Everyone is allowed to be attracted to what they are attracted to. Sexual freedom goes both ways.

gaming,Seriously we really do
gaming,Dwarf Fortress is coming to steam sometime soon. I look forward to your updated graph after you have a sufficient data.
gaming,I did a little research real quick and I believe you could probably get between 100$ &amp; 120$ for it if you sell to a person but if you trade in at a game store you will get less probably around 70$
gaming,This is server-side. You could have those two people at opposite sides of the world and that demonstration would work the same.
gaming,"This looks incredibly fun, but without a really solid mini map, I feel like it would be unreasonably difficult, and not in a good way. Unless its more forgiving than regular snake (ie bumping is ok, lots of shortcuts like that ramp it shows, etc).

One thing is for sure though: I cant wait to try it."
gaming,Ahhh I loved that 😂
gaming,So where do I sign up to download myself into the virtual world forever?
gaming,"Unless you build your own house, sometimes you have to compromise when picking houses with older layouts."

gaming,"&gt;EA, the worst company on the face of the planet :P

That's a funny way of spelling Nestle"
gaming,Now break it. Our worlds aren’t meant to cross with the Twilight
gaming,"I actually have played a ton of warframe recently, i am mastery 5, i find it very hard to learn tho"
gaming,Looks like learning how to connect to all those wow private servers is finally going to come in handy once again.
gaming,"Uhh, datamining? Failure to secure your personal details, saved bank information? Duh?"
gaming,"You would think that they would’ve at least fixed that with how static the game has been recently. Oh well, thank you!"
gaming,If your playing on ps4 and changed your name that’ll do it
gaming,"It’s not happening because as realistic as it may be, VR is lame. That’s probably not going to change until components are cheap enough to make an interactive augmented reality."
gaming,"Not exactly what I asked, but I like to restrict the number and types of weapons I use on first-person-shooters. If I'm playing a WW2 as an American Soldier, I'll only use American weapons. I also tend to favor simpler, weaker weapons, that give me a challenge a make the game more realistic and strategic, such as pistols and rifles instead of shotguns and machine-guns."
gaming,Kerbal Space Program or Stardew Valley
gaming,Yo this looks so cool
gaming,"IF steam doesnt change its pricing politic, it will be a Earlyaccess Indie Hentai Plattform only.
Dont get me wrong...i wont ever Install this Trojan epic launcher ....but they got a point. Early access/ green light is something amacing for small developers or indie teams...

But its something the big publishers are copying smameless nowadys...
Releasing games..marked as finsihed...but in reality its just a graphical high polished Beta.
I cant remember that the Command&amp;Conquer series had to do that....i wasnt an option

All patches of these games were delivered by computer or gaming magazines...once a month...on 1 CD of 700MB.+ a full version of an older game+ new drivers etc etc etc.

As an indipendent developer i would choose epic too....its just more money ill get.

Steam just has too many options for users to compare ..
Users atm playing
Highest peak of players on the weekends

Thats data most publishers want to control and use at their will.
With their own launchers like Uplay/Epic the Devs/Publishers the grey market Key trade can be  controlled and with account bound games the blackmarket/false Debit payments can be extinct."
gaming,"Steam needs to get it's shit together, the store is so finicky with discounts, it's storefront filled with games that are fucking garbage (you notice if you sort by newest releases), last but not least  it now allows adult novel/rpg games that are uncensored, out of control and regulations.
I know that maybe what I'm saying is mostly connected to another issue, but if Epic games with it's pressure on Steam could help fix it, I'm all for it."
gaming,It’s just something that needs to be removed with napalm.
gaming,This is not pre-rendered at all. The only thing that hasn't been demoed by the press yet is the first one as that was just shown today. Everything else has been press-demoed and works exactly as depicted.
gaming,I can't even play Dark Souls *with* parrying lol.
gaming,I can not wait until they have detail enough to learn real life skills and take classes with it.
gaming,"I think you're overstating how much of an issue vergence accommodation conflict is.  Yes it would be very nice to have but it's not something that a lack of which will kill the technology, VR adoption is growing and sure at the moment people who are sensitive to headaches and eye strain because of that issue aren't going to be part of this growth, but there's still plenty of people who can be part of the current growth.

It will probably continue to grow and then we'll get next gen optics and the growth trend will continue, I'm not sure why it would die out at this stage.

You might be interested in this though:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7aviAhxG4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM7aviAhxG4) 

It's a prototype that deals with exactly this issue.  They use eye tracking and shift the lens screen distance to solve the vergence accommodation issue.

I don't think it will be that long before this is dealt with (but I also don't think it is much of an issue for the current market size and rate of growth)."
gaming,I agree haha the clip seems way too fast. Or maybe I’m too slow. Your local bus service doesn’t suck you into the bus through a black hole though? Thought it was standard.
gaming,As long as I dont lose the copy I bought on steam
gaming,"I like to think that Respawn is very dedicated to their lore and the different versions are to explain changing capabilities and features. So when they change it they declare it as a new model just like the M16 a1, a2, a3, etc."
gaming,"I think someone is lying to me so im trying to figure this stuff out but im highly frustrated since there doesnt seem to be much logic in these ""last seen online"" 😔"
gaming,Why can't I come up with unique ideas line this!? :(
gaming,"That's weird, I thought it was way too locked down, as evidenced by the fact that you had to spend money to do anything fun.  If it were a true wild west, people would be making their own planets, not going to Licenced 80s World to chill."
gaming,But can i multibox Rorqs while dicking on nerds in Thera?
gaming,Best. Game. Ever. Well. At. Least. It’s. Pretty. Damn. Fun.
gaming,"Honestly, the Abridged Series is what sold it.  
[https://youtu.be/V6kJKxvbgZ0?t=388](https://youtu.be/V6kJKxvbgZ0?t=388)"
gaming,"Porn is going to make a killing with this.

&amp;#x200B;

 Man I remember back when they talked about the Sex Drive, it was this device that went in where a CD Rom Drive did. One had a male end the other a Female and you could connect through the internet to have sex.

&amp;#x200B;

The instructional pictures they had were amazing. It showed a guy pretty much ramming his computer tower. Hilarious, I wish I could find it to show everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, my point is I wouldn't be shocked if the reason this catches on quickly is because of Porn."
gaming,"&gt; It’s not happening because as realistic as it may be, VR is lame.

Doesn't really sound like you have an actual valid reason? AR is different to VR."
gaming,She's off to a great start!
gaming,"I've been wanting to try VR since the early 80s.  But not enough that I'm willing to gamble on the many hundreds of dollars it takes to simply get a headgear setup.  I might be more tempted if there were demo spots in stores, but I've never seen any.  That just goes to show how niche the VR market is."
gaming,what if i had a terminal illness?
gaming,"I'd call it rated E for sure, and as it turns out making a flat space sim is pretty easy since there aren't a lot of variables involved in orbits.  There are some advanced concepts that the game doesn't account for like life support and multi-body gravitational effects.  However, I'd say that it's probably the best way of demonstrating contemporary space travel in a sim available for like 30 bucks."
gaming,Where can I get this?
gaming,So like in actual Tron movies.
gaming,For pretty much the exact reasons the black chick did in the book.  And nobody can fault them for it.
gaming,"You can do better, you can build your own AI fleet and tell them how to do stuff in a 3-axis RTS style thing, if you want.

Hell, you can even build big ships where multiple players control different parts of it (although I haven't gotten that far yet)."
gaming,"Oh, yea, sorry. I wouldn’t rely on that system. Hope you can find another way to catch this potential liar."
gaming,"I'm going perma, Alterworld style.

Fuck this crippled limb and chronic pain shit and plug me (back?) into the matrix"
gaming,"Destiny 2 or The Division 2 then. I love Warframe but I completely understand it's a giant confusing clusterfuck.

Also avoid Anthem at all costs.

You can also give Paladins a try if you're into games like Overwatch but don't want to pay $50 dollars for it (Paladins is free to play)."
gaming,Is there any way other than audible to get audio books? I want to be able to buy them one off because i dont listen enough to justify a subscription
gaming,"how about remote-access work system, even better! no more commute, no one has to live in big cities anymore unless they want to for some reason, etc etc"
gaming,"Am already dead in real life, whats the worst that could happen? :P"
gaming,"Great post and sums up a lot of the issue.  Most AAA games now are not ""complete"" and users face the challenge of enjoying less of a game than someone who drops for lootboxes/skins/p2w features or the $300 Ultimate Super Good Hyper Deluxe edition."
gaming,I would pay damn good money for a functioning replica that chambered 5.56mm. I'd even get a class 3 just to own a fully automatic one.
gaming,Second life 2: if you can afford to play this game you should just go be batman.
gaming,"It's an old game on Gamecube, but Spartan: Total Warrior, I didn't know that you could switch weapons. During the game you get some new weapons, like dual wielding swords, or a trident, etc. But I thought you could only use those weapons in that specific level. Beat the whole game using the basic sword and shield except for the times mentioned above."
gaming,EA also gave each employee a job offer to work in other parts of EA. I have yet to hear of EA closing any studio they acquire and not offer any of the workers in those studios a job offer in other EA parts of EA. Even going so far as even willing to pay for relocation if it is required for the new position.
gaming,"No physical feedback from things in your virtual environment is a problem.

The film uses that really crazy multi-directional treadmill to get past the movement limitations.

How are you going to feel the texture of your desk? Or feel your back against a wall? Or being pushed by some force in the VR world? Or the physical resistance when pressing against solid objects in your VR world? Walking in a wide open space? walking up steps or obstacles in your play space?

These are things you would expect to encounter in all the situations you mentioned. The solutions are not viable in the home. Games that make good use of all the gadgets you would need to feel actually immersed are not going to be funded by home users."
gaming,At least both your consoles will be fully-functional with all the standard features and a suite of extras.
gaming,This makes me feel good. I'm admittedly pretty pretentious but the summary looked like some Mary Sue shit and I really felt conflicted having written it off but that's exactly what I felt like it would be.
gaming,"It's even simpler than that with the Oculus Rift. It has this thing called the ""guardian system"". When you set it up, you draw a line around your play area, then a transparent mesh shows up in VR to let you know if you're coming too close to the edge of your boundary."
gaming,You misspelled Snow Crash
gaming,"In defense, my counterargument is that the overarching premise of the book was that the world of the Oasis was built around a nerd. Remember that Halliday, the Oasis's inventor had Asperger's.

As someone in the spectrum, I definitely understood and appreciated why Halliday designed the challenges in such a meticulous way based on seemingly irrelevent details from now-relatively obscure games and franchises. With autism, you can become highly obsessed, much like the great scientists but for *all these little things* like the genealogy of George Washington and the love relationships in comic books. Much like a hardcore fan, but with other, social, problems that gets touched on more in the movie.

In Halliday's case and age, it was ~~largely~~ entirely the video games and popular culture of the 80's. Because he was so immersed in the culture and franchises and given his disorder, it made perfect sense to me why he would structure his puzzles almost completely around little details from those games, because to him (just like to me), the act of someone getting these references would warm his heart so much. It would signify that that person shares a part of him, holds the equivalent amount of passion and devotion to something that Halliday acquired in his own life—and perhaps that the person willing to put that time and effort into maintaining the glory and uniqueness of the Oasis.

I could write a lot more on how that relates to Parzival and the Sixers and all, but that's enough to fill a book and it's late. Maybe I'll save that for when I write a formal criticism of the book, who knows. Tl;dr Asperger's changes everything."
gaming,"I understand they are different.

 People don’t want to wear intrusive things on their body. Hats can be annoying let alone fucking graphics goggles."
gaming,"I'm guessing a heavy collision.

\[edit\] Or go under 50mph"
gaming,"If you think steam is not also tracking analytics you are kidding yourself.  Steam has had multiple serious security breaches.  Not sure what you mean by the last one, just like any other thing you buy stuff on (including Steam), you can save your payment information or decide not to."
gaming,"To be completely honest, I'm quite scared."
gaming,Jokes on you I'll be dead before the end of the year
gaming,Now I want to see two forklift operators manage to lift that off at the same time without one of them being out of sync and dropping the car.
gaming,If you really think developers are seeing big chunks of that cash then you are delusional. I doubt they even get bonuses.
gaming,"I haven't played Fortnite in probably a year/half a year, I never played the thing without a friend or too, I despise micro transactions and what EA has done to some franchise.

AND YET, I can see that Epic haven't been total shitheads with Fortnite, Rocket League already has a purely cosmetic micro transaction system and there's no reason to change that, Psyonix was in the gutter at some point and it's only because of PS Plus that they were able to survive so thank fuck they're thriving enough to be able to sell there product to such a giant like Epic.

You people are children and that's a fact (ooohhh LMAO look at that meme dab on Epic amiright fellow dweebs?), insanely pathetic."
gaming,Hell yeah. Been looking for setting different to play.
gaming,"Pff you have fun with your renderings, I'd rather make out with my Monrobot"
gaming,"Yea, I've played it a ton. I always to my unboxing, punching and organizing well before the first game"
gaming,"It is something that takes a little bit of time getting use to, but once you get use to it it's pretty fun to use and exploit."
gaming,Not that I can afford it but that's far less than what I thought it would be
gaming,"I do have a friend that has been helping me out with warframe but he doesn’t have a pc, i will probably just stick to playing on console for the time

Overwatch and Paladins are those games that i keep going back to for no explicable reason, even though i am terrible and the games and are not very enjoyable for me"
gaming,"No, we can’t agree"
gaming,"I could have assumed that. A 4K sq ft house is not cheap. At least in my area it’s probably a 750k+ home. Anyone with a china cabinet is most likely old. The chances of them to be into VR and Reddit also slim. Unless they worked in tech and had some weird obsession with their grandmothers china cabinet lol. No snooping required.

Just don’t think it’s fair to downvote someone for being well off, and that’s coming from someone with like.. $10 bucks in the bank thank god tmr is pay day lol."
gaming,At this point you’re just defiantly misspelling the word
gaming,"Abzu. Red Dead Redemption 2, when you turn off the HUD. Racing Games relax me, especially Dirt 4. And maybe Super Stardust, but that can get gratuitous.

Calmness comes from within, when the realization that outside factors are just that."
gaming,"Try me, ordinary human"
gaming,"Absolutely! I volunteer in hospice care and I've thought about purchasing an Oculus Go (doesn't need a computer, can bring it around and just play) to bring along with me for my patients to play with. Even something as simple as hopping into Google Earth and being able to stand on the street you grew up on could be an incredibly meaningful experience to someone older."
gaming,Destiny 2 or The Division 2 it is then lol.
gaming,I love how Boneworks was featured in this montage!
gaming,"No, it's just because it became trending when your generation as kids pioneered the gaming consumerism. It's now locked in your mind as a fond memory, tied to nostalgia. It's only classy to you. And similarly, the same thing will happen with current mayor trends. I am certain Fortnite will be remembered in a similar fashion and in fact, if and when the servers close it will be remembered as being greater than it is. 

Similarly to how I fondly remember Blacks Ops II Zombies when the zombie craze was at its peak, until the hackers ruined it. Looking back logically, it was riddled with glitches that I abused that made the game fun and without them, what's left? Just running around trying to not die for as long as possible?  Thinking of it now it'd just be anxiety inducing and kinda pointless. 

BOIIZ was the same era as Minecraft and I feel the same about Minecraft. It's just not my pot of soup. It's not a ""classic"" or ""classy"". At least not in my opinion."
gaming,"that's about what I thought it would be, should have bought a PS4 n the first place! Thanks for the help!"
gaming,Then you are arguing on a subject you do not understand and admit yourself lack knowledge. That makes you a fool.
gaming,Are you talking about Life is Strange
gaming,Yes but at the main feed
gaming,They see the light but aren't sure where it's coming from.
gaming,"The least believable thing was that nobody else had tried going in reverse before. When I watched the movie the first time (hadn't read the book) I literally said out loud ""wonder what happens if he goes backwards, its supposed to be a VR city the track is probably not the best way to get to the end"" 


My little brother who both read the book and watched the movie looked at me like I was the biggest fucking asshole on earth because his gf that was there with us also hadn't seen it."
gaming,"AR is meant to be wearable.

And people will adapt something if a) it's comfortable enough and b) there is value.

Both VR and AR will tick those two boxes as they develop.

3D glasses never had much value. VR/AR has more value than really any devices we've invented."
gaming,"But, they've recommended 42 games..."
gaming,No shit. Multiplayer VR over a network is not new or revolutionary.
gaming,Yes! Damn you were quick thank you!
gaming,Definitely Life is Strange
gaming,Would that be cheaper or more expensive than buying thousands of acres and planting a forest
gaming,"I think it might be the tracking without as much information because of the headsets in the way, if you look at this video from 1:18:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86-tHA8F-zU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86-tHA8F-zU) 

The real vs rendered comparisons look pretty much identical, slightly softer for the rendered version but that's all really.

They don't look uncanny there I think because they are having more of their face accurately tracked because they don't have a headset in the way.

This might be something that is solved with better software for plausible face animations from more limited tracking data."
gaming,A game where you can win twice? Where can I preorder?

gaming,"Sometimes with things I think “I shouldn’t mock, someone clearly worked very hard on this” but not here. They clearly fucking did not."
gaming,"People put it on such a pedestal, as if it was going to change the future. I couldn't believe how much hype it got for being a character that just tumbles through everything without an issue until the book finishes *exactly* like you know it would."
gaming,I see that one of your opponents is so confident in his strategy that he is asleep.
gaming,This game looks insane
gaming,"Oh wow, that's so cool!"
gaming,Thought this was a GTA mod for a sec
gaming,"Understandable, but if you're essentially giving access to the first key to a schoolkid who may or may not have much (fighting) experience in the rest of the Oasis—remember some kids got their equipment on scholarship like Wade—I think it would be beneficial to maybe give them a bit more help and protection, considering how everyone from your stranger's cat to god-tier PvPers know who you are now... right?"
gaming,Do you “collect passengers” by hitting them with the bus.
gaming,Never played it nor heard of it
gaming,Why wouldn’t you just play soccer
gaming,"Thank you man, I have bought this game."
gaming,Have I answered your questions and provided good customer service?
gaming,"&gt; No physical feedback from things in your virtual environment is a problem

The gloves provide this. They stop your fingers from going through objects and provide texture and shape feedback.

&gt; The film uses that really crazy multi-directional treadmill to get past the movement limitations.

Only for the rich users. That same treadmill is actually a real thing. Most OASIS users moved via gestures.

&gt; How are you going to feel the texture of your desk? Or feel your back against a wall? Or being pushed by some force in the VR world? Or the physical resistance when pressing against solid objects in your VR world?

Gloves handle this for your hands. The Teslasuit can handle the rest to a degree, but again it was always for the 1% of the 1% in RPO. Most users just had a visor and gloves.

&gt; Walking in a wide open space? walking up steps or obstacles in your play space?

Movement, again was gestures for the most part. Basically our methods of locomotion."
gaming,The houses in Texas blow my fucking mind. I used to work for American Airlines and I'd fly out to DFW all the time and the house sizes out there and the prices... Just not fair.
gaming,"You clearly have a strong grasp on what it takes to successfully lead Epic Games and help them become a market leader. You should take your vast knowledge and education, along with your resume, and let them know you’re ready to take the reins and will do it better than they. Lemme know if you get the job. Oh wait...you’re still shy of 18. Well maybe your deep life knowledge gained in that time is enough. Pitch that."
gaming,Dragon warrior and Rc pro am
gaming,"Looks like they also have the Broken Token boxes. They help.

Had a friend 3d print me some boxes to store faction pieces in. Love how clean the game box is now, and when we play, I just hand out the boxes as needed."
gaming,You are either brave or don’t care about your life

gaming,Awesome such a great game
gaming,"When it first came out I beat KOTOR without knowing what the hell I was doing mechanics wise, wasn't into tabletop games at that age. When I started playing a yearlater I remember asking my brothers friend: ""Are we playing KOTOR?"" They all had a good laugh."
gaming,"*sigh*, must be nice having a PC that doesn't suck for gaming."
gaming,"But, it doesn't have Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik. That alone is worth the admission price."

gaming,This gives me anxiety
gaming,It's the best game to demonstrate where the future of VR is going with full body driven physical worlds.
gaming,Correct. It's either resources or workers.
gaming,"I find that specializing in a limited set of weapons makes games more enjoyable for me. I'm the kind of guy who clears entire levels using nothing but a pistol. It is not fun to watch, but I really like it."
gaming,"Additional senses in VR is great, but ultimately, they're only additive - and for most users, there's a threshold that can be crossed where what VR does already capture provides a sufficient value proposition for whatever costs the user perceives (money, time, effort, comfort, etc).

The better the hardware gets, the better the software gets, the higher above the threshold VR gets for some users, and the more users cross the threshold (of adoption) for others.

Can you imagine saying no to RPO or The Matrix grade VR, just because you can't say... smell and taste food in there, while everything else is present? Or avoiding it because you can't feel airflow while driving a car? Or sitting in a virtual theatre?

If you've adopted, then the lower quality will simply mean that you will still seek real world experiences - which to me doesn't seem like a terrible thing at all."
gaming,I watch YouTube videos of it all the time because I don’t have a pc :(
gaming,"Back in the 90's when VR got popular with Lawnmower Man and the Pterodactyl game, I always said VR was going to be the next big thing. Now almost 30 years later it's finally getting there after multiple times. I'm still worried it's going to be too addictive and cause health problems (people not eating, obesity, mental health). It's too easy to want to give up reality for a fantasy world where you can be anyone and do anything. Still, I'm really looking forward to it. Of course, now I also see a lot of educational things. Walking on the Moon, Mars, Titanic, ancient Rome, historical events, etc..."
gaming,I've only played it in VR and somehow didn't like it that much. But I don't like most shooters anyway. The only recent shooter I liked was strangely enough RB6 Siege because I don't normaly like realistic shooters.

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: Since this is a dick waving contest for Epic, if they wanted to take the game out of steam I say Valve should let it go. Epic is already disliked but that would be a huge mark against them to do some bullshit like that. Psy shouldn't have made this move in the first place."

gaming,"Most technology that grows at an exponential rate is because there is an easily seen need for such a technology and there is money to be made at every stage of development that can be put back into development. Video games seem to work perfectly fine as they are and until the technology is complete there isn't much money to be made, as you can't sell each step and devote the money made back into it as research funds. And when it is done, who knows what it's going to be. When the airplane first came out and people imagined everyone jet setting across the world, I doubt they imagined the experience of being crammed aboard a commercial air liner.

Compare that with space fight, unlike planes in which billions of people constantly need to go from point A to point B, there really isn't much of a need to go into space and most people who saw the moon landing died long before the space enabled future they most likely imagined on that day. Due to lack of need half finished space exploration with which to sustain itself progress is... slow. Even SpaceX, the ""pioneer of space travel,"" is still using a scaled up version of the liquid fueled rocket invented in 1926."

For a VR system that delivered an amazing experience it shouldn't be too much of a barrier to entry. No way I'll wait a decade to try it, I'm just waiting for good games and such to be widely available for it."
gaming,Add Patch Bakk for Fortnite and Apex
gaming,.....it’s the technology that is the point it’s s basic version of what it can actually be. Precision timing instant feedback and the list goes on with that simple little demo.

gaming,On-line shopping works well for me.
gaming,"&gt;  I'm still worried it's going to be too addictive and cause health problems (people not eating, obesity, mental health).

I'm sure people will adapt to eat and drink in VR as you'll be able to see it by scanning it in via cameras on the headset (in real-time), and you should be pretty encouraged to get active using the tech too."

gaming,To have good VR you would need to intercept the nerves directly and input something entirely different like in the Matrix or Sword Art Online. We are still way off of having good VR systems.
gaming,"I dunno man. I did all the achievements in Witcher 3. Which includes playing the game on Death March difficulty, and also fighting all of the Von Elric nightmares at the same time. It always felt like I could trivialise any of the difficult stuff by just refreshing Quen whenever I got hit.    


Also I think it's fair to compare the combat systems. Dark Souls is the standard at which I judge how satisfying combat is for most games. Witcher wasn't *as* good, but I still think it was good. Story is obviously where the game really shines though."
gaming,"I'm sorry but it was MW2 that was the *magnum opus* of Call of Duty. The character control, the guns, the perks.. It was the perfect storm. Multiplayer was perfectly balanced imo and the campaign was great. I am a bit biased as that was my foray into CoD."

gaming,I actually have one of those and they're amazing in the summertime.
gaming,"I'll repeat my initial comment:
&gt;All the added peripherals you need to make VR significantly immersive is so expensive and takes up so much room. 

The things you say are just for ""the 1% of the 1% in RPO"" are the things you need to have a significantly immersive experience in VR. And I doubt a glove is going to be able to stop you from moving through physical objects in the VR world. It may be able to provide some haptic feedback but even that won't simulate something as simple as gun recoil in a significantly immersive way."

Not really. You can get perfect visuals, perfect audio, perfect physics, convincing touch for your hands and resistance for fingers, as well as temperature. That will very likely be enough to induce presence very often. People are already immersed today despite having 3x less field of view than what we can achieve, 500x less resolution, no where near realistic audio, no photorealistic graphics, no realistic full body tracking for sense of self, no haptic gloves, no variable focus. Put those in and it will feel nothing alike."

gaming,Go to a board game store.  Good ones have a bunch of tables to play on.  People are always happy to find new players.  Talk to whoever is running the place about your situation.
gaming,Steam is a monopoly. But hell yeah I am.
gaming,"We're never gonna be able to physically replicate those sensations.

I think if we ever get there it'll be as a result of mentally replicating them, tricking your neurons into feeling things that aren't there."
gaming,"Just play the Tron Evolution game, came out after Tron:Legacy, lightcycle battles were pretty great, I played the hell outta that."
gaming,"I'm kinda bummed Goat Simulator got so popular because it was just kind of a silly meme game, but the same studio made Sanctum, which you never hear about, and that game is really good!"
gaming,Is it a PC game?
gaming,That is the one word I spell wrong every time without fail. Pisses me off to no end.

gaming,Mordhau is great. Are you in the discord?
gaming,THIS IS SO FUCKING COOL
gaming,I don’t see how they overcome the moving through space issue. Standing still maybe.
gaming,Skyrim is my kerbal. MW2 a close second.
gaming,"I imagine it will, but it's probably not a priority for EA considering TF2 was a failure, while Apex to my guess is making quite a good bank."
gaming,"No AR is not meant to wearable. VR is meant to be wearable. Virtual meaning virtually everything you see is processed and rendered. Augmented as in the world around you has been artificially augmented. Hense the VR headsets, and the AR features on your phones."
gaming,It is probably more expensive but at least it would save all the fully grown trees.
gaming,"By the time it is a thing, a space the size they have there will be 20,000 USD a month to rent.

Hell, it probably already costs at least that for that kinda space in New York. We need to solve the room immersion and physical space problem in a consistent way across VR platforms."
gaming,It’s on PC but was originally for NES? I think.
gaming,Readying for our inevitable life inside the matrix?
gaming,And you know this because?
gaming,"For the fantasy world atmosphere. Games like these are for people who like staying there as long as possible, exploring every corner, not for those who want to get through the story and move on to the next game."
gaming,yes very helful and amazing in summer
gaming,i usually just play spider-man
gaming,I actually liked that it wasn't a 1:1 adaptation.
gaming,Basically every game that comes with cheat codes...?
gaming,Hey I’m sorry but is there a higher quality version of this.
gaming,"Shoot honestly if I could find it I’d give it a shot. May be outdated, but I’m down to try out different games"
gaming,"System Shock 3

gaming,"After getting a PS2 (You dont need a PS1, the PS2 and PS3 can both play PS1 games) I'd say youre all set"
gaming,"GoG, Microsoft Store, Origin, uplay, Itch.io, Green Man Gaming, GamersGate and Humble Store say otherwise."
gaming,My guy epic has exclusive yes it’s a free LAUNCHER meaning it’s the thing that has the exclusives that you buy
gaming,Looks extremely chaotic. Sounds amazing.
gaming,"More money to work with?  At this point, how many sales are they looking at?  It's not a new game, if it hasn't approached its saturation point, I'd be surprised.

I don't like that the only defense being given for these moves is ""money.""  Exclusivity deals for software that all runs on the same OS/HW are anti-consumer.  Greed is bad."
gaming,Theres no way i wouldnt crash almost immediately
gaming,It doesn't even need a texture pack. It's already the best game ever made. I don't care what anyone says.
gaming,"Edit: video of those gloves explained, they also let you feel.

gaming,U just got a follower
gaming,"Yeah it got a PC port in 2018, it might be on steam or something."
gaming,Using the Virtual Boy as a criticism of VR is a clear indication that you are wildly out of touch with the current state of VR
gaming,Some people dedicate their lives to crime... so you’re living the life!
gaming,Yeah but our dystopian world is dying because we're fucking off in real life.
gaming,Their market claims are a joke. Dont even try to pass those off as legitimate rivals to steam.
gaming,"Or it will be: ""Really makes you feel like a bus, 8/10"""
gaming,"This is where I am at. I am not expecting to go get this shit next year. But in 10 years? Yeah this could be a possibility, and that is what excites me the most."
gaming,I want to be that kind of old man in the future. The kind that actually has an audience that actually cares about what I'm saying about the past. Things they couldn't possibly understand because of how they world works now compared to back then.
gaming,"Glad somebody else said this, I was going to agree as well.  As a child of the 80s we didn't have the internet, so watching a movie so many times you could recite every single line, literally, wasn't a completely insane concept.  I can pretty much recite Breakfast Club and Monty Python and the Holy Grail and a couple of other similar 80s movies almost line for line, and I wasn't nearly as into movies as many of my friends were.

&amp;#x200B;

There was a big Mary Sue element to the book, but the trip down memory lane from reading it was nice.  At a few points I was like ""THIS IS SO AWESOME"" then I realized most people who didn't grow up in the 80s would really have no clue what the fuck is so neat about this stuff and aren't enjoying the book the same way I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I loved it, want to read it again soon."
gaming,That dude looks like a cross between Cronk from Emperor’s New Groove and Markiplier.
gaming,But none of those games are dead.
gaming,"So I have a couple of explanations and one of them is correct but I don't know which. The way you unlocked it was 50 achievements and 1000 gamerscore. However when I got it, there were more than 50 achievements and around 1500 game score available. I THINK I got it through that without unlocking the achievement yet.

OR

I used to mod a lot, I was the first person to mod recon armor in Halo 3 successfully, have it stick online, and had never owned ODST (at least at the time, its my favorite halo now.) Well anyway flexing aside I probably modded my gamerscore/achievements but did not unlock that achievement. I can promise you one thing and that I definitely got the achievement on that kill because I honestly wouldn't have known otherwise."
gaming,"Yeah, I got other priorities at the moment, like making sure my 19-year-old car doesn't fall to bits, losing 40 lbs, and getting a job so I can pay for both health insurance and car insurance."
gaming,He opened a zipper and found keys to a brand new car!!!
gaming,"Thank God, no anime eyes!"
gaming,All the big AR companies are chasing wearable AR. They are using mobile AR as a temporary stopgap. AR's potential is extremely limited on a phone compared to a wearable.
gaming,So no different than how it is already?
gaming,You've obviously not played Eldewrito.
gaming,"RE7

DS3 is a great game, but is suffers from being more of DS

while RE7 is really something fresh at least in the franchise, and it seems like if u have VR, RE7 is a must have"
gaming,Damn it’s so bad that Outerworlds has been forgotten.
gaming,That's the same glove.
gaming,Why haven't they made a remake of Crazy Taxi?
gaming,"The non-removable film grain on PS4 really hurt my last attempt at a replay. Didn't even notice it on my tiny TV when the game came out, but it's hella ugly now."
gaming,Why do you think they have it caged off?
gaming,Diglet has never been the same since Hiroshima
gaming,Activision and EA are on the same shitty level. Bethesda lately has been is on the brink of joining them. Epic is doing the exact same thing
gaming,"Is Steam a monopoly or is there not a ""legitimate rival""?

It can't be both."
gaming,That’s the second time I’ve seen someone say the left looks more like a hedgehog and it baffles me.
gaming,"Nah yer right, mate. Epic Store throwing money around for exclusivity deals for a whole bunch of games or just straight up buying companies to remove them from their competitors is in no way unlike a monopoly itself.

If they could could be in Steam position you can bet your ass they'd jump at the chance. At least Steam provides a better consumer service. 
But hey, I guess it's just a circlejerk because most people think the same thing."
gaming,Not all of us pretend to be 93 year-olds :(
gaming,The goggles. They do nothing
gaming,"It's sad that this is how they decide to earn more money.  In the old days, companies would release new games or DLC."
gaming,Drop the EA. Just skate 4. Sound cleaner.
gaming,Dark souls the musical.
gaming,Is this that old Ski game that came with Windows?
gaming,"Sure, but VR definitely has a greater foothold now than it did before. Three major headsets are releasing in the next one or two months alone."
gaming,"I have used an application like this... In a bar whilst pissed out of my head. 

You could bring up walls around you for a private work area where you can throw your emails at the wall etc or lower the walls and look around like you're in an office."
gaming,Crap you are right :p
gaming,Dudundundadun dudundundadun dananadanana dudundundadun
gaming,Ya know it would make a lot more sense to have the cord attached to the ceiling for scenarios like the VR soccer one. I feel like tripping could be a huge hazard.
gaming,"This is a very shallow competition. Jim sterling has a good video on it. But Epic is using anti competitive actions in order to replace Steam. They are trying to force games off of steam by throwing money around. This prevents any choice for consumers. The choice btwn stores is tied to the choice to buy games. If we like Steam more than Epic but Epic has a game steam doesn’t (because it’s exclusive) consumers are forced to give Epic money. 

Now in house exclusives would be alright, but third party exclusives are nothing short of a one company subsidizing a game for their benefit."
gaming,"It will get faster. My friend and I can usually finish a 2-player match in under an hour now. We finished one in about 35 minutes with the alternate victory conditions from the second expansion.

BEST. BOARD GAME. EVER."
gaming,Finally bring better education to rural people. Important they get fiber internet.
gaming,Nope not enough.  You're gonna have to think bigger to make up for that abomination you've plagued us with.
gaming,Obviously you've never played The spongebob movie video game
gaming,"You start with a 3d model you (or your team) has created, then you add a skeleton of sorts to it, which results in an animation rig made of things like deformation bones, a muscle system, corrective shape keys. From there, you would import mocap data, and through various means attach data gathered from control points from the mocap setup to the deformation bones of the rig. From there it's all clean up work."
gaming,Multiplayer? VR? Now that would be awesome!!! :D
gaming,Bonus points because this is the 2 glove version.
gaming,An evolution gone wrong
gaming,That's just twisting words. Steam is an excellent  example of a monopoly.
gaming,"In 2016, the cost of entry was $800 for a complete Rift or Vive setup, on top of a beefy enough PC to run it, which let's be generous and say would cost $700. The *cheap* option was a $400 PS4 plus a $500 PSVR setup.

This month, Oculus is releasing the Quest. It's a standalone VR headset, but unlike other standalone headsets, this one's true VR. Proper 6dof movement, motion controllers, the whole thing. It's $400, and you don't need to buy anything else. And if you want the higher end VR, you can get a full Rift S set for $400, a full Vive set for $500, or a PS4 + full PSVR set for $650.

I think going from $900-1500 to $400-1200 is a pretty solid drop for just 3 years. Imagine where we'll be by 2022."
gaming,I don't wanna sound like a dick but that sounds like Don't Starve just in that one sentence
gaming,What if you got your rocks off knowing that the dude gets his rocks off to you getting your rocks off to him rocking off to you?
gaming,"Buying developers now makes companies a monopoly. I guess every large company is now a monopoly. Also I find Epic to be more user friendly and they give more back to consumers, creators, and developers. You just don’t like it because it’s new"
gaming,I feel like I'd enjoy this right up till the time I get motion sick and puke my guts out.
gaming,I'm down for ready player one as long as it's not the movie
gaming,"I really liked it.  Good story, lots of cool twists.  Solid story-driven shooter.  I give it an 8.9/10."
gaming,NO ITS MINE GIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIM.E
gaming,The only sad part is i dont see them being something we will have at home. At least not in a while.
gaming,But the motherfucker has hair. How did he sacrifice it for good if he's got it back again?
gaming,What if you run into the wall? Happened to me while playing PS VR.
gaming,It’s common sense I don’t need to know it because it’s obvious to anyone who has a brain
gaming,not only that but at least with the sims 3 if you bought it on steam they would let you use the key to download it for free in origin instead of making you buy it new again.
gaming,I'm 53. HURRY THE FUCK UP!! I WANNA PLAY!!
gaming,"&gt;It's in Albanian.

It's still doing it's thing today."
gaming,"I don't think you understand what ""monopoly"" means. Steam does not have the exclusive possession and control of the PC gaming market."
gaming,But if they weren’t doing these exclusivity deals nobody would give them the time of day. This is what they have to do to make themselves viable in the industry
gaming,"Played the demo, had a great start. But after 15 minutes I was already bored."
gaming,"I see the ""pretend you find a videogame in a car"" karma mines aren't dry yet."
gaming,You couldn’t be more incorrect. Wearable AR is already a thing with google glass and Microsoft hololense. But there is still a distinction between AR and VR.
gaming,"You're technically correct, but that was not what I was going for :P"
gaming,My body is ready.
gaming,You might need her boots though
gaming,Maybe you just done like fantasy rpgs? They're def not for everyone.  Imo witcher 3 was a lot of fun.
gaming,I'll give it a try! Thank you!
gaming,Everyone thinks we're all dumb looking now looking at tiny screens all day. Just wait till we're all waving around our hands in front of our faces.
gaming,I feel like MW3 began the downfall of map design in the cod series.  They definitely made good maps like Hardhat but all the iconic maps that were so good they deserved remakes came from black ops 1 and before.
gaming,It's almost like most people think that cosplay is perfectly fine here and those that constantly try gatekeeping here are just a vocal minority.
gaming,"Hated Epic Games from the beginning, still do. Fuck Epic Games."
gaming,Yes it does. It controls over 90% of the PC gaming market. How the hell are you not classifying that as a monopoly?
gaming,Bro what’s the login send me one

gaming,Show me where you're getting that 90% figure from.
gaming,I can't wait!! Where's my Tron bike?
gaming,Oh! Welcome! It is a Nintendo Gameboy cartridge. Its pretty old (about 20 years-ish). Really cool to have one. Its a video game
gaming,"I did try Googleing it but found nothing. I'm just guessing it's ok, lol."
gaming,Hell fucking yeah 😎
gaming,"My point has nothing to do with VR's current state, it is pointing out that is not a recent innovation in any way, shape or form."
gaming,I'd say no. There are way better sci-fi writers out there. Check out Leviathan Wakes.
gaming,"Yes, yes, a thousands times yes"
gaming,[The last video] (https://youtu.be/PcCAlmYDpHE) is from channel Node on YouTube and the game is Boneworks and really looks amazing.
gaming,"No, Google it yourself. Lazy ass."

gaming,"probably with a slightly elevated grade. I'll be the first to admit, my addiction to those flash games did not help me succeed. I know I used them as a crutch for my aversion to discomfort and boredom with my class work but I would have focused better without them. My fault, bot the games just clearing that up."
gaming,Ignoring the stealth aspect of any stealth game.

The P90, like all the other original guns, are unlocked at the same level as in the original. 

There are new guns added as loot box items."
gaming,Ah I see the ''Latina'' part ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
gaming,"I did it... no luck. But, thanks for trying to help!"
gaming,I don't like it because their launcher is trash and how is it better for consumers? So far all they seem to care about is giving more money to companies as an incentive to use their store. You think the average employee is gonna get paid more because of it?
gaming,I feel ya man. I get the night sweats if the soil isn't in a soft and loamy state.
gaming,The one with doors
gaming,"This isn't even the first ""I found an old game in a truck after years of it being there"" post this WEEK. Whether it's real or not, it looks extremely staged and really serves no purpose other than karma circlejerking generally."

Dephynightly"
gaming,I think Zuckerberg tried to do something like this for a hurricane disaster but the people didn't like it that much :P
gaming,Best thing I've seen this week.
gaming,I'd argue that people are not already immersed today. Falling over when they try to press against a fake wall is not immersive.
gaming,Do you understand what an advertisement is?
gaming,I enjoyed the movie because it was almost like experiencing the story for the first time because of how different it was. And the shining scene was absolutely brilliant
gaming,"Did you see the Samantha Bee video about deep fakes where they put Nick Cage on her face in real time and Oprah's face on old Bill Cosby show intro?

gaming,Interesting.... Thanks for that!
gaming,"They already said that their microtransactions will be what Borderlands 2 did.

https://www.pcgamer.com/borderlands-3-will-have-microtransactions-but-only-for-cosmetic-items/"
gaming,"I look through a ton of Steam queues, I spend time looking at their recommendations based on games I play, and I just browse through if I have money to spend. I rarely do, but that’s what I do when I want to find new games. Also, what I was saying about less purchases, it doesn’t matter if every person on the site sees the indie game, if there aren’t that many people using it. I suppose this isn’t true cause of Fortnite, but I just think Steam is generally better. As someone who plans to make games, I am probably going to release them on Steam if I ever do. 

I just find Steam convenient, they have frequent sales on large amounts of games at once, it’s a bit of a one stop shop for buying games, and most of the PC games I know of and/or bought, I found through Steam. 

(I also don’t like the amount of accusations towards Epic for people getting malware from their store, just seems really suspicious, so due to that I’d probably never use it. Just to be safe)"
gaming,"Most likely, the key thing was he washed his face on the mountains, idk why thats the only thing i could remember"
gaming,Lol good luck. No one cares and you'll get down voted or mods will remove it. Or no one cares enough to take you seriously.
gaming,No problem! Sorry it didn’t work! I assume you’ve tried googling to no avail already?
gaming,"There's over 500 zombies in that mill, fyi :)"
gaming,"So is it basically creating that original model to attach the mocap data to that's the bulk of the work? Obviously the rest is important as well, but is the base model the bulk?"
gaming,lol. You're the one making the claim. Back up your claim. Show me where you got your information from.
gaming,I think Node made one of those.
gaming,"It tricked their brain to get to that point, so it is immersive."
gaming,"I don't even play, but this sucks!

F"
gaming,"This reminds me that you can't actually kill everyone in Skyrim like you could in Morrowind. You could even kill Main Quest NPCs. I remember when I killed what I thought was a random person in the ashlands, and an even came up; ""You have severed the strands of fate."" And I got the option to reload or continue playing in a broken world.

Also, I hope they bring back spears in TES:6, argonians just aren't the same without them."
gaming,"Even Valve makes 4.8 billion dollars each year off Steam compared to Fortnite's 2 billion. Unfortunately, they are not doing anything with it."
gaming,"Screenshots and videos my friend! Theyll make it better. And there wont be anything for mods to do. You can downvote it, but I can just repost it."
gaming,All I remember about prey is the alien ships with butthole doors
gaming,"i dont understand, why is porn being thrown around like it's a horrible thing? what's wrong with hentai/porn games? they are just as valid an art form as any other violent or gambling lootbox filled game."
gaming,"Just to respond to your opinion with a different one, I really enjoyed the references.  All of them.  The author and I are close enough in age and had similar likes from growing up, and every reference was a really great, ""Oh hell yeah, I remember that!  Yes, I used to do the same thing!""  etc.

So, I can completely understand how if you're not the target audience, you won't like seeing reference after reference.  But if you do happen to be the target audience, then it was really an amazing trip of nostalgia wrapped up into a fun story."

gaming,Trying to drive like a normal person. Some NPC yells at you. Aww shit.. Here we go again
gaming,"The only real problem with their launcher is that the download speeds are bad. Other than that is on par with if not better than Steam. They literally give out free games, most of which are good. They also give companies back more profit than Steam which is a massive deal for small developers"
gaming,"No, it just takes common sense to know this. I'm not going to back up my claim because it's common knowledge."
gaming,"Okay and like I said, no one cares enough. You're a horrible troll and shit poster"
gaming,"Yeah I didnt really mean to disagree with the posted image. Which i know is pretty much exactly what I did. Just sayin that I'm not really mad about it, as long as we dont have a ""lootbox economy"". I am ok with how BL2 did stuff."

gaming,"I can see what you are saying. I think it’s more the nostalgia aspect as that’s the CoD that really drew me in. Played with coworkers almost every night after work and the wife went to bed.

Black ops 1 was another one we played a lot of as well. I enjoyed that one too."
gaming,I love my Vive. I use it 4-7 days a week. I actually use it the most for working out. And a lot of Pavlov.

gaming,"MW2 will always be my favorite Call of Duty. I remember they had Cliffhanger as the trial mission and I’d play that over and over again until I finally convinced my mom, who thought *video games cause violence har har har*, to get me the full game"
gaming,Looks bad. Would probably look better when mapped to an anime character. Realistic character somehow don't really work in VR at the moment because it's doesn't look even close to realistic. That's why anime characters probably work better because our brains don't expect realism there.
gaming,The way I remember it is de-fini-tely
gaming,"IGN gave it an 8.  

Anyway, it's a great game. There's a segment towards the end that soured me a lot, but overall I really liked it. Try out the demo if you're unsure, it's pretty meaty."
gaming,Who told you that it has multiple security exposures? Some guy on this subreddit?
gaming,"I tried VR at a venue for the first time last weekend, it was a first person shooter against robots in space? I was ducking for cover a lot and I tried to lean on some barricades in the middle of the room while I was crouching and fell right on my ass because they didn’t exist. Luckily it was just me and my two friends in there so I didn’t get trampled. Also walking across a catwalk over a big drop reeeeally freaked me out, I could not walk properly even though I knew it wasn’t real. Wild stuff."
gaming,"It wasn't as broken in modern warfare compared to the second one. Sure the ""commando like"" lunge was strong but guns had so much stopping power that if you died to a knife....you probably deserved it. Mw2 had so many things to buff knifing to ridiculous lengths. Edit: im dumb"

gaming,"Correction. You body is not a thermometer and cannot actually feel temperature. You are feeling the transfer rate of heat rather then temperature itself. That's why metal feels colder then wood, even when they are actually the same temperature. =) And yes, this has been achieved in the lab. They used tiny tubes to carry hot and cold liquid trough the gloves. And because humans are not really precise about where it comes from they achieved convincing results.

gaming,He is but epic games are still pieces of shit
gaming,People will still buy these games and they will be successful regardless of the store they are put on. Another year and the neck beards of r/gaming will be raging about something new and Epic will still be rolling in the money.
gaming,"I feel like low effort cosplays shouldn't be allowed here, I'm perfectly in favour of having cosplay here and I defend it every time but when it's low effort like this it's not really something I can defend, it's just a onesie with an insane amount of makeup."

gaming,🤔 trying to find the point where it loops in this gif
gaming,I played WAY more mw2 than mw1 but holy shit multiplayer was not perfectly balanced at all. The game *enabled* and *rewarded* camping and one man army noobtube classes to the nth degree. You get a 7 kill streak? Thats harriers into chopper gunner/ac130 to nuke. Easy as fuck. It was a great game but damn no fuckin way was it more balanced than mw1.
gaming,"Sure, that's a worst-case scenario. But it doesn't have to be that way, just like AI and robotics don't have to lead to a robot uprising.

Though even if it doesn't get that bad, I can tell you for certain that VR addiction is an issue that we're going to have to figure out."
gaming,"True. I just thought it was dumb. It's like if a reviewer had a rig with a certain graphics card that didn't work well with a game and then blamed the games content on that isn't really fair 

The game overall is good, whether or not *they* had a good experience or not"

gaming,"Out of the loop, why is that bad?"
gaming,"It's all semantics in the end, but what Randy (and tons of other gamers) are thinking is that these single-purchase skins aren't microtransactions because you can specifically purchase a skin if you want, without any lootboxes or currency conversions or freemium gimmicks, which means they aren't technically a ""microtransaction"" and just DLC. It's OK to call it DLC, Horse Armor was never ""a microtransaction"" it was one of the first DLC packs, and people called it such, and this is the same sort of thing.

Like, again this is all semantics, but some people look at any DLC as a Microtransaction, and then there are increasingly specific beliefs here. Most people would probably agree that it's not a microtransaction when a game gives full-on expansions, with raised level caps and new areas and enemies and weapons, but some people would say it IS a microtransaction.

What Randy meant was clearly something like ""we aren't doing that shady shit where you buy currency to spend, or buy lootboxes, we offer DLC purchases straight up like we always have and that's the end of it"". Borderlands 3 isn't going to ask you to spend $5000+ on random/rotating already-in-game items like MK11 does with it's currency system, all Borderlands 3 does is let you buy a couple cosmetic skins at low prices, and you DO specifically buy a skin, no buying a currency or microtransaction, you pay for DLC and get that DLC."

THERE"
gaming,"I mean Bioware said that about Anthem and we saw how bad they made the grinding there. I'm sure if Bioware wasn't planning on abandoning Anthem they would've introduced MTX to be able to get some better loot and it would've been bought up by those who still enjoy Anthem, but hate the current grind."

I honestly wanna see it though, I’m not expecting it to be good but I’m hoping it’ll be laughably bad, plus it has Jim Carey in it."
gaming,"Hey, thanks! Yeah, it's a pretty crazy story regarding the takeover, but it's a fierce industry.

And honestly, we wouldn't have created Everspace if we hadn't lost our jobs and our IP. So, profit???

But yeah, regardless of where you get the game, the version is the same. The standalone game costs $29.99, the standalone DLC is $9.99, and a CHEAPER package deal of both with some added goodies like the soundtrack and digital artbook (Steam calls it the Ultimate Edition) for $37.47. On GOG, this is the same price for purchasing the whole series."
gaming,"I'm sure they'll change it but you *do* realize that the rocket passes have payed for each other (easily) if you bought the first one from the 10+ keys you earn while moving through each one.

gaming,"This is actually a really good movie based on the video game.

I really enjoyed this."
gaming,"Yet they don't focus on small developers, they pay insane amounts of money to large developers.
It is in no way on par with Steam, as you said the download speeed is bad, it lacks simple features like a basket or user reviews, Steam has a community hub where you can ask questions to other users before purchasing, the friends chat on Epic Games doesn't properly notify you if you've been sent a message and those are just what I can think of off the top of my head."

They really don't sound like friends to me."
gaming,"I did that also but I figured it out after 10 or so hours into the game. Not quite as bad, but still painful"
gaming,Dont know what the hell is going on but I love it!
gaming,No it can't simulate how it would feel like to be someone else. And the VR systems at the moment can't fool a brain. I somehow never really felt that something is real in VR.
gaming,"I'm waiting for the break away ""iPod"" of VR. Like there were tons of crappy mp3 players before the iPod. Even apple had the failed Newton handheld smart device. But it was the iPod and iPhone that became the tipping point. So who's shaping up to be the iPod of VR?"

&gt; And the VR systems at the moment can't fool a brain. I somehow never really felt that something is real in VR.

Yes they can. This is scientifically proven and happens for plenty of people. It's called presence. Right now inducing that feeling is a rare moment, but would be common at a RPO level."

gaming,"I wish people would stop fantasising over this stuff.

VR headsets give the player an extreme disadvantage. Looking around to see is exhausting, using your hands to aim a gun is exhausting. The average video game player is not athletic. It’s not like they can walk around anyway.

Doing anything that requires movement would put you at a severe disadvantage to anyone in the real world who is using a controller. The VR gimmick would quickly fade away after actions that are currently scripted with single button presses become a chore to complete. (Reloading a gun for example). 

Multiplayer would be a nightmare. You’d probably end up having to restrict the use of VR to 18+ games because the amount of guys that would start jerking off with the headset attached would be immeasurable. You’re taking the freedom of real life and combining it with the anonymity and consequence-less world of video games. That’s a recipe for disaster. 

The part where faces are scanned would lead to disaster as the kids who log on immediately get cyber bullied. You’d have lobbies of people opting to hide their faces picking on the people with faces enabled. God help your soul if you’re an attractive woman. 

In real life, video games would be more anti-social than they are right now. You might as well package the people into coffins with tubes following into their orifices."

Also Kotaku just published an article on this game 4 hours ago, just two hours after this post was made. What a coincidence.

Google snakeybus. This reddit post and the kotaku article are the only mentions of this game outside of its store pages, and yet OP has somehow found out about this indie game with ZERO web presence and posted footage of it just two hours before the kotaku article came out. He also took the time to ""talk to the dev"" and let us all know that a Switch port is possible if the Steam version sells enough!

Damn I miss reddit."

If you're mad about the principle of giving a company money because they gave Epic a timed exclusive, you're being a hypocrite for saying you'd even consider buying BL4 in the future when you're saying you wouldn't buy BL3 even on Steam after the exclusivity runs out. Either you should protest Epic and buy the game when it comes out on Steam, or you should protest 2K for supporting Epic and never buy anything that gives them (or Epic) money literally ever again. What you're claiming to do is half-assing it and benefitting nobody, not even yourself."

Hmm ok then it just never happened to me. 

&gt; You have to expand on what you mean by this. Your virtual body can be anything or anyone.

Body tracking would already help to make this better. But you would still have the nerve endings of your own body. To really feel like you are someone else and be somewhere else you would need to have direct control about the nerves and simulate them like in the Matrix.

I was the type of player who could run around the map and die maybe once while getting a good 15 kills or more. Campers were dealt with as a team effort when playing with competent people.

I also dedicated classes to taking out aircraft. Good teams do exist, so those problems can all be dealt with."
gaming,"I refuse to use Epic because within 2 weeks of making an Epic account I had literally DAILY emails about hackers attempting to login to my account, like EVERY SINGLE DAY people were trying to hack my Epic account, and the only thing I had on it was Fortnite, no credit card or money or even microtransactions IN Fortnite.

I used a password that nothing else uses when making that account, and I'm glad I did because eventually someone DID manage to log into that Epic account. I abandoned it completely, and I know I'm literally never touching Epic again, no questions asked. You can all-caps rage about ""but people don't hack your accounts anymore!!!"", but I don't give a shit, I am not trusting ANY of my money or especially not a credit card to any company that can allow daily attempts on my account, and eventually actually let someone besides me into it. In all my years of using Steam I've only ever gotten emails about security issues from my own attempts to login to the account, and even with that Steam now has it's authenticator keeping it locked tight."

gaming,"was just an example...
would like more porn less microtransactions :)
Whole american Violence is ok, tiities are bad is so hypocritical...porn industry is just allowed in Hollywood/Florida/ open water /riverboats....but a Cleveland Accordion is punished by law in Ohio....."
gaming,"Don't worry. They'll remake it eventually. 

I never thought they'd remake the original Star Trek from 1968 but now even the remake is old hat."
gaming,So that's bad lol same way how they get borderlands 3 first. That's bad
gaming,Watch the link for the first 30 min http://youtu.be/4NnGOH_3K9s
gaming,"I sure hope that it works like that. I still have Halo 2 on PC and it does not work well above 60fps.  I hate to be that guy but gotta temper those expectations, I hate being let down. 😪"
gaming,I heard a lot if negative things about it any idea why
gaming,"&gt; To really feel like you are someone else and be somewhere else you would need to have direct control about the nerves and simulate them like in the Matrix. 

You are probably talking about being someone like Neo who can fly and run up walls. I can become a sorcerer just fine without a brain interface. Haptic gloves would convey magic very well."
gaming,I've read both print and audiobook. The audiobook took it to a whole other level. It's one of my fav reads.
gaming,"Bluetooth is still somewhat of a novelty on Desktop PC's, unless the motherboard comes with it, most people don't have it on a tower or desktop style PC, its more common on laptops.

&amp;#x200B;

If the OP is using a USB cable to connect the controller already, there is a solution that doesn't require changing the controller connection type, this type of advice is typically just going to frustrate people."
gaming,The dick physics were unnecessary. Funny though.
gaming,"Everyone in business has an ""agenda"", do we not think Valve/Steam has an agenda for how they can grow their business? Nahhhh they're in it for the love of gaming right guys? The use of that word has gotten so overblown it's just meaningless now. Especially over such ridiculously minor things like this, are they removing my steam copy of Rocket League? No? Wow, what a controversy.  Oh no, I might need to install another client? If I do that my 15 year old Steam account will auto delete, and my PC will buckle under the weight of 100mb more ram being used. The humanity!"
gaming,That movie already came out
gaming,I need more of this.
gaming,"Watch the movie first, then read the book. The other way around would have disappointed me, as far as I can tell."
gaming,Yep. Employee of the Month.
gaming,Reminds me of the Harry Potter bus.
gaming,Hardly. Some of the highest rated games of 2017/2018 are VR games.
gaming,Dragon age.  Holding Alt showed interactive objects in the area. Doh!
gaming,"OH MY GOD, IF WE DIE IN THE GAME, WE DIE FOR REAL"
gaming,People that are not potato cam youtubers?
gaming,People die if they are killed!
gaming,May the odds be ever in your favor.
gaming,I remember running silenced UMP and killing people sniping from a window half way across the map in 2 seconds. The silencer was supposed to decrease damage at range or something but i never felt less murderous with it on the ump.
gaming,"Nah, Ready Player One was a visor, gloves, and a console."
gaming,"You SHOULD like that Steam has a monopoly honestly. Steam takes 30%, but the services they provide to the game devs should be worth that cost, unless you're Minecraft or Fortnite big you're making more money from being on Steam than that 30% ""loss"", even before getting into how that 30% gets you easy distribution and a full platform of benefits and extras for all of your players, free constant advertisement through Steam itself, and a ton of other benefits like a hub for your game and the general use of Steam itself for the game.

Digital services like Steam or Epic are the one place I want monopolies to exist, I want the security to know that in 10 or 20 years the games I bought will still exist because the company still supports the platform, and letting the launchers divide and expand is only overcomplicating a simple thing. Telltale Games has died, and they had their own launcher, which has essentially crashed and burned. That didn't hurt me though, I owned all my Telltale games through Steam, and they all still work fine and even if my computer is stolen I can boot up Steam and redownload my Telltale games through it. Having 10+ launchers for all the different services is just increasing the amount of time you waste actually getting to the games you want, increasing wasted space on your computer, increasing the chances your data and information is hacked/stolen (which I see is a big problem with Epic accounts), and most of all reduces the chance all your games will last forever as with so many smaller launchers eventually some will fail and die, taking your digital backups of games with them.

They will never do a combined launcher because it doesn't work, it requires all these companies to not only work together, but keep each other alive, and that's not possible. We've already seen games launchers die, the Telltale launcher is a great example where I COULD have been out literally hundreds of dollars if I used it, as I value my game purchases by whether or not I can redownload them on all future computers I get if I want to, and if I used the Telltale launcher I'd never be able to do that with my large collection of Telltale games again."
gaming,At least you have 10 dollar bucks
gaming,Honestly would rather this than what we got
gaming,I get this. I also like to go into the nature. My problem is that I hate my body pretty often and VR like the Matrix would be the only way I could experience having another body. But that's probably just me.
gaming,"Hell yes. I second Armagetron. This game is *awesome*.*

^^^*The ^^^computer ^^^players ^^^are ^^^cheating ^^^fucks, ^^^and ^^^it's ^^^great."
gaming,You can cleary see the effort that they put on the script.
gaming,"Ready Player One, Wildcard, Sword Art Online

Ones that I thought of off the top of my head"
gaming,"This better have some slither.io multi-player element or I swear

EDIT: a word"
gaming,"Nope, won't affect you at all.

Unless for some reason everyone decides to boycott Rocket League on PC and stop playing it, that might mean *very* slightly longer queue time."
gaming,"Well this is where things like ""The Fur Friend 9000"" comes in.  It is a block of fake fur that you can rub to simulate rubbing your favorite virtual fluffy friend.

Comes in Grey, Tabby, White, Black and Neon Green Sparkles."

gaming,Badda book : badda boom
gaming,I remember people trying to line you up or if you knew “their spot” they kept going back to you just doing a little tap-tap-tap and usually you’d hear that headshot ding.
gaming,I love my G933's.
gaming,Why do you even want the ps4 for?
gaming,It's a solid game I haven't found any problems with it yet. I play it a little every day.
gaming,What about the suit that lets you have sex
gaming,More words of a person who is clearly not up to date on modern VR.
gaming,I’ll hit that bell.
gaming,"I have the hyper x 2’s, and use them on my ps4 and pc. Don’t have a lot of experience with other brands but for the price they seem hard to beat."
gaming,What if this is life right now what if you’re currently in a game
gaming,"Epic owns the Unreal engine, and last I checked it is not exclusive and they even though it is not fully open-source, they let you view the source and modify it. If you’re biased towards Steam that’s fine but don’t make shit up to justify your biases."
gaming,Isn't that how you guys scout hordes?
gaming,"Rainbow Six Siege.

You got to learn how to headshot. You got to learn how to hold tight angles. You got to learn how to counter traps/set traps. You got to learn vertical gameplay."
gaming,"That's the shortened version of psychology, syke is a slang term. Good try though."
gaming,It was only a dystopia because the world went to hell.
gaming,To this day I don’t use deadeye in red dead cuz I forget how to activate it
gaming,"I love my Corsair hs60 or hs70, idk which, the only difference is the USB adapter that comes with (if you're on Xbox, you won't need it)"
gaming,Name one groundbreaking innovation that has to do with VR.
gaming,Well I don’t have any measuring tools on me that’s why it’s a pain in a ass for me lol but I’m just trying to find the correct fit for the case
gaming,"yes, but all 3 of those basically play the same way."
gaming,Can it be a little of both??? Because I'm game too.
gaming,"People: If you die in the game, you will die in real life!

Me: LEEEEEROOOYYY"
gaming,"My brains trying to comprehend, but it keeps on...shut...ing..d...own.."
gaming,"Or maybe companies can learn from their mistakes? If they did the same thing to BL4 I wouldn't buy it. If they released it on on steam, epic, and what ever else is around at the time I would be okay with it. I can protest both epic and 2k, your reply is half-assed and illogical. Just because someone is protesting something at one point doesn't mean they protest it for life."
gaming,"Worse: When you die in real life, you die in the game."
gaming,That first couple looks like Anthony from smosh and meil
gaming,And now I’m having Howard the Duck flashbacks.
gaming,Oh how the weak fall.
gaming,Not entirely true. Dragon Age II used to be available on Steam and has since been removed.
gaming,"Oh that came off as harsh. There are plenty of cosplay that are just store bought items slightly modified and arranged. 


This one is just a single item bought at a Halloween store, literally any effort beyond this won't be mocked by anyone at a convention or otherwise."
gaming,"I thought that said cheese set. Fancy way to stack the yellow on the left, but what the hell kind of goat did you get the black cheese from??

My brain does the dumb sometimes."
gaming,I used to play this game on my  dreamcast back when I was 10. This seems a lot more fun.
gaming,"Sir, did you try turning the device off and then...back on again?"
gaming,"Looks like a game I’m gonna buy and play for an hour before never touching it again. 

I’m really gonna love that hour"
gaming,"To be precise it would be more of being able to experience living as the other sex because I sometimes hate my own. But I know that most people probably don't have this problem. ;)

What I also think would be difficult to solve is moving around realisticly. At the moment I can make 2-3 steps into a direction and climbing/swiming/flying/jumping around are all impossible."
gaming,"Let's talk about all the good things,

and all the bad things,

and hackin' up your meat"
gaming,"Dawg everything you just said applies to mw1 as well. Classes for heli take downs, PLUS THE SAME WEAPON SWAP GLITCH IS IN MW1 LOL. Sorry dude I don't buy the whole ""I'm a good player so I didn't have those problems."" I spent too much time playing gamebattles to hear some of these fluff explanations. Only thing that I think was worse in mw1 was spawn camping. Once someone got a chopper up it became a very irritating game of we need to get this shit down NOW or gg. But thats fine with your opinions because we all have different ones. :)"
gaming,"Rocket League is too sweaty for me, so I don't really care for this news to be honest. Its not very casual friendly, so I doubt many new players will be flocking to EGS to buy it once it switches. This is kind of a stupid move on Epic's part, but I guess they see something I don't. You know, besides $$$$$"
gaming,No that’s sword base
gaming,"Do you know how many of you have died screaming ""Leroy Jenkins!""? More than zero! Which, as far as I'm concerned, is grounds to exterminate *the species*"
gaming,"Yes, They're competing with each other.

Msi/Evga is competing with each other.

PS4 and Xbox are competing with each other.

Why? Because of money, Each company want's more money, We don't live in a life that each company works together to make something together instead of competing who is better.

That's life, We just have to live it.

Competition to see who is better? Well, It'll never end at this rate, Everything will always stay the same and in the future, We might get even more of the same things made by different companies."
gaming,But Epic and other companies are putting profit over the health of the community and industry. That was my point.
gaming,It might be made in unity but it also has things for moving the character's body. If you look at the sneak peeks you could see what I'm talking about.
gaming,"Honestly I skipped the second one. I’ve started inquisition, got no further than skyhold, then I played origins to the end, and now I’m almost through inquisition. 

I kinda skipped the second game, although inquisition does have a few spoilers for DA2. 

I’ll play it some day, humorous hawke just sounds too good."
gaming,"I can still get a game in modern warfare 2, I literally cannot get a game in any mode in blackops4 within OCE it is fucked how they can still sell blops4"
gaming,Yeah but it's not used to its full potential yet. It has *so much potential.*
gaming,"I loved it, and I think there aren't enough games like it. The way it messed with spatial stuff was great, and it made for some very fun levels. I was really exited for the sequel until it got cancelled. The multiplayer was neat, but pretty much nobody ever played it."
gaming,And all the wildlife. Lots of endangered species live in forests
gaming,Yet another feature Epic Launcher will probably never have.
gaming,Is your internet connection stable? Try running a speed test.
gaming,"I feel betrayed by your username

I mean, if anyone here would take that ball and run with it..."
gaming,It's day 203. I still have not left the campfire.
gaming,Neither low latency networks nor tracking without a mocap suit are new technologies. They've been around for years and years.
gaming,"Nah man, they are. At the end of the year, it'll be removed from Steam's store. If you have the game, it's still there, but if you don't, you'll have to purchase on Epic.

Their future dlc and skins are a different matter."
gaming,"They literally state ""...;thereafter it will continue to be supported on Steam for all existing purchasers.""

So... yes, they have stated they will still be supporting it."
gaming,That's an instant buy for me
gaming,"GUESS WHO'S READY

TO BEGIN WORLD WAR TWO

IT'S GONNA BE SO EXCITING"
gaming,"Not sure about that. Even ignoring all of the VR and accessories' technology, our servers are pretty far behind. That final battle scene would be completely impossible. Even with just a few other people we can't reach what I assume was absolutely no lag"
gaming,That wasn't what I meant. I meant that most 9gang memes suck.
gaming,Animation looks better on the rabbit lol
gaming,"Fuck off with this shit. We've seen enough of BL3 to know it's a worthy successor to the series, including hundreds of hours of gameplay from 200 different streamers. We've seen WAY more than enough for adults to pay the devs for the game in advance without idiots parroting this stupid ""lEt ThEm WoRk FoR YoUr MoNeY!!"" garbage. We've seen the game, we've seen the level of detail and care put into it and even the Twitch extension shows serious care and attention to detail, if someone saw that and decides they want to spend money on it, fuck off with your ""preorder culture is bad"" shit."
gaming,But if it’s red it’s for brutes
gaming,"and here we say Epic becoming the successor to EA. absorbing smaller developers into its own nebulous mass to milk their games’ content dry before leaving their carcass behind, lifeless and broken."
gaming,"You have a 13 year old game for PC so you assume that a modern game made by a different company from a different generation of consoles in a different engine will work the exact same? 

Excuse me?"
gaming,That ding was so damn satisfying.
gaming,Is it more like Chivalry but with bigger maps like battlefield?
gaming,I'm just thinking the amount of porn people are going to watch now with this.
gaming,"Yes, but nothing has been achieved at this level. Compare a Kinect to this. High latency, bad tracking."
gaming,Just go outside and play soccer wtf
gaming,"&gt; Just because someone is protesting something at one point doesn't mean they protest it for life.

That is LITERALLY the point I just made, YOU are the one saying ""I'm protesting BL3 for life because they are having it be timed exclusive at one point""."
gaming,"100% agree. I don't think most people who enjoyed it think it's a literary masterpiece written better than the works of Dostoevsky or Kafka. The reason many enjoy it (me included) is the interesting premise and the ability for it to make us look back on fun stuff we used to do while keeping us entertained. It's light reading, fun and engaging for the intended audience."
gaming,It really does. Adults are really bad at communicating how that works. We need to find better ways to express how quickly things start passing after \~22.
gaming,"As games are transitioning from single release experiences to perpetually updated services I believe this kind of thinking is more important. I agree with you, but once upon a time this wasn't the case. 

It wouldn't be logical to bomb Tiberian Sun because of Westwood selling to EA, but the future of Command and Conquer looked (rightfully) bleak. Later games would suffer due to EA's influence and this is reflected in their reception. But again, Tiberian Sun was never affected and shouldn't have been."
gaming,Are you guys brothers?
gaming,"Gamers these days are so entitled. Let me get this straight, are you pissed off at Epic for undercutting steam in commissions or are you pissed off at the developer for choosing to put their product on a platform that makes them the most money? No one is forcing you to install their launcher, you can always choose not to play those games (not the end of the world).

Do you see Linux or Mac users whining like little kids every time a game comes out as a Windows exclusive?"
gaming,This isn't a bad situation. They said that it would t impact the game in any way and they will still support those who bought it on steam. If you own the game this changes nothing. Do some research before getting all butt hurt over headlines.
gaming,VR is the future boys.
gaming,"You're blind, naive, and need to do some research then."
gaming,"1. The game is still being supported by steam
2. My point about exclusivity still stands because there is no platform change.
3. It is no different than Uplay or Origin"
gaming,"&gt; At the moment I can make 2-3 steps into a direction and climbing/swiming/flying/jumping around are all impossible.

Only if you want it to be 100% realistic. If you saw the crowbar gif, you can still move in all sorts of realistic ways in VR, it just won't feel as real as reality. Regardless, you can just get used to it."
gaming,"Yeah, respawn didnt work back then and it took at least 15 years to make a new soldier which the war would have ended by then. Now ppl talking abt killing without the fear of death by their side"
gaming,Hot take but World at War&gt;Modern Warfare imo
gaming,"""on PC"" is a generous way of phrasing that GFWL retail-only massacre."
gaming,You realize this is the same as real life there's just no actual ball. You might as well kick a real ball around.
gaming,Reverse engineering part of the eyes is a far cry from reverse engineering the entire brain even if they are closely connected.
gaming," - colonialism, a history"
gaming,I feel like they might be tempted to overlook this one.
gaming,"&gt; It'll be simple stuff at first, like google map directions will show a Tron-like line going down the sidewalk to your destination, or something like a ""Smart City App"" where you can point your phone at a restaurant and it will show you their menu and specials, or at the movie theater to get showtimes.

That already exists. Not sure on the TRON line, but I am pretty sure I have seen that. But with Google Lens, you can fotograph something and it tells you what it is, and if it's a restaurant for example, you can access the information that you can also find on Google maps, so ratings, menu, website, etc."
gaming,"Yeah, they all say to uninstall and reinstall. I have a cousin who's good with these sorts of things but he lives thirty minutes away and I'm too young to drive and I figured I would try to do it myself before I made one of my poor parents drive out there so I can play one of the four games I play. You know, since Sims is the only one I use Origin for."
gaming,This savage doesnt have a mouse pad
gaming,How could you betray him like that
gaming,I don't want you to ever watch any sport on TV ever again. Ever.
gaming,"Yep, 30ms on average"
gaming,If people actually use them then it's kind of cool. It's as if arcades finally caught up with the times.
gaming,Tell them to fuck off with the gaystation. If it matters so much to them what you play on. They need to buy you what they want you to have. Ask if they love their own farts too
gaming,"Foot traffic, and to promote the Walmart private brand gaming rigs.

gaming,My ADHD brain is screaming in horror.
gaming,Google VR arcades in your area. I was having the issue with demos as well till I found out VR arcades are more common then I thought. It's a bit pricey at like 30 ish dollars an hour normally. But it sold me on the tech and let me try a bunch of games
gaming,"I mean, this looks cool and all, but I doubt “Ready Player One” is 3-6 months away..."
gaming,"Wow, has it really been that long..."
gaming,I'm pretty excited for the days when we all have an empty room with a little gadgetry in it that basically turns that room in to whatever game we want to immerse ourselves in.
gaming,Make that 99.99%. That trash game does not belong where it can be accessed.
gaming,"Ditto. And that very dangerous slope, lol."
gaming,"If it does happen, I’m all for it. I’d even be a gunter"
gaming,"Give it 20 when we'll get the ""old school"" movie remake"
gaming,"What kind of excuse is that the store just launched? They released a shitty store and the excuse is ""it's new""? An they don't bother to update it when they can afford to buy games and studios? And it's not like they could just see what features other launchers have beforehand and making their own version of them. Steam could use the excuse back then because it was actually new and just discovering what a client like it should even do. Epic simply doesn't care."
gaming,"I think its that his company, Epic Games, has been really anti consumer with their platform recently"
gaming,"OMG, there was never any war with the machines...we didn't blacken the sky...they just made artificial reality more appealing then reality and we all chose to be put into the Matrix just like Cypher...then stayed there willingly...

gaming,"Oh yeah, you should tell that to Ivory Tower. The Crew simply could not get a rear view mirror for exactly this reason."
gaming,How fucking dare you!!
gaming,Can someone explain to me what's the problem with Epic and buying these games? I just hear alot about Epic buying games and companies and how everyone hates them and their decisions but I don't know why. I'd like to know more about this situation now that they have the rights to a game I've put over 1500 hours in.

Such a deep fucking thought"
gaming,"It’s sad af too, rocket league is such a good game with your friends, the micro transactions didn’t really bother me that much, but that move they made is stupid. Fucking bunch of sellouts."

gaming,Aaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh I need this fucking game!!!!!!!!!
gaming,This is not that impressive to be honest..
gaming,They don’t need to provide those things. You’re doing all of this on a computer. A google search won’t kill you. They also wanted to get it off the ground now to capitalize on the popularity of Fortnite
gaming,"They already do this. VR in a purpose built area. You can reach out and touch real world controls, doors open up in game. Such an awesome experience. I would definitely consider spending 10 hours a day at the vr warehouse.

i wouldnt buy it...but its a ""ok"" headset.
You have to make a choice between wireless and wire.
The whole Dolby Digital Quadrologic 5.1/7.1 is just bullshit...and Bullshit is shouldnt cost more.
Whole dts 5.1/7.1 is just simulated by the audio software.

I think the author just assumed that everyone thinks nerds are hackers anyway so it doesn't have to be explained too much"
gaming,"I'm not really for review bombing but I'm less for exclusivity. Epic would have done fine with their developer split bonus. Just advertise as ""purchase on Epic, we support the developers"""
gaming,Yeah. That’s why he’s buying thousands of acres.
gaming,Sounds like you need to become a Chad my boy
gaming,Still less creepy than Sonic.
gaming,In the old days valve actually created games and not just maintain a launcher that provides them income from selling the games of others. While I still haven't used epic's launcher to buy a game that wasn't free. Valve somewhat did this to themselves.
gaming,"I haven't played dark souls but I think if your going for difficulty you should go with dark souls even thouhg the witcher three has the deathmarch mode where enemys deal massive damage.

I know for a fact that TX has some pretty low housing prices overall, even for large houses (excluding some specific neighborhoods like Preston Hollow or Highland Park).  Mine is 4,400 in the middle of the Dallas metroplex, and it was only $440k a year or so ago.  If you go out west of Ft. Worth, you can get houses bigger than mine with several acres for only \~300k.

gaming,"Remember when he buys all the fancy VR stuff he bought when he finally got rich? What about the fact that he just masturbates using vr for like a month in the book??!!?! 

The book was alright imo. I liked the references, I like the concept of finding the Easter eggs inside this VR world everyone lives in and that it’s a contest. It just didn’t wow me."
gaming,Don't do it. Don't give me hope.
gaming,I think his eyes is the part where they fucked up the most
gaming,From what I’ve heard Witcher three has a fairly high difficulty level like dark souls. I’m not tired of the dark souls formula but I have concerns about dark souls two.
gaming,"It won't unless there is some drastic fucking changes to copyright law, or someone with more money than god starts buying/renting IP for it."
gaming,"The people at Epic are being overworked by working 70-100 hours and yes you could say ""They can leave Epic"" but they are contracted and basically are overworked past that contract and breaking it can probably be costly to them as well as possibly getting them blacklisted from the industry which is an industry they really want to work in. Maybe you should look it up as well as NRS, TTG, R*, Bioware, and EA Spouse as well as MANY other studios that brag about crunch periods which is just a way to destroy the employee while lining the CEO's pockets. Hell, TTG's CEO said that Crunch was needed to keep the studio afloat, but they still went under anyway. If your idea of great benefits is not getting weekends off and constantly trying to get these contracts in hopes of being hired by a studio so they can have a (hopefully) more stable paycheck. Then yeah, they have great benefits. The ""bodies"" line comes from this excerpt about the crunch that takes place at Epic's studio.

&gt;“One senior guy would say, ‘Just get more bodies.’ That’s what the contractors were called: bodies. And then when we’re done with them, we can just dispose of them. They can be replaced with fresh people who don’t have the toxic nature of being disgruntled.”

As for your second statement. Yes, Psyonix has been overcharging the hell out of their game like crazy with shitty lootboxes, rocket passes, with a ton of grinding needed to play it, and yes you can ""save"" money by buying in ""bulk"" when it comes to buying Crate keys. They are nickel and diming the hell out of the game and I'm sure once Epic starts making them do 70-100 hour work weeks to add even more shit and yes you can hide behind the shitty argument of ""It's just cosmetic"" but to some people. Having different cars/paint jobs/decals makes the game more enjoyable. To some people, it's not just Cosmetic, but if you play a game where everyone is dressed as a gray box and the devs say ""Pay us $5 for the chance to be a slightly different gray box"" then people  will do that because that's how they will get more enjoyment out of it. Maybe it's because I'm older and I remember the days where you would get different skins/cosmetics from just playing the game. I don't care about competitive advantages each car that you can get from a loot box because I never played competitively in RL but again, it's already being nickel and dimed and now that Psyonix is owned by Epic I won't be surprised if they found a way to try to squeeze more money out of people the same way EA made DICE make BFII and made SO many other companies try to squeeze as much out of people as they possibly could. 

SO, to rebut your analogy, I'm not telling Wrigley to not sell gum because I hate the taste of it. I'm warning people of the shit Wrigley puts their employees through so maybe people would stop supporting shitty companies.

EDIT: I'm sure at the end of my post your opinion won't be changed. You're probably set in your opinions and that's fine. You're entitled to that. That's why you don't have to respond and if you do I won't respond."

gaming,"Really either one would be good. DS2 is only worth it if you get Scholar of the First Sin, but it's also a highly polarizing game. I would tell you that it's worth playing eventually, just for the experience, but there aren't many fans of it like me. I think that if you want something new, Witcher would be fine. I didn't care for it, but this sub is loaded to the brim with people who will tell you it's the second coming of Christ. By no means a bad game, though. 

Alternatively, Dead Space."

Guitar Center is so depressing to walk into nowadays. Half the racks are empty, 1/10th the Used inventory. Who needs instruments when you can be a soundcloud rapper with face tattoos and garageband loops?"

The 80’s references hit you over the head with their subtleties.

Overall, it was actually pretty entertaining. But hell if it wasn’t cringy as all get out. It was like my least favorite part about “gamers” exacerbated in these paper thin characters. Still a decent, easy read."
gaming,"So what good are bad reviews on a game you will soon be unable to buy in the steam store? Also what are epic going to do, tell themselves not to own the game anymore? It's not an exclusive, it is literally an epic games owned game now"

Instead of buying exclusives they could create a better store front/infrastructure or make more in house products."
gaming,Lol I love seeing all these PC have cry about having to install an extra app to buy games 😂😂
gaming,Your wife -&gt; 😐 “That’s nice...”
gaming,"What I see with that formulation, which is a more complete version of the pieces I heard over my teenage years, is that it doesn't deal with the emotional impact. A kid has no idea what a year looks like to himself anyway, since he's totally immersed in the concept of a week (how many relationships end in this time period, how many homework assignments put off, how many life choices are made) the same way you are in the concept of a year.

TBH I think a good formulation is something like ""remember that boy/girl you were thinking about last week, well, when you're an adult, you'll still be thinking about your last man/woman 350 weeks later."" I don't have all the answers though, you have my upboat."
gaming,Psyonix said no one has to move over to Epic Games they can keep playing on Steam
gaming,Ds2 is a great game but it's a bit more open ended compared to the third one same basic combat as you would expect with some slight changes
gaming,It’s SAO all over again!
gaming,It really doesn't have that high of difficulty. It's combat is basically dark souls but you don't have stamina and dodging is essentially effortless. The story is great but my God the combat is a joke.
gaming,"I literally forgot all about that part. The story is fun, but you can tell it was pretty amateur and out of touch writing for a YA novel. And also Wade seems like what the average Reddit user will be in 30 years. Awful hygiene, nice guy vibes, and a know-it-all demeanor."

gaming,Well that's a great load off me mind. Now who are you..other than someone who feeds people to pigs?
gaming,"yeah as a 21 year old, it definitely didn't hit me with the nostalgia the same way it did with the target audience, so I definitely understand why other people enjoyed it so much"

gaming,its better then the sonic adaptation

gaming,"Yes, review abuse and misleading reviews what reviews are for"
gaming,"&gt;	HaptX gloves are around $1,200

gaming,This pleases me greatly
gaming,"I have a seen a trend that everyone's first Call of Duty game they ever play is their favorite (of the older ones). It's true with me, too.

I agree with you that it was a balanced game... but only if you were good enough to get kills with any gun. If you weren't good, only a few class setups would work for you, otherwise you would get destroyed by some of the cheesier additions in the game like danger close or quick scoping or silenced UMPs, or even killstreaks. But if you knew your way around the maps and were good at the game in a technical sense, it was definitely fair."

I also asked for a specific groundbreaking development, and that's a pretty abstract, subjective answer."
gaming,"""But why didn't you use your specialist ability or run on the wall?"""
gaming,So you’re the .001% of people that would be in that scenario though. Not arguing at all just for the record. But my assumption based on general facts is still valid. Idk what the market looks like in Texas and I wont even pretend I do lol. I make a living selling building supplies to rich people in Michigan so I would have to idea. In my area it’s either really old or really new money. It’s really easy to tell who grew up with money and who didn’t. Point still stands though.. I wouldn’t have a job if it wasn’t for people with money so I’m not gunna talk shit lol.
gaming,"[Feelreal](https://feelreal.com/) claims to be able to simulate heat, wind, smell and other things, for $299."
gaming,Yes VR can already be fun to play. Beat Saber for example is already really great. I just feel like that VR we see in Movies or Animes is still some decades away.
gaming,"The unfortunate thing is that even though people complain, they will buy the games anyway and that will incentivize Epic to keep doing what people are comoplaining about."
gaming,"If that's what you're looking for you should try MGQ, the jokes had me rolling on the floor."
gaming,"Oh, good games. I own the xbox one s, but gave it to my little brother and moved to pc since I cant play with console. The only reasons I bought an Xbox over Ps was the controller and Halo. Been a Halo fan for years now, and I cant play with the ps controller, Doesnt feel good In hands when I use it"
gaming,"The book is 500 times better and more epic than the film.

If you like audiobooks, this one is narrated by Will Wheaton. It's great!"
gaming,"Their official communications have shown they're dedicated to ensuring support for as many PC features are possible, they appear to be trying to nail the HELL out of the PC port which plays into the rumors that Microsoft is planning to transition Xbox from a console to a brand (and move into game streaming). They've already discussed all the major features that'd be expected like FOV, ultrawide support, full control over graphical settings, etc. high refresh rate is definitely on their radar."
gaming,thats not the reason why people are pissed you fool
gaming,And the root cause of that was because there was nothing in real life worth being concerned about other than food
gaming,"Epic is owned by tencent. Tencent is owned by china.

Epic had a data breach and lost a royal fuckton of customer info. All they did was tell people to change passwords and get a new debit card.

People now boycott epic because of shit customer relations and because theyre owned by china."
gaming,Oh yeah I agree. I don’t want Capcom to just focus on remasters. One here and there would be great. Like Re3 then maybe a few years later remake CV or some other one
gaming,Is it the same actor?
gaming,"I really hope they make a big deal about how many copies it sells on steam, just to push a dick down Epic's throat a little bit further."
gaming,"Not if you played hardcore. The UMP was bugged where the damage didn't fall off over range, so it was basically a 1 shot kill from any range"
gaming,^I ^have ^a ^119 ^hours. ^:|
gaming,"Ew, so it's still giving money to Epic and still requiring Epic downloaded. Hard pass, I'd rather Epic fail at this and decide to just be their own store instead of making it harder for gamers to use the store they actually want, not because I dislike Epic but because I like Steam and having all my games/achievements/friends/messages/funds in one place is great, splitting all of that in two is just a pain. If I had 10 years of Epic use with all my games and achievements and backups on there it would be the reverse, but I don't, and I'm not going to split my stuff in half at this point."

gaming,*praising of the sun intensifies*
gaming,"I saying thats how they are handling it.  They've already given the details how things are going to work, and the way it's going to work is just like how it worked with Metro.  As in, if you buy the game before the move to Epic you can have it on Steam and it will continue to work.  Even after the game migrates to Epic, your version will still be the Steam version.  After it gets added to the Steam store you will no longer be able to buy it from Steam and as of such, and any copies purchased from that point will only work on Epic."
gaming,You almost have to...
gaming,"I've got a Ryzen 5 2500 (obviously not overclocked) and a 1070ti from Palit (also not overclocked) and my game runs @ 70 FPS at max in SP, same in MP, although I'm getting frame drops if there are lots of ground clutter such as grass near. 
Maybe your CPU is a bottleneck, but honestly I don't really think so because a 1060 and a Ryzen 3 should synergize well. 
Stuttering may also be caused by corrupted game files. Try to reinstall/repair the game if you haven't already done so."
gaming,Steam basically completely dominates the large game platform market. The only other stores that come close are Origin and Battle Net

I will not give Epic a single cent of my money

Paying for exclusivity for a new game is one thing, however buying out a whole studio for the sole purpose of restricting access to their game is completely depraved of moral values and one of the most openly anti-consumer I have ever seen

I will boycott Epic games and any product or developer remotely associated with them and I emplore you all to do the same

Other than that, as long as you're happy with yourself and relatively healthy that's all that really matters. That's just my opinion anyway. I don't know your situation and I don't expect you to share personal info like that with a person you don't know especially on a public thread. I would actually advise against it because that's your business, but you can do whatever you want. I'm just trying to be as fair as I possibly can with limited information."

gaming,"I agree with many of his points but his valley girl voice is just aggravating throughout the video.

Can’t say I’d want to watch more of his content.  One hypocrisy in this video is that he says the snowflakes have no backbone, yet have the motive to lose their job, and the courage to stand up for what they believe.  Regardless if they are right in their conviction, it doesn’t demean their own personal courage.  Also valley girl voice.

Another point, just because all races/genders typically have it better in the West, doesn’t mean that all genders/races have it equally in the West.  One can say hurr durr durr I know I’m a white man, but that still doesn’t change one’s ability to empathize. Also valley girl voice.

One last thing, I have also worked in a management position for a multi billion dollar company.  Higher ups and lower downs, everyone had sex on the brain.  My point is that his is an anecdotal experience, as is mine.  Personal experiences do not reflect the majority, and I’m not sure why he brought it up.

He had some good points otherwise.  But like I literally just can’t even ya know?

gaming,"I'm gotta get on in here to say I'm actually happy for every game publisher dropping steam for any other platform. While i don't like EPIC it's not even close to how much i hate steam. And i hope this loss of titles somehow motivates them to bring their burning heap of a platform in order.

So many bad experiences; the launcher refusing to start 99 out of 100 times and forcing me to completely restart the PC, shit tier download speeds, beyond worthless customer support, beyond worthless offline mode.

In case of GTAV which i bought on sale, downloaded it completely while the whole time steam was allocating space. The download was complete and it was still allocating space. Cancel that, and your whole download disappears. Left it running for 2 whole days and it was still allocating space. Thought I'd refund it and try anew, but for whatever reason i had 16 hours logged on it. Try to contact the support, find out just how worthless it actually is, finally get through to a person only to hear ""yeah, nah, is your fault""

I'll sooner download the 50th other launcher or pirate a game than buy anything on steam again. Only reason i have it is because of other games on it that i could only get on there and can't even start without starting up steam."

gaming,"I have the entire set of Cards Against Humanity and cant get anyone to sit down and play, but this looks way more complicated and you have a whole cluster of friends...what’s this game about?"
gaming,More like Halo is catching a break. It'll be a day 1 buy for many PC gamers who haven't paid since Halo 2. This is something that M$ should have done a long time ago. It'll be nice to play it on good hardware.
gaming,"Some of us wont be buying anything from Epic out of principle. There's plenty of great games on other platforms or like the gentlemen below stated if we really want to play something like Borderlands 3, we'll just buy it on console."

gaming,"""Presence"" is not an innovation. Name one new technology involved.

You only recently discovered VR and think it's the most amazing thing in the world, didn't you?

This has been a thing for 2-3 decades now, recently quality jumped and people started selling them on a larger scale, but *nothing about this is new*.

And I've used several VR headsets in the last few years. Like I said, it's a nice effect. Nothing about it is groundbreaking."
gaming,"Game news sites are reporting both. Depends on which news sites you check. Some say it is being removed, others say it's not."
gaming,"I would get pro then, the graphics are worth it!"

gaming,Just watching this is giving me a headache but boy do I want to play this now
gaming,"I can understand that, as well. The game is only really made for a certain type of person, and I'm luckily one of those people. But I can definitely see the complaints of it being too slow and too realistic, I just enjoyed those mechanics. Usually, I hate survival games and over-realistic games, but RDR2 was just unique to me."
gaming,Yet all their sales figures (units sold) are going down year over year... its unsustainable and as soon as the general populace fully understands what they are doing then they will be in big trouble.
gaming,"Plenty of Mario games are pretty much the same thing again but I wouldn't say that they all are. It makes sense to prioritize your most popular property. The one that will always sell well, but I do wish that the smaller properties would get some attention.

Zelda games are formulaic, yes, but Breath of The Wild did try to change the formula, whether or not you think that's good is up to you but you shouldn't deny that it's something different.

Pokémon has also been very formulaic, even more so than Zelda, but with Black &amp; White, a bigger emphasis was placed on story and with Sun &amp; Moon, gym leaders were removed entirely and replaced with totem Pokémon. Not exactly big changes but it's something. I didn't really like Sun &amp; Moon but I do like the attempt to do something different for once.

Dude, you're comparing a freaking PS3 game to a DS game. That's like if I said that an NES game looks worse than a PS1 game.

Ridiculously bad is not how I would describe the graphics. The Wii was underpowered when it came out but that doesn't make the games ugly by default. The Wii U was also underpowered but it had HD at least. Even though Nintendo do a bunch of stupid things, at least their games consistently run well unlike many other games that prioritize graphics.

Funny you mention FPS. FPS games actually play a lot better with the Wii remote but that never caught on because of how stubborn ""hardcore"" gamers were, insisting that traditional controllers are better for the genre even though they are not.

What does Nintendo have to offer? Having plenty of exclusive games is enough. Exclusives are why you would even spend any money on a console to begin with. What do you want them to offer?

It's fine to dislike Nintendo but your arguments are so childish and so weak."
gaming,"30fps and those graphics will look... not good. 5 bucks, not more"
gaming,"I saw this game and said fuck it I need a new game il take a gamble on it. Very glad I did, its a lot of fun. The only issue right now is they are having some problems with earning progress. I played about 5 games and have not earned any xp or gold yet. Regardless its still a lot of fun"

gaming,"In GTA V, I take a cab everywhere so my cars don't get damaged and I don't have to worry about cops. Plus I can enjoy the scenery and watch the funny shit that goes down."
gaming,but also depends on the amount of content
gaming,"&gt;My two biggest gripes are that Spielberg didn't include any Star Wars references for the dumbest reason possible. It felt like a conflict of interest to me. The other is the book ending, in regards to how the main characters came together, was exponentially better.

The revolution subplot and making Sorento cartoonishly evil (and dumb) were pretty bad... Also the idea that after a decade or so of working on the most important puzzle in the world, nobody tried to go backwards in the stupid race. Do they even know gamers? Hahaha I fully agree in that Spielberg managed to succeed in the things I thought were impossible to do well (The Shining challenge was the perfect interpretation of the Movie-Game thing)  but then he went and did all that.  


Also,  [Mark Rylance](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0753314/?ref_=tt_cl_t7)  was a better Halliday than my mind could ever come up with."
gaming,And why his arms are missing?

gaming,"that's not even remotely true lol. Yes we're getting better with VR headsets but haptic technology is nearly nonexistent outside of basic touch responses. At this point, we are nowhere close to escaping a small rectangular play area, and can't interact with static physical objects (walls, cover for FPSs etc) in a realistic way. You're describing technology that plugs into your brainstem and whisks you away to some digital universe, we don't have that and aren't clos"
gaming,"&gt;pretty similar to say... Sword Art Online

That's a pretty good comparison. I still love both as eye-rolly as a lot of both of them are."
gaming,"I think I see it, it's that part where the devs sold out, and wanted money more than they wanted to make a great game."
gaming,Its also 100 dollars more but i would agree ... now i just need to replace my crappy 720p tv with a 4k one

gaming,"The crew could be special, because of the nature of the online game, though I dont know anything about its development to back that up."
gaming,Me too. Now i cringe when i hear they sing.
gaming,Its a transaction for a small amount of money for a small amount of content. (Even if its just cosmetic). It is by very definition a micro transaction. People are reading into it too much. Simply devs trying to pass things off as something else simply because it doesn’t make a competitive difference. It is still a mtx.

You should also turn off every other program that you don't need for gaming while you play and also scan for viruses.
Check windows update if it is not stuck on downloading updates.
Run a virus scan
And lastly, reinstalling windows could always help in case of a PC not performing the way it should.
P.S Ram could also be an issue - if it is not enough or too slow for the game you are playing."

gaming,"From what I understand the whole rest of the game is just normal fantasy stuff and the real life aspect of it doesn't pay off at all, which seems disappointing."
gaming,"Dan Houser said that they won't make one, because of the lack of control they would have over the movie and such. 

Quotes from the interview:

&amp;#x200B;

""The second you go near Hollywood, people seem willing, or have been forced, to lose a lot of that control. That sort of amorphous 'that won't test well' attitude is exactly how we don't work. We've always tried to think of stuff that's innovative and new, and to go into a world where that's not encouraged would be horrible."" 

&amp;#x200B;

""We've got this big open-world experience that's 100 hours long, and that gives players control over what they do, what they see, and how they see it. A world where you can do everything from rob a bank to take a yoga lesson to watch TV, all in your own time. How do you condense that into a two-hour or 12-hour experience where you take away the main things: player agency and freedom?"""

gaming,"&gt; Also, Mark Rylance was a better Halliday than my mind could ever come up with.

He's an oscar winner after all but I was still impressed, regardless. I also liked the Asperger's type of portrayal they went with.

&gt; Also the idea that after a decade or so of working on the most important puzzle in the world, nobody tried to go backwards in the stupid race. Do they even know gamers? 

This was a pretty big gripe for a lot of people. I can absolutely guarantee someone would've tried driving backwards on the very first day. The Oasis was supposedly the most played game on the planet after all. You bet your ass one of the billions of players would've attempted it.

However, I took my grandmother to the movie and she was surprised by that scene. For people that don't play a lot of games shit like that doesn't even cross their mind. 

If they were making a movie based on mass appeal I can understand how the writers came to that conclusion. It's still waaaay too easy of a challenge compared to the others, no matter how you look at it."

But in the last 1-2 years, they've done a 180 and really listened to feedback, they have Massive halo 3 tournaments going on right now with old pros coming back to compete, they fixed mcc and bought it to pc and w're looking at Xbox cross platform (uncofirme but pretty likely) + infinite has been confirmed on PC. 

They've changed the art style, they confirmed reach like customisation for infinite and are taking lots of inspiration from halo 1. Not mention there are rumours that infinite will be the most expensive game ever made, I'm talking $500+ million on Production ONLY so not even including marketing. The attitude for halo in this subreddit has been very positive lately, things are looking very good for halo right now and it's future."
gaming,so do we need a big break? something to really change up the gameplay?

gaming,Keep it in the fridge and if sticks a lot easier.
gaming,"I'd argue that in this case it's totally justified.  People thinking about buying Rocket League deserve to know that Steam support will almost certainly be ending, and probably soon.  Linux gamers, in particular, have 100% right to be pissed off.  When RL leaves Steam and moves to Epic, that means no more official Linux builds.

Not to mention that it'll be losing Workshop mods as well.  And all the other features of Steam which EGS lacks.

This isn't a case of ""we disagree with the company's policies or politics, so we're punishing their products.""  This is a clear and inarguable situation where the product is about to become objectively worse, taking away compatibility and features previously available. If that isn't justification for reviewers to complain, what the hell is?"

gaming,"Its not about them being a paid shill, its about them being a mindless fan boy. You can shill without being paid because you're so into them."
gaming,"&gt;I also liked the Asperger's type of portrayal they went with.

Agreed. It fit the character so much better than how I think he was written.

&gt;If they were making a movie based on mass appeal

That's about the truth of it. It was probably the trade-off to get it made at all."
gaming,"Damn, they got almost every buzzword in to that. That is an impressive work of bullshit."
gaming,"Epic bought the company out. No longer being sold through steam.

EDIT:  Really? Downvotes for passing along the context i was aware of at the time?"
gaming,"None of which has happened yet, so it shouldn't be reviewed as such. This sort of review bombing is ridiculous and directly contributes to limits being placed on community reviews which is something the same sort of people piss and whine about."
gaming,My disk is at 100% always but is something in idk what/s. But is a very low usage like 1.8 mb
gaming,"If the Epic store had most of the features of steam and used the timed exclusives to get us to try them, I doubt we would be having this debate"

Halo is and has been extremely active, with 5 being the most popular Halo title in nearly a decade. It’s a good time for Halo, but that’s not because the series was in dire straits and MS pumped more money into it, it was already doing well. Also the $500 million rumored budget would include the cost of engine development so that would need to be taken into account as well"

They used to at least try and put out new seasonal or fun modes, but it's just all 'quality of life' updates, and I use that term loosely. ""Fixed the text in a back menu you never noticed for PS4. 5gb update on Xbox"""

gaming,"Really the best way is to get an SSD drive, if you have the money. It's about $120 for a 500gb drive and it would be a world of difference in loading speeds too"
gaming,The enderdragon when I have 1.5 hearts left
gaming,I will go to Gamestop and buy a copy of Fortnite right now!
gaming,"I’m impressed that they had time to make about 59 different types of game in 59 different engines. No wait, not impressed. Pissed off! That’s the phrase I was looking for!

Mobile gaming is a cancer and this is one of the most obnoxious yet."
gaming,I'll take my chances
gaming,At least rabbit is wearing his seat belt. Animators on sonic just didn't care.
gaming,I'm so ready to play this!
gaming,It's fine. I wanted to avoid making anything personal and wanted to present things how I saw them. I would rather our conversation end this way rather than constantly arguing when neither of us is going to change our POV.
gaming,"Not sure does it fit, but after a 6 month pause I opened up Project CARS 2 and joined probably the dumbest lobby ever.

It was a LMP900 category at Le Mans, during winter, so the tyres and brakes were always cold no matter what, literally undriveable.

I managed to qualify on pole in the Toyota GT-One since no one else even managed to put in a lap.

And just dominated the race even tho I was stopping more than necessary just for new warmedup tyres.

But halfway through the last lap I realize I got less fuel than needed to finish, so I just drove the rest half speed in hope I can make it.

Last corner I stop dead, wrote GG no fuel in the chat, and just as I was about to quit, this backmarker starts blinking me from afar and before I can write he comes and pushes me to victory."
gaming,"""Take her away, Ern"" ""Yee take her away Ernie"""
gaming,Warm RGB toast is my favorite thing for breakfast
gaming,"Oh for sure, h5 multiplayer was enjoyable, they even had multiple halo world championships with hundreds of thousands of viewers, but it was never h3 level. H3 was on another scale, it was on of entertainments biggest launch and success story. What I meant was infinite could come no where close to h3 (which it still might not) without the foundation laid out for it now. Every halo has been extremely profitable since it's a juggernaut brand, but they need to do better imo or what I mean is fully realise Halo's potential, because h5 and h4 definitely aren't it's full potential."
gaming,"Step 1: casually walking up to High Hrothgar at lvl. 5. 

Step 2: sees goddamn frost troll. 

Step 3: *insert i am speed meme*

Step 4: Enters High Hrothgar w/ goddamn frost troll on my heel.

Step 5: Greybeards fus-ro-dah him to infinity and beyond.

Step 6: profit!!"
gaming,"&gt; There was a big Mary Sue element to the book, but the trip down memory lane from reading it was nice. At a few points I was like ""THIS IS SO AWESOME"" then I realized most people who didn't grow up in the 80s would really have no clue what the fuck is so neat about this stuff and aren't enjoying the book the same way I am.

Yes, fully. A lot of people are really down on the book, but it tends to be younger people who didn't get the nostalgia burst from it that oldies you like you and me did. Among people our age, everyone I have talked to loved it (even though, yes, there is some really bad writing in parts)."
gaming,Start the krack of dawn with some toast nice.
gaming,"I need to chill on buying games right now, thank you"
gaming,"Borderlands 3 isn't even out yet.  I'm not sure what the meme is even trying to communicate.  That Epic is killing franchises?  Well there's no proof of that here.  That Epic is killing your vibe about each of these games?  Well that's just an individual perspective at best.  Are we saying that these games are going to suck going forward, and perhaps Borderlands 3 will be DOA?  Well, that's a bit of a leap considering all of these are successful franchises that are now associated with a very successful developer/publisher.  I'm not an Epic fanboy in the slightest, but this is a shit meme."
gaming,"It baffles me that you somehow think that they won't update anything about the game to modern standards. 60FPS+ is a STANDARD now, sort of the point of actually even adding it to MCC."
gaming,Wins bread like nothing else!
gaming,Is Ready Player One worth a watch? Heard mixed reviews from friends and social groups and honestly I haven't seen it yet.
gaming,I just recently played BO3 at a friend's house. Imagine my surprise when I can't knife fuckers anymore and Mellee is basically a halo elbow.
gaming,"Sounds like a wall clip (a known speed run strat), but without further descriptions or screenshots, it’s hard to tell."
gaming,This will be Oculus VR.
gaming,That game looks so damn complex! I love it!
gaming,"But, is it a MMO ?"
gaming,Just chill in the town of beginnings and let everyone else do the work lmao
gaming,"Yea, Boneworks is gonna be very interesting. But to get the real VR experience, we are gonna have to wait for the gloves and... Socks? Boots? Idk"
gaming,"“Real-Time Stabber”

“Real-Time Slasher”

Take your pick"
gaming,Mass Effect 2 nuff said😎
gaming,It was even more fun in the initial version of MW2. If you held a supply drop marker for some reason you ran much faster than your normal run speed. You couldn't use your gun but your knife worked just fine.
gaming,"I guess i have the advantage that my younger brother is 8 years younger than me so I have a good sense of the ""half generation"" after me's experience growing up. 

I do tend to forget there is an 8-year difference sometimes though. When my younger brother introduced us to his girlfriend and I learned she was 19, my first thought was that she was just a kid, and it was kinda creepy, before I remembered he was 22, not 30."
gaming,"What we want is SAO.  If i actually have to run around, whats the point of vr?  Ill just do it myself."
gaming,"it is but it was a weird way of doing it
and i cant get screenshots because it was on nes classic"
gaming,Just saying every new release on PC doesn't have unlocked frames and Halo back in the day was no different. Am I crazy? You all are acting like I'm crazy..
gaming,Literally can't play without that mod
gaming,"Well this is incredibly pessimistic. True, it's physically exhausting, but some do get that kick out of the immersion. True, you could script increasingly complicated actions to increasingly mundane inputs until an entire game is simply a cutscene you tab through.  


There's nothing that mandates people using their true identies/appearances with this tech. If anything, people might feel more liberated by endlessly customizing and enhancing their digital avatars, just as they do in low-tech games right now.....well now THAT sure has some negative implications for people's psyches."
gaming,[SOLVED] TACTICS ARENA ONLINE
gaming,"Would it be worth to buy a 120 gb one? I only have money for that ( considering that I only use disk space for those games and mostly overwatch, lol and apex)"
gaming,DA2 was such a weak effort compared to the rest of the series. Still had fun with it though.
gaming,"No ones saying Halo 3 level, just that the franchise was already in the best state it’s been since then, even before the MCC PC announcement"
gaming,1 v 1 me on shipment snipers only you fucking n00b
gaming,"If you don't mind how ""Look! Remember all these references you guys???"" It is, then it's a fun watch/read."
gaming,Usually just connects after a minute 👍
gaming,"This game was good, but i wish it lived up to the first one a bit better. It got really repetitive and the lack of studio ghibli cutscenes is kinda sad."
gaming,Yeah 120gb should do as well
gaming,"Well let's hope not everyone is like you, not to mention most review bombing don't take the time to write out a bunch of paragraphs of ""bullshit"" either way steam has implemented a way for the consumer to decide wether to take I to account to the review bombing into the score. Can see the borderlands review bombing g to see an example of the system at work."
gaming,"I wonder how they are doing the body tracking in that first one. A coworker has looked at a few different options, some are reasonable but jenky / very roll your own. Some very much are not but basically turnkey."
gaming,"1080p? okay, thats easy. Go for something like a ryzen 5 2600,an sapphire rx580 nitroand an 8gb Ram dual kit. Check out PCpartpicker.com, there you can customize your own setup. When buildingbitbyou can just look up a tutorial on YouTube. Everything that is not from the verge should do the trick."
gaming,live streaming at the moment dont forget to check it out!!
gaming,Watch his kids sell all the land to a housing development when he dies
gaming,This is the kinda stuff I see in my feverdreams
gaming,"Why was the dude trying to block the soccer ball with his hand? He didn’t have a tracker on there?

Also, the one with the soccer field isn’t what VR actually looks like. The camera just puts the people in the VR environment with a green screen. But the two people in VR just see a headset floating instead of a person."
gaming,Props to you! now go get some fresh air...
gaming,Yeah ur right I got it confused. Cod4's knife reach was just deceptively sneaky. Sometimes you wouldn't lunge to hit someone and other times its like your body was shot out of a cannon to reach someone.
gaming,I'll be 50 probably (38 atm) but bring it!!! Imma gamer until death.
gaming,I can’t focus on another sub
gaming,"There next plan is to drop 100 9 year olds there and make them fight each other to the death for a prize of 400,000 dollars"
gaming,"Holy fuck - an Almost Heroes reference, in the wild. This is unheard of."
gaming,"If you read the book, it is slightly disappointing, in that they didn't' follow it of course. Keep in mind though, that the author had decent control over where they went and what they could afford, and was on course the whole time, last I read.   
So yea, there's some changes, but they did what the could, and the author at least did a ""good enough"" shrug as it was being produced."
gaming,Being bankrupt is losing all your money so... No shit?
gaming,Steam doesn't work that way. They have been sidelining themselves on this debate for quite a while. Not to mentionthey didn't overlook the borderlands review bombs I'm sure they won't overlook this one. You can see those review bombs how the system works.
gaming,Wow let’s just hope that the new halo game will be a REACH in the the right direction
gaming,"Probably the inclusion of a battle pass to begin with. That, and being the billionth battle royale game of the last two years is really grating on normal peoples' patience. They want a fresh experience."
gaming,According to who now?  I get it. I DO.  I loves my f's but I'm not gonna argue a moot point.  I'm not counting on it till it's in writing is all.
gaming,No probably about it.  We are still VERY far off.
gaming,"If you want that push-and-pull dichotomy between the real world and fantasy then play the first Ni no Kuni. No no Kuni is a literal translation of *''A Second World''*. So of course there is the first world (our reality) and the second world. 

  
The second Ni No Kuni has little to do with the original idea for the series other than the fact it's set in the Second World."
gaming,I've got about 20 hours into it and I haven't had any glitches like this. I would recommend it but like another commenter said there are some technical problems my frames drop when it rains too and that can be frustrating. I'd check out some game play. And a lot of people are calling the story generic. It really doesn't seem to be. First game in awhile that I enjoyed getting to know the characters.
gaming,So much want to activate spectator mode!
gaming,Probably take some DMT and hunt elk too
gaming,Thank you man ❤️. You are the best.
gaming,vr is so close. so many headsets still very uncomfortable and low resolution relative to the distance from the eye it's distracting. also motion sickness was a thing at a VR world I attended.
gaming,"Am I the only one a little bugged that Reach is being released before Halo CE? I understand it's the first story-wise, but if they had to release them episodically I would have preferred release order, in-line with how the games progressively got better.

Not too bugged though, Halo is a day one purchase."
gaming,Wow the new I AM BREAD update is fancy
gaming,I dont know I'm just assuming if they're remaking a 15 year old game they may add a basic addition that's been a standard for basically any game for the last decade.
gaming,You can't get the bread tho. Since you already got it.
gaming,"Look up onwards esports it's a vr military sim, kinda like a mix between rainbow six and arma.  It's pretty cool, but is now a decent sized esports following for it."
gaming,"dmc 3 special edition, that game is just a masterpiece"
gaming,“Anyone who owns” doesn’t mean new purchases will be allowed.
gaming,"&gt;in your lifetime

But like what if I die tomorrow"
gaming,"James Marsden needs a better agent. Dude is a great actor, he can do better"
gaming,I like that he has the pc version of Halo: Combat Evolved on his desk. It's cool to see how far the series has come since it was released.
gaming,aw thank ye :)
gaming,Hope its dark souls
gaming,Well... That's enough internet for one day.
gaming,what about the buying of acres of forest?
gaming,I despise those cock wombles at Epic.
gaming,"There’s an amazing song about DA2 and DAI: 

[Age of the dragon](https://youtu.be/lChS4ZJtTXQ) for DA2 
And [all as one](https://youtu.be/3MVqdYcbDp8) for Inquisition. 

I love those two songs."
gaming,"Oh, So you're approaching me?"
gaming,They should really create a separate sub for this
gaming,Is that a mullet?
gaming,10/10 would play. Where do we get it!?
gaming,"don’t care, no nerd rage here"
gaming,"remember kids, dont do drugs."
gaming,"Halo doesn't need a damn thing other than the name ""Halo"" to perform. 

It all help generate a buzz for sure, but I wouldn't say anything near ""Needing"" momentum. Just the title ""Halo"" gets panties wet and preorders flowing."
gaming,"Yeah I loved Halo 4's story. The multiplayer was ok.
Halo 5's campaign wasn't that good tho like you said verticality and alternate paths were cool. The multiplayer on the other hand was some of the best I've ever played."
gaming,"Only if you care about playtime, something not all people do.

I rather pay $60 for a five hour long game I have a great time with than $60 for a 60 hour long game I find mediocre.

And I've yet to find a long game which I didn't think had way to much padding."
gaming,"You can do that now with Vam (Virt-a-mate)

just be aware there are no features for the basement dweller, you might want to try vrchat for that lol."
gaming,"Steam sales, in general are hit and miss and it solely depends on the publisher. You’re already getting a steal at $20 as is"
gaming,It's a little creepy how I posted 14hrs on my FB about how I hope Oasis happens in my lifetime.
gaming,"
&gt; This really bothers the brain as it thinks it should adjust focus when convergence changes, and it cannot. This is why some people get headaches or nausea when using VR. 

One of the first things you learn in binocular vision courses is:

-Change in convergence CAUSES change in accommodation

(separately)

-Change in accommodation CAUSES change in convergence

They are intricately linked in the brain, and will occur automatically with or without VR."
gaming,Oh sweet lord fishbowl view- *vomit*
gaming,Agreed. Making a rocket league racing stand alone or expansion is a no brainer and will print money.
gaming,fuck im so excited for Boneworks! (the game at the end) it looks like what I wish half life 3 was.
gaming,"The first game jumped back and forth between our world and the other world very often, so perhaps they didn't feel like retreading what they already covered. Besides, despite the isekai president, the game's main character is actually a boy-king native to the fantasy world, and the story is about the creation of his own kingdom."
gaming,So what you're saying is that I'll be buying it twice.
gaming,"Actually, these properties are one of the worst investments on the board due to high development costs and the fact that Park Place is one of the least landed on spots on the board. You are more likely to land on Luxury Tax. 

Also, landing on Go To Jail sends you to jail, eliminating one spot on the prime area leading up to those properties (note that the most common dice roll is 7 and Park Place is seven steps from Go To Jail). Because of the same mechanic the orange and red properties are one of the best investments. Illinois Avenue is one of the most *highly* landed on spots.

On top of that, if you have to trade to acquire the whole set, then you will likely pay a premium because players know those are the most expensive properties with the highest rents, so even if a ""fair"" trade values Boardwalk at $700, the player might ask for $800 or even $900 worth of property for it."
gaming,Well the rift s doesn't really add anything.  I have a rift and I wouldn't consider upgrading because it's only a minor improvement for $400.  At least the index improves in pretty much every category
gaming,If only I could put it on my resume.
gaming,So all I need is a soccer field in my living room.
gaming,It's been a dystopia since the fall of the Roman empire!
gaming,Does anybody even plays rocket league anymore
gaming,"Thanks.  I wasn't offended actually, more confused.  But your're right I went off the rails there."
gaming,I haven't played that yet but I've heard very good things.
gaming,I just picked up FFX Remaster for Switch and the damn game is 17 years old. I’m outta here
gaming,You're right... I'll just get Fallout then. If I spot anything good during the sale I'll just drop a little more cash lol
gaming,"We get it, Franke Muniz."
gaming,"Difference?

HOP was great, that thing below looks like garbage. (Save for Jim Carrey’s Eggman. That’s the only good thing.)"
gaming,"Dude, for real. That lemon tree was haunted."
gaming,Don't give Netflix any idea.
gaming,"Less want to invest in making software for these headsets because the install base isn't there compared to Console, PC, or mobile spaces.  And people don't want to buy the hardware because the software isn't there.

Until that cycle breaks by either making the price of the hardware a huge loss leader or someone releases the Halo, the Mario, or the Wii Sports of it (as in, the thing people need to buy the hardware because they NEED this software), even a drop to those numbers isn't going to move the needle enough.  Sure, it'll help sell some units.  But not the amount which will really kick things into high gear."
gaming,"Psyonix and Epic have always had a very close relationship.  This move is actually in Psyonix's favor: more funding available for their pro-level tournaments and greater access to the inner workings of the Unreal Engine than they previously had.  They've already assured that they won't be forcing existing PC players to re-purchase the game on the Epic Store, and they'll continue offering and supporting console versions."
gaming,Like 97% sure its transistor
gaming,"It will NOT happen in our lifetime that gamingconsoles for the ""average"" consumer (like a current ps4pro user) will be able to purchase something that will deliver the kind of world the oasis was.  


It needs like multiple gigantic jumps in tech to do that.  
Like from PacMan to Skyrim is 1 jump, we would need like 2-3 to reach the Oasis for consumers in technical revolution."
gaming,He is the only thing I like about the movie.
gaming,And capitalism. Surprisingly this game was banned in the USSR because apparently people actually liked the game there.
gaming,A tim sweeney post where he isnt a fucknig colossal douchebag. Amazing.
gaming,"We get it, steam finally has a rival, but epic as a platform straight up sucks"
gaming,I have a need to play this on my Nokia smartphone...
gaming,It will help you budget but expect by the time you saved up new stuff will be out at around the same price
gaming,Thank God. Get me outta this sucky real world asap!
gaming,Who takes my money sir?
gaming,"I mean, you're basing your statement off a 13 year old game, versus the words of the devs who are saying they're going to try to achieve *at least* 144hz support, and possibly completely unlocked framerates.

The only games that *might* have issues with this is CE and 2."
gaming,Thanks guys! I'll definitely check these out. I'm just really confused when looking at specs for each part. I don't wanna buy too low or too high for the parts that I need to get the result that I wanted.
gaming,"Fair point, I’m just disappointed to see so many games move to a pretty anti-consumer market place."
gaming,That doesn't make any sense
gaming,Perfect recipe for yikes
gaming,Would rather have a nervegear

Actually, why don't you tell me which publisher is losing money year over year? That seems easier at this point."
gaming,"We are nowhere even remotely close to the level of read/write on a human brain for this to be possible. For instance to read a sentence out of somebody's head; and i mean one of a cloud of options you've finely tuned the system to pick up. requires an MRI and several hours of HPC time to pull off. Not exactly something you can carry around in your pocket.

edit: as far as sending information back in, it's primarily in the form of interference. we can basically cause temporary shorts that manipulate decision making. But we can't make an image appear in your mind."
gaming,Just joined this subreddit and the first post I see is self promo... which isn't even related to gaming.

gaming,Vita was my favorite console portable or otherwise. I love mine.
gaming,"You can get VR right now, its pretty dope."
gaming,That would burn your toast :(
gaming,"On one hand, Fallout New Vegas GOTY is a game so delightfully excellent that it's well worth the 19.99 dollar price tag.

On the other hand, I've seen it go on sale for around 7 dollars.

I'd suppose it's a matter of whether or not 12-ish dollars is worth delaying you getting into a long-lasting game. If you have a backlog, consider waiting."
gaming,"&gt; Idk what about your body you hate, but if it's something you're really unhappy with then maybe you should consider looking for ways of fixing that(if possible) to increase your happiness.

Oh I agree. Doing sports and eating healthy is always a good idea. For me at the moment it's more that I sometimes hate my sex but this isn't something that can be changed. I just find happiness in other ways. :) Concentrating on living a healthy life, always meeting new exciting people and also like visiting new countries which is always pretty fun. VR would just help with the last thing I can't really do in real life. :)"
gaming,It might get outworked
gaming,Should be the other way around
gaming,At least for Epic the issue people have is that they arent trying to make a better product for end consumers. No one is upset that Epic has its own store. No one would be upset if BL3 went to Epic because it had better features. From the publics perspective they are being forced into a new monopoly instead of choosing between competitors.

gaming,"Yes, I've lowered the settings to lowest, but still got the same performance. My GPU is normally at 40 some percent utilization, while my CPU is at 100. My CPU I believe is bottlenecking my GPU."
gaming,Yeah this doesn't suddenly unfuck the people that work 70+ hour work weeks so Fornite can get consistent updates.
gaming,We used to wear an onion on our belt; which was the style at the time.
gaming,I disagree I think if you have managed your other properties correctly and have enough income from smaller properties like the orange and red then you can really stomp down your opponents with proper management of Boardwalk and Park place. But it might just be a matter of play style.
gaming,MacBooks start at $1300 and 90% of people I know with them (which is a lot) use them as glorified web browsing and note-taking machines. That's not to mention whatever iPhones are out every year that people buy. I'm not sure what you qualify as mass adaptation but assuming the price will go down as the technology develops - look at computer prices from 20 years ago - $1200 is nothing. People spend as much on gaming computers.
gaming,"Here is a list of every game that uses Unreal Engine. Have fun.

gaming,"CPU: Intel if you can afford it and/or heat generation is a concern. Otherwise AMD is ""more bang for buck"" but runs hot and has a higher WATT consumption per KWH.

Graphics: This used to be important, but these days the differences aren't that big. 1080p is most graphics cards since 2011. However, FPS is determined heavily by the game, so even with the best graphics card you can buy today, in a year or two it's down from ultra graphics to High if you want to keep the frame rate"
gaming,"Wow, I'm actually surprised seeing a few yes's. The book is cringy, horribly written nerd fanfic. It's the 90s geek Twilight. The movie is one of the few instances I can think of that did it better than the book on the simple basis of being bareable."

EDIT:  I just looked it up, and Epic Game Store offers refunds for 14 days or 2 hours of gameplay, whichever comes first."

gaming,"I particularly remember the game ""Aventure"" that the book references many times; it was one of the first real fantasy-themed video games ever made; I owned it and LOVED it and played it all the time; I had heard about the secret room and everything but since there was no internet to go track down information I didn't know how to get to it.

&amp;#x200B;

After reading the book I went and immediately recommended it to my brother; he hasn't read it yet but I know he would fucking love it.  Maybe the book was only meant for us who grew up in the 80s at the very beginning of computer and video games, but that's good enough for me."
gaming,I mean yknow except the movie part. I mean the movie looks fine except the sonic cgi looks disgusting

gaming," As a connoisseur of real goat action, all I can say is...

Still worth it."
gaming,well there are other websites that sell steam keys. One of them is G2A. I know it doesn't have the best reputation but from what I heard from my friends and my own experience it hasn't fucked anyone up. Yet. I think New Vegas cost like 6 euros in there.
gaming,"They said they are removing it from steam in late 2019, You will still keep the game but you can't buy it on steam after that. No one knows if you'll even still be able to get dlc on steam or if it just won't be supported"

gaming,"Why would I not write a negative review when a company does something I don’t support that, in my opinion, will make the game worse? That’s exactly the point of reviews. Not every review is a comprehensive overview of every aspect of the game."
gaming,"I guess they are looking at this like consoles. Having exclusives will probably incentivize people into using your thing over the competition. I can see how this would be annoying since PC gamers didn't exactly have to put up with exclusives beforehand. My problem is that instead of making new games themselves or commisioning another studio to do it, they make games that were not planned to be exclusives be exclusives."
gaming,"My first fight with Markoth from Hollow Knight. I was down to 1 hp, and there aren’t any health bars in Hollow Knight so I didn’t know how damaged Markoth was.

gaming,Those are all coming. Soon. You can see the Epic store dev. roadmap for yourself. It's updated regularly with stable changes and incoming updates.
gaming,those things were so annoying
gaming,Just go to epic store what problem?
gaming,"I completely understand that.  While I'm twice your age now, I was once younger and understand your point of view.  I used to have to ask, ""What does that mean?"" when I'd see references in shows/movies that everyone would laugh at and I hadn't the foggiest idea why."

gaming,This would be amazing for skinny kids in an FPS
gaming,Apart from the epic store sucking donkey balls and people not liking having to install multiple stores? Nothing.
gaming,"oh god, it is happening again. a stupid shit game that is so entertaining just from the stupid factor that we all have to crash the servers trying to download it and all the live streamers are going to play this shit for hours on end, and it will be like this is the only game to ever exist in 2019 for a solid month. Then no one cares again and the meme kids looking to get that dead horse karma bring out their bats for this poor pinata."

If steam gets some competition then that means developers are going to push steam for larger profits and steam will strive to be a better platform. I also don't understand why people don't research the whole RL situation. It's for the betterment of the company and it won't even impact players. You don't have to even switch to epic if you have it on steam, the support is still there. Do some research before shitting all over things you don't understand."

gaming,"&gt; post user reviews

Why, so trolls can review bomb games for reasons outside the quality of the actual game?

&gt; buying the competition from steam

As someone who's been playing games on PC since 1992, Steam had to pull similar stuff when they were first getting off the ground.  I didn't have good enough Internet to use Steam until well after Steam became popular, and when I'd buy a PC game, just to open the case and find a f---ing download code, I'd be s.o.l. because most stores that sold PC games wouldn't do refunds on opened product."

gaming,"The problem I've experienced with Fallout NV GotY edition is that it's very unstable. Crashes frequently, freezes on the loading screen and sometimes even my save games get corrupted.

That being said, there are a few ways around most problems with mods. But even after all the mods I could find to make it more stable, it still would crash or freeze up on me sometimes.

Still a great game to have."
gaming,Thanks for the gold friend! :)
gaming,"How will it possibly be better for a game to make it available to a smaller audience? The epic store offers nothing that Steam doesn't have, except a smaller install base."
gaming,"&gt; We already have basically all the technology needed

lol"
gaming,"Epic- most upcoming AAA titles
Steam- Indie/Early Access Alpha games

Since Epic launcher bought EAC and is currently in negotiation with IR.deto about the upcoming Denovu Anti Cheat ...i doubt that major releases will be on steam anymore.
Either the Dev/Publisher grps use their own launcher Store...Like Massive/Ubisoft ...or it will be on Epic.
For most of these multi billion$ Companys, Steam just offers to much to the User.

hoo boy here we go"
gaming,"dont you come here with your ""gamers are entitled"" bullshit, im tired of assholes saying that all the time like these big corporations are the victim in all this.

i'm pissed at epic because they think the idea of a competition is holding games as hostage, not providing better service than their competitors. i dont blame small indie developers for taking the deals but the big ones have no excuse.

the issue with the launcher is simply the hassle of having to remember and keep safe several accounts to be able to maintain my games (something i was willing to do until epic started their bullshit) right now it's a simple war on principles, i refuse to give epic my money until they stop buying exclusives, i only open exceptions to indie, struggling titles (however one could argue that forcing these indie devs to only publish their games on epic is also damaging them, they can sell much more by publishing on both steam and epic than just on one of them)"
gaming,You can do it man!
gaming,"If you think that Ready Player One is when we started this, think again."
gaming,That's one hell of a commute.
gaming,"Damn dude, you have mommy issues? Calm yourself. Its not that serious."
gaming,"Here's an interesting proposal: how would you feel if Epic split off the store into a completely separate and independent business entity which operated solely as a gaming marketplace, with said entity ceasing any and all first-party publishing and game production? Put differently, would you prefer a platform that functions as a big, neutral ground, level playing field gaming marketplace open to all publishers big and small and whose operators are forbidden from promoting and selling any of their own brand, in-house game products, titles, and services?"
gaming,Think that was a superman parody.
gaming,I actually met one of my best friends while broadcasting a game on steam. I offered to play with him if he bought the game I was playing.
gaming,So the exact same thing Valve did with TF2 and CS:Go?
gaming,"Great hair, you're fooling everybody."

gaming,"I could make a separate post but this is something I've been curious about, do you know if it's terribly difficult to download mods?"
gaming,They gonna update that shit like Orange Box on console
gaming,That's because people don't react with their money. So often people pay for something without asking questions and then they come back shouting when they realize they wasted money on something.
gaming,"2 weeks, yup super dead"
gaming,You can totally bring the product to a new store without removing it from the old one.
gaming,"The issue is that they most likely plan to remove the game from the Steam store. Of course, those who bought it get to keep it, but it’s unclear whether they’ll get DLC or updates in the future."

Little do those people know, the future, if I had to hazard a guess, is going to be all about that shit. When it becomes really advanced those same people will love it, guaranteed. 

Hell, even my microbiology prof was trying to recruit some of the students to learn about gene regulation with VR. I passed on the offer because I knew it would be pretty poor visuals and whatnot, but I can definitely see VR going a lot further than open world zombie games that actually feel and look real (my dream lol)."
gaming,Not my dreams! Thats where I keep all my money and bitches and happiness! NOOOOO!!!
gaming,Any love for Shower With Your Dad Simulator?
gaming,Then buy all the guns in the world and make them exclusive to Epic Guns Store (EGS).
gaming,"The properties cost $2750 to fully develop. Suffice it to say, it will take a long time to build that up, considering the fact that few people land there. Let's say you have three houses. That's $900 for Park Place and $1400 for Boardwalk, if my memory serves.

I suppose your point is valid to a certain extent. But in no way is it a guaranteed win. Note that if you're the only person who's got a monopoly you will win 95% of the time regardless."

The cop cars would always pull up to the same place before hopping out. I'd pop the bombs, pick off the stragglers, and then set more charges in my base while the instant 4-star reinforcements arrived.

The follow-up would be to hop in whatever vehicle I had parked out back, in order to intercept the train and ride to safety. Secondary bombs would be detonated to thin out any pursuers and to look cool...

Sorry man but I didn't find it as scary compared to Outlast 1 and 2, Fatal Frame 2 and 3 or Silent Hill 4.

Dead Space 1 was scarier than Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 1 wasn't scary at all. The only scene to actually make me jump is when you enter the lift to go up from the bridge to fix the asteroid cannon in chapter 4 and you get that random ass scream playing out of nowhere.

Dead Space 2 is the superior game personally, but it definitely is more action packed and less horror than Dead Space 1. Don't even get me started on Dead Space 3.

Like I said, I personally feel horror and sci-fi doesn't mesh well together."
gaming,We will just agree to disagree lol I understand your numbers and they make since but for my strategy it tends to work for me. I've played hundreds of games of Monopoly and I would guess that you have to. Some things work for you and some things work for me. Good discussion though 👍

Steam wasn't built in one day, nor one year. Everyone hated Steam the first few years, nobody wanted the orange box to be digitalized (enter key and have it in some 'unsafe digital library'). Also, Valve and Steam constantly fucked up their updates, breaking stuff etc.

Development wise Epic started in circa 2011 in comparison to Steam development cycles, but Epic plans to bring a lot of stuff in the months to come.

The Epic Store sucks atm if you compare it to today's Steam, but if you compare it to the cycle of Steam, they're far far ahead.

gaming,"There are very few technologies that could be considered 'new' when they became a big deal. 

The tech that made cell phones possible existed since the 1940s, but that doesn't really matter when you're talking about cell phones. What matters is when people began to adopt them and the infrastructure grew to accommodate the new users, and that happened in the '80s. So you could look at cell phones in the 1980s and say ""well yeah it recently quality jumped and got popular, but nothing about it is *new*,"" but that would absurdly ignore the massive societal impact they've had.

Technological advance doesn't come in seperate leaps of individual brilliance. It's a slow trudge forward until finally the theory becomes practical enough to reach a tipping point where it can be adopted by industry, and eventually become ""the new normal""

This could be that point for VR. I'm not certain it is, but I wouldn't be surprised."

gaming,"It’s not about big or small corporations, it’s about this attitude that the entire world has to conform to your preferences. It’s a free market, you are not being forced to buy their games.

Please explain how indie developers are being forced to publish on Epic? Are you trying to say Epic should charge more commission so developers are not tempted? How can someone be that delusional.

I’m not a fan of the Epic store, and I’m not going to buy games on it unless they offer the features I want. If this is not entitlement then I don’t know what is. You are literally asking for the Epic store to change their strategy and developers to pay extra commission just so you can use your favourite launcher. Let that sink in."

gaming,"Modding is simple. It doesn't have Steam Workshop support, so you'll have to mod the old fashioned way.

Head on over to [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas), make an account, and download the nexus mod installer. Once that's set up, which is a fairly automated process, getting most mods is really easy. With New Vegas installed, you can just browse around for mods you like, enter their page, and download using the mod installer, rather than manual install."

I tend to be a muscle head tank so I can shrug off damage while dealing a lot of my own.

Also there’s an entry price point, around $400 for a non-mobile setup. That’s a lot of coin for a gaming system that’s designed for casuals and not competitive players.

The only thing that changes between steam and epic on the consumer side of things is that consumers are forced to go without several features, and have their data at risk.

People aren’t complaining about competition, they are complaining about the way epic is going about it. Developers selling out to epic is just a further normalisation of this shitty business model. 

If epic is meant to be competition then why do they need to buy exclusivity deals and force fans to use their platform? If they were competitive regarding user experience they wouldn’t need to, people would naturally migrate towards an easy to use, functional platform. Epic is none of those."

gaming,"Can you really just turn your brain off and not think watching TV? I've never understood the comment that ""you don't think when watching TV"" because I do think when watching TV, and can't shut off my brain if I wanted to, but I now know I'm not neurotypical and it makes me more curious about something I just thought must be wrong. I also thought parts of humour proved you think when watching TV because the element of surprise won't work if you aren't expecting something to happen when instead something else happens. Not to mention trying to follow complex show plots (which is actually made harder by the way I think, but I imagine not thinking at all would make that hard too...).

Is it an exaggeration or do some people really turn their brain off and essentially not think when watching things? 

I don't really have a preference of gaming vs TV myself as I love gaming in all forms (not just video) but I also love certain shows, but I just have never understood that argument about TV watching. I agree it is hypocritical to criticise gaming but be okay with TV watching or social media - I just find the thinking statement people make intriguing as I can't relate."

Graphically speaking, the technology is definitely there. You just need a PC beefy enough to handle VR and produce near photorealistic video output, a several hundred dollar VR headset and you’re good to go. Motion controls on the other hand are primitive by comparison.

I can only think of one genre where you can get a lifelike experience and that is racing. Of course you’d need a proportionally identical controller setup in the real world to actually make you feel like you’re in the car, so getting a setup that feels similar to being in the interior of a sports car is going to cost thousands of dollars, but yeah, you could simulate the experience of driving a car rather realistically

&gt; Little do those people know, the future, if I had to hazard a guess, is going to be all about that shit. When it becomes really advanced those same people will love it, guaranteed.

This. So much this. Gamers are always late to adopt things. They're also never the drivers of the industry. All advancements in gaming happened because developers pushed for them, not because gamers asked for them. Like analog sticks, multiplayer gaming, and 3D graphics. Basically all driven by developers because gamers could not comprehend their appeal beforehand.

As harsh as it sounds, gamers need to be force-fed advancements because they are too stubborn to accept new things."
gaming,"&gt;Blind brand loyalty that's what you have.

Incorrect. 

Valve is a retailer with an established record of delivery and service reliability. For 15 plus years. 

Conversely, the Epic Store is an objectively, measurably, ***much worse*** experience. It is not comparable in features, like say with offline mode and family library sharing (just to name 2 features I use on steam off the top of my head).

If they had put $$$ in to store development, and actually came up with useful features and a comparable experience, then we wouldn't even be having this conversation. We'd all be decrying the death of steam. 

2 years ago, Epic's cash cow was the Unreal engine and it's associated licensing and store. Fortnite (and then whatever international conglomo) injected ***billions...***  they then took a wordpress t-shirt store theme and tossed it up on the web to call it ""a game store"".

It's just plain bullshit."

Edit: Seriously speaking, an online conference where each person is at their own workspace/shop where they can immediately apply what the professor is teaching/doing would legit be cool. Its like those YT tutorial vids but interactive. Tho, it may just end up like an online classroom at worst, but being at your own venue can have its advantages. Or I dunno what I'm talking about."

gaming,"&gt; I don’t see VR becoming anything more than a silly gimmick that developers are sinking silly amounts of money into.

Ignoring the literal world-changing uses of VR for our daily lives, like being able to visit anywhere and anyone, gaming in VR is already not a gimmick. Are you aware that some of the highest rated games of 2017/2018 are VR games? We'd be seeing these things as front runners as the game awards if they were more well known. Perhaps Valve's Half Life VR game (likely launching this year) will do that.

VR is definitely going to be a core part of gaming, and maybe even the core of gaming itself, because it encompasses all games and genres, and can provide improvements for most of it.

&gt; There’s a reason why Microsoft hasn’t hopped on the VR gaming train - because they’re not stupid.

For GPU I went for gtx 1060 6gb video card, it is quite better than 1050 and it is actually a VR ready so you could play it If you ever decided to.

For CPU I got I5 8600k. Sad to say but I'm not really knowledgeful about cpu so I went one that was best for gaming and had a reasonable price based on reviews and ratings.

I also wouldn't suggest using coolers that come with cpu. Also don't be afraid to spend more on a better cooler since it is really important to have a proper one for gaming. I am currently at work so I can't remember which one I bought.

I picked Gigabyte Z370P D3 as my motherboard since it does what it says. It is a decent motherboard for a reasonable price. Also before you buy your motherboard check if all other parts are compatible with it.

As for memory, I would say pick up a hard disk and SSD one. SSD are much faster than hard disks but are more expensive so you could buy a small one for your windows and a hard disk for everything else. To show how was it is, It takes me 10 seconds to turn off and on my pc.

It's not fine. It's even worse. The disconnect is more apparent when you have a real world reference and obviously not real virtual objects.

This can be quickly mitigated though. Varifocal displays are pretty likely to be part of gen 2 VR."

multiplayer games can’t even handle complex physics with 32 or 64 players. VR software is horrid. And the closest environments to RP1 are nightmare scapes of basically minecraft level “realism.”

Haptics are pure shit right now, a full body sensory suit? lol good luck with that.

it’s a book from 8 years ago that was turned into a trashcan movie, that completely missed the point of the book.

i realized this when i did VR and battletech in 1991: emulating reality requires a computation engine that, you know, is the size of reality.

more affordable? yeah no shit, you’d need a server farm the size of google to even handle realtime rendering of 1/10th the power of “realistic.”

You think everyone will have 10x the power of google in their apartment “just around the corner?”

I don’t want multiple different game libraries from multiple stores. I want one game library, and one store that has all the games I want. EA and Epic are not offering competitive services, they’re offering locked in, contained ecosystems where they hold game properties hostage just so they make an extra couple bucks. If they had even a fraction of Steam functionality and features in their clients then I would consider them approaching competitive. 

None of that matters though once Halo MCC comes out so meh"

&gt;	Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.
So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say."

The statement is VERY carefully worded and any time you see something that carefully worded you have to ask “what are they avoiding saying but instead hoping you will believe?” And in this case they never said it will be available to purchase from steam in the future.

Oh and I am willing to bet that future DLC will be Epic store exclusive. So if you want to play the game you own on steam, with the new stuff... sorry."

Actually, yes. I have seen a few people say this exact statement before. Someone said if they can't kiss someone in VR, then it's not VR and they aren't interested. It's sad that people need every little detail to be perfect to meet their standards. I mean it's okay, because they can't comprehend how good it would be 50% of the way there and would be easily convinced by getting a demo at that time."

I really want a Game with aging progression...visible alteration after fights...weight gain loss etc etc."
gaming,"You're joking right now but yes, it gets exponentially worse. The only advice I can give you in good conscience is to try to stop paying attention."
gaming,"No, it didn't. Steam has never enforced any kind of exclusivity, and even encouraged devs to sell their games elsewhere as well. If you're a dev and have a game on Steam, you can generate as many Steam keys as you want and sell them yourself, and you don't have to pay Steam's 30% cut that way. It's always been that way, and Steam has probably lost a shitload of money doing it, but they're big believers in having an open platform. Devs chose to release on Steam because there's a large built-in audience and plenty of options for discoverability. It was never, ever the only choice.

Locking down games exclusively to a store is fucked for consumers, though."

Against who? Almost every VR multiplayer game is only for VR users.

&gt; You’re taking the freedom of real life and combining it with the anonymity and consequence-less world of video games. That’s a recipe for disaster.

No it's not. It runs on software. Therefore you can have safety options, personal bubbles, rude gesture detection, blocking, muting, pausing.

gaming,"Not to mention it makes perfect sense why Epic prioritizes attracting developers to their platform over pushing out user features. Ultimately it's content that drives people to a platform.

The last cod I really enjoyed was black ops 1 and full step out of it when it went future tech."

Dollars to doughnuts, there are few things that I've gotten more bang for my buck than video games. I spent $10 on Garry's Mod and have enjoyed over 500 hours playing that game. Minecraft was $15 when I bought it and I literally couldn't count the hours of enjoyment I've had.

I'm in an unusual position in that I didn't graduate college and start working full-time until I was 26, and it was only then that time really started passing fast. The weeks go by fast because you *want* them to for the most part even if you like your job (and I do).

If you can, take vacations, pick up new hobbies, and do other things that add ""milestones"" to your life more frequently. It helps provide baselines when perceiving the time that's already passed, and that helps life feel longer."
gaming,"It's *de facto* exclusivity.  Steam essentially had a monopoly on PC gaming for years (in the mid-2000s, for most games it was either you play on Steam or you play on console), until EA decided to do their own thing with Origin.

Epic Game Store is still rather young, and therefore doesn't have the install base that Steam has.  Therefore, devs need an incentive to have their game available on a smaller platform (whether that's permanent exclusivity, or timed exclusivity like Borderlands 3).  Once the Epic Game Store is in a better place with regards to sales numbers, I wouldn't be surprised to see many games release on both."

gaming,"Yeah i misspoke. I meant that exclusives on pc are meaningless vs console. Console exclusives give value to the console and drive people to buy the console. This is THE ENTIRE REASON why ps4 is dominating the market right now. Look at the true exclusives list for ps4 vs xbone. Ps4 has weeks worth of gameplay hours available. Xbone has like 10-12 exclusives at the end of the console's life. 

On PC a company has no reason to purchase an exclusive. But epic is doing just that because they are being petty. Exclusives have no meaning and serve no purpose on PC. But Epic is doing it anyways because ""fuck steam?"" I don't believe that for a second. They are doing the exclusives because they do not want to compete with steam. 

They want to create a monopoly while calling steam a monopoly. But everyone forgets that the monopoly was not created by shady business practices or by ruthless tactics. It was created because steam has consistently provided the best product and the best service to its customers.

I guarantee you. GUARANTEE YOU. Epic will not have anywhere near the kind of sale that steam has come summer. At most they will offer metro at like 20-30 percent off and offer fortnite bundles.

I know this because I used to not have Internet that was good enough to allow me to use Steam, as any game download would have taken days.  Therefore, I was essentially forced to play console games only for a few years until I was in a situation where I *could* get good enough Internet, and even then, there wasn't really an option for most games outside of Steam."

gaming,"I don't forgive him, and I don't forgive that hairline.  Weak genes."
gaming,"Epic doesn't get the money (as I said, it works identical to how Steam does it) but you do need their launcher.  But yeah if the launcher is the primary reason then that doesn't change.  Though Borderlands 3 is confirmed to have an offline mode so it should be possible to run it without the launcher after changing its startup options.

Personally I don't mind the multiple launchers, thats already been sorta ruined (honestly in part Steams fault for their large cut, as thats why drove companies like EA, Ubi, and Bethesda to jump to their own deals) but not a fan of Epic's business practices myself.  But as the keys generated by Epic work the same way as they do with Steam, that means they don't get a dime from said sales either if done via other stores."
gaming,Wait what does unreal engine have to do with Epic?
gaming,"I’m glad someone has their head right around here. Totally agree. That game was damn near perfection. It was simple which was a big part of its greatness. No picking killstreaks. Just always uav, artillery, then the dogs. No death streaks. It was just a good game."
gaming,"I doubt it, but I want it so badly I'm going to upvote you."
gaming,Absolutely right. MW2 is great. But CoD 4 is the peak of CoD for me. Nothing like calling in an airstrike and killing yourself and everyone else on Shipment.
gaming,Just a 16 year old living his life but ok buddy. Sorry that steam has failed you too
gaming,Also in a Die Antwoord song
gaming,MW2 was literally unplayable at the time. People duplicating care packages and using one man army noob tubes. O and the glitch where you blew up when you died. And mw3 was the best selling game because call of duty was on a high. Mw3 was the last good selling call of duty for a reason. It turned off the entire player base

gaming,"Linux gaming has been making huge strides recently. Just because you don't know about it, doesn't mean that you know everything about it. Crazy how that works right?

Linux users should absolutely not make consessions here. The Linux community wants to game as well. They shouldn't be shunned because they don't like/trust Microsoft or Apple.

Your analogy doesn't work either. A better analogy would be:

Your friends bought an indie title on Xbox One a week ago. You didn't have the scratch for it then, but you saved up. You go to buy it, and it turns out you can't play it on your Xbox One anymore. You need to buy a little something extra to do that. That little something extra will slow down your Xbox, fill it full of Spyware, and cause a shit storm of problems that never stops."
gaming,Did anybody else think that the windows and mirror were monitors attached to a motorized chair?
gaming,"Well, one of the best analogies I have heard is first, count to fifty out loud. That seems to take a while. Now count (starting again at one) to a hundred and fifty. It takes way longer, and getting to fifty seems like it still takes a while, but by the time you get to one hundred and twenty, you will look back and see that it was no time at all.

Aging is like that. When you are five, a year is a fith of your life (20%). When you are fifty, a year is a fiftieth of your life (2%). The time flies because it is fractionally less than what you have experienced before. Counting from fifty to fifty one doesnt seem like much of a difference when looking at it from the perspective of fifty or one hundred and twenty, but one to two is double the time."
gaming,"Ah MW2, the first game i played in my teens where I stayed up till 6am the first day I discovered it and didn’t even realize I had binged 12 hours straight. I’ve binged on civ games in recent years but I definitely feel like a degenerate slug every time"

Also Tim Sweeney still is a piece of shit according to basically himself talking but a broken clock is right twice a day essentially."
gaming,Steam started out just like this. Almost exactly like this. It sparks good competition problem is epic needs time to finesse their launcher. This is the same thing that steam went through.

gaming,"Not being a huge Halo guy, and coming to the MCC way, way, late - What was wrong with it at launch?

Being only a loose fan of the series, I feel like 343 are basically re-learning what Bungie learned when they started off. The things I see complained about (and have complained about myself; EG: The split narrative of 5 (although I was happy to see Buck) - I disliked that in H2 as well, and both Bungie and 343 did that splitting the narrative with their second entry into the series (Not counting MCC because I can't remember when that came out, and because it's not really a ""new"" entry in the same way that 5 and 2 were)) had similar counterparts in the original games until Bungie refined things.

That said, I feel like that's often the case with new devs in an established game series. I've said very similar things about ME1-3 and ME:A.

And, to be clear, I don't mean that the flaws don't exist - I mean that there were also flaws in the earlier games, but as the original developer improved their games release after release, rose tinted glasses make people forget the original flaws.

Couple that with the uncertainty of a new set of developers in the IP that most fans have grown up with by that point and you get a lot more scrutiny than the original developers would have received, and flaws are often perceived as bigger than they really are."

Epic is buying games that say they will launch on Steam or have been for half a decade, putting them on an exclusivity timer for elsewhere. And it's also barely functional as a store, worse than every other competitor, is not a different new thing and every single fucker who likes it is a certified piece of shit like Sweeney himself who works his employees to death on minimum wage and the head of Gearbox who stole tons of money from a publisher to make Borderlands 2. 

Only morons honestly compare Epic today to Steam of today. Epic is the 6 to 8th store to launch, is worse than all of them, and is anticonsumer with no features to make it worth anything. I really hope Epic goes bankrupt or kills off the Game Store and Sweeney before it dies."

- Gears of War

- Crysis

- Shadowrun

- The motherfucking Witcher

- every single fucking Call of Duty game had a non-Steam version, now they don't even release on Steam anymore

All of those games succeeded on PC without Steam in the mid-2000s. I can keep going if you want. I thought they had a monopoly? Or is it possible you have no idea what you're talking about? lol"
gaming,United Offensive was where it began for me.  CoD 4 is where it ended.  Played so much S&amp;D on UO. We played in servers that let you earn more grenades and better loadouts as you got more kills. If you had 2 grenades you could set trip wire but it took a while so it was a risk.  At one point they had where you could grapple up walls.  You don't have that passed 4 or maybe WaW.
gaming,"This doesn't make much sense. I guess it's technically possible for the server to cause that latency by holding onto messages for 12 seconds before replying but it seems unlikely that this would be a problem specific people get. 

I would consider all possible points between client (your pc) and server, and what other local network devices were using the internet.

Do you play lots of other online games?"
gaming,"Witcher 3, hands down."
gaming,Bingo. It’s not competition when one is a clear and proven winner and the other is trying to force competition through shady tactics instead of building a product worthy of being a competitor by itself.

gaming,"On one hand, kudos to Epic for wanting to support the hard working people that make games. On the other it feels like it's all bullshit to become the next EA. If they really wanted to support devs, you wouldn't take their games away from a platform (Steam), that has hundreds of millions of users to bring over to your platform that probably only has a very fraction of users that play anything else other than Fortnite. They are just going about this the wrong way right now. Grow your platform beyond just Fortnite and give people a reason to install along side Steam, such as sales more often, bonus perks, better support, etc. I know Epic is rolling in money, but if you sour the taste of your company with people, they won't go back."

Sucks for people who can't afford a console though.
Also consoles have so man many disadvantages. 
Having your browser open and tabbing out to turn on music or to Google something. Not on a console. Want the same prices? Games on the xbox store are more expensive (only 10 bucks but for someone whose weekly income is 20 that is something). Mouse and keyboard? Well yes if you buy extra adapters so the console will recognize input correctly.
It is sad but consoles still have so many many disadvantages. And what's bugging me the most is that these problems could be fixed easily. How hard can it be to implement a keyboard support for example."

gaming,"[Yes they did](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-05-01-epic-acquires-psyonix-will-remove-rocket-league-from-sale-on-steam-later-this-year)

The talk about the game no longer being supported is all just rumors and the usual reddit freakout.

From Psyonic: ""Rocket League will remain on sale through Steam, and Psyonix says it will ""continue to support"" the game on Valve's platform. Speaking to Variety, the developer clarified that Steam users will continue to receive ""patches, DLC and all other content that hits the PC version of the game through the Epic Game Store"".""

And from Epic ""The PC version of Rocket League will come to the Epic Games store in late 2019. In the meantime, it will continue to be available for purchase on Steam; thereafter it will continue to be supported on Steam for all existing purchasers.""

I don't think thats terribly vague, the specify the game will get all patches, DLC, and other content the version on Epic.

So it will be sold on Steam until it's Epic launch, after-which it will likely be only sold on Epic's store.  It will be supported indefinitely on Steam even after said Epic launch, at least so long as Rocket Leauge is alive."
gaming,"Jesus christ. You'd think they'd been clubbing baby seals.

Competition in the market is GOOD! Steam monopolizing the market is NOT good for consumers; driving down the piece of the cake taken by the hosting platform is ultimately a good thing for consumers.

You don't like the epic store? Sure, I get that. It's an inferior platform right now. It doesn't have your friends list, your entire library a bunch of features. That will improve over time, and for now you can either choose to not use it and don't play the games published there, or put up with the extreme inconvenience of adding your game from the other platform to the desktop during installation.

I'm totally fine with companies choosing the publish their games exclusively on another platform. Because it doesn't MATTER where I launch the games from; just that I have access to them! I LIKE that companies are getting a bigger piece of the pie they baked, Steam take a 30% piece slice out of the bottom line for pretty much every game launched there! If going to epic and getting a better deal helps put even a cent more into the development budget for my favorite studios, EVEN if that means some corporate fat cats can get the lions share in their bonus check, I don't mind, because that's more money than before going to where it's needed.

Exclusivity? What a freaking joke, you still play it on the PC don't you?! We're not talking about completely different consoles here, or split player bases. You guys are acting like it's the end of days because you have to install another launcher on your computer. 

A couple of years ago we were all panicking about steam making their own OS to avoid microsoft store schennagians; if you think they still aren't moving towards a complete departure from windows in the future you're a fool. Businesses like valve which have almost complete market dominance need to be kept on their toes, and for that Epic should be applauded, even if their main product is marketed towards annoying teenagers wanting to bang mothers and live the dream of becoming a twitch streamer.

I've thus far stayed well clear of these discussions, but it's been constant and grating. No freaking more. You guys are bemoaning the loss of minor convenience as though epic spends its free time pouring oil into the Atlantic.

The market has responded to Valve's dominance of the market. Epic has the money and the drive to go head to head with them, and developers and publishers are responding positively to the opportunity to increase revenue without increasing costs. It's win win for the consumer.

rant over. Cudos if you made it this far.

&gt; Development on the platform began in 2002, and after a successful beta it launched on September 12, 2003. It wasn't that big a deal. The service wasn't mandatory for all Valve games, and was only really useful if you were playing a game (or mod) like Counter-Strike or Day of Defeat.

The orange box, when steam actually started to get their shit together, forced steam on you. This came out in 2007. A full 4 years after steam launched. After 4 years of steam being available they, mostly, fixed the memory issues. They reduced load times, created the friends list, and started offering yearly sales. 

You are wrong on many counts because you are forgetting 1 important thing. There have been many contenders over the years to try and topple steam. They ALL crashed and burned, or only sale their own titles. 

Games for windows live came out before the orange box as well. That service was crap and it failed miserably. 

Then there was Xfire. A service that was QUICKLY replaced when steam created friendlists. Everyone hated xfire. 

There is one called itch.io which only sales indie games. No one I know has actually used it. There is the horribly named Gamersgate. This existed before the controversy and has nothing to do with that movement. But its terrible and no one uses it. 

Origin only sales EA titles plus a few others which no one buys because its on steam anyways. 

Uplay only sales ubisoft games plus 1-2 others which no one buys except on steam. 

Battle.net... the service which people on steam go. ""What is your battle.net account so we can play?"" 

GoG... sales game which people inject into steam. 

The reason why steam is top is because they have the BEST service. 

Do not lie to yourself and say they are only on top because they were the first. Steam has more features, better service, and a better store than epic does. 

Hell epic does not even have a shopping cart. Fucking what?"
gaming,"AR is pretty much dead... it was a fad like when every monitor had a 3D feature and every movie wanted to be in 3D... 
occulus rift created a huge hype. Occulus came and went. Now its a niche market that lives on a few people. It does not have a killer app and the hardware is basically bulky goggles and bulky claw controllers which only allow to „claw“ things.



3D was born dead and so is VR."
gaming,What? Are you serious? Lmfao. Kids blaming the parents now for time perception speeding up. I’ve fucking heard it all now. 😂

I understand that it's strange. I never met him in person, but I watched his videos almost religiously.

The news came of his departure came as a complete shock. It still shocks me to this day. Many of the people I look up to seem to be taken before there time, so maybe it is this pattern in my life that makes me contemplate him often...

Regardless. I take this specific month to remember a man that endlessly entertained me and inspired me beyond belief.

May he never be forgotten."

gaming,"Assuming you get the same level of medical care in your coma as people in the anime, then the SaO world is genuinely preferable for multiple reasons. The main one being that you could achieve literally anything in that world that you want assuming you don’t die. Since mobs respawn you’d have infinite resources, just grind on the first floor forever and live in a small house for the rest of your days.

If you could completely transfer your consciousness to a VR world and survive without leaving if, it would be preferable to real life under any circumstances."

gaming,"The hate for steam was just as big then, than it is for epic now. People just like to complain.

Also I would say that Sony is even worse with their exclusive titles than Epic, since you have to pay a lot of money for the console aka the possibility to even considered buying a game."

gaming,"I think you're mixing up plot and gameplay, he's typically trying to collect chaos emeralds or defeat Dr. Eggman or something for plot, though the gameplay is just collecting rings yes. A Mario movie could make a plot out of him saving Peach and defeating Bowser, even though the game is technically ""a guy just jumping on things"".

I imagine some of the hate comes from live action Detective Pikachu looking amazing and being true to the anime + games, and then this creepy ass hedgehog comes out of nowhere looking so weird that nobody has even ASKED what the plot is because they're so uncomfortable."
gaming,"&gt; At first I wasn’t that jazzed about playing soccer or having a model that looks like the player,

It's something that has to be experienced. The idea is that VR can make you believe you are somewhere else, so VR can also make you believe you are truly with someone else regardless of physical distance. Like facetime x1000."

At worst, they'll be late adopters that pick the tech up after everyone else has been using it for a decade.

Because my point is it's not a sharp - totally in or out - even for the same person, there's a large gradient going from crossing the threshold of adoption through to maximum possible usage - which is in part determined by the quality of the technology and its ecosystem."

gaming,"There's something that tells me that even though Epic gives more to the devs, their platform doesn't reach a fraction of what Steam does. Mostly everyone that uses Epic only does it for one game and one game only and I'll let you guess which. I would love to see total sales numbers for the Epic exclusive games. Good on them for wanting to support devs, but honestly, it feels like bullshit."

It really made the story shine. I do think it was different enough from the movie not to get bored with it, and imo is worth checking out if you have nothing you are really looking forward to in your book que."

gaming,I’ll take two please
gaming,"Because the Rocket League esport scene is teeming with opportunity as it’s one of the only games that is relatively intuitive in terms of ‘gameplay’. Acquiring Psyonix means that Epic Games can pump money into the RL esports scene, attract more orgs and viewership, then fuck it up just like they did to Fortnite. I don’t want to see my favourite game which I’ve invested thousands of hours into used as EG’s take two of managing an esports scene."

gaming,"So tell me how its a monopoly? Please tell me how? Every game on steam, excluding valve games, does not have any kind of exclusivity deal. 

So please educate me on how its a monopoly. I seriously want to hear this. 

Inconvenient fact you probably dont want to hear. If epic did not want to create a monopoly, they would not sign exclusivity deals. 

They would like the game release on steam, gog, origin, and the windows store. Then they would compete with steam by offering a better product at a better price. 

Instead... epic has a storefront and friendslist. 

Tell me. How do you like chatting with your epic friends on your cell phone? Or logging in through the web interface while at work and chatting with your friends? How IS epic doing in that department?

How about refunds for shitty/unplayably buggy games? Or curator groups? Reviews? Wishlists?"
gaming,"Borderlands 2, ECHO, Return of the Obra Dinn, Psychonauts, Deus Ex."

gaming,"&gt; Oh, yeah. Sorry I forgot that big companies don't lie.
&gt; 
&gt; And that site isn't as random as you make it out to be. At least it shows something. If the sales are SO good why can't they share the exact numbers?

Because that information is also important to the devs, moron. Who actually have people they are responsible for reporting to.

I love how you put your blind faith into someone with NOTHING TO LOSE but Epic, a giant company, is just randomly going to lie lie lie for no reason. And they'll apparently lie about something the devs care about! You think the devs would be okay with them lying about their products? No."
gaming,Everytime when a boss in dark souls appeared or when ever I have a gunfight in rainbow six siege. Never think that I can win this
gaming,"Looks nice, but too bad it Will cost too much for the low quality you get"
gaming,"Weird that you would refer to it as a generic FPS - Halo has always had its own ‘feel’, and Destiny is the only game I can think of that had that same gunplay/movement. Modern FPS usually have very short TTK, whereas Halo’s firefights in multiplayer were a tug-of-war with tides that could turn just when you thought they were over.

As for the hype, there’s deep engrained nostalgia in the series.

I grew up as a PC Gamer, but was mostly bound to consoles by friends and certain exclusives. All i’d ever dreamed of was MLG playlists, but with a mouse.

As anyone who has played ElDewrito can attest, a BR with a mouse is an elegant instrument of death."
gaming,"Exclusivity is an anti-consumer behaviour.

If they can be anti-consumer, then I can be anti-publisher.  Simple as that.

If they respected me as a consumer, then I'd give them some respect back.  

Epic has shown over the last 6 months that they have no respect for the consumer.  They think that every consumer is a braindead sheep and that they're entitled to the $80 from every sheep.

Epic Store is a store that only satisfies what publishers want (which is a fat $5m cheque before any sales).  It does not provide any value to me as a consumer."

gaming,"Urgh, I believe the exact words were they will look at every game on a case by case basis and do everything they can to get each game running to modern specs but that different reasons MAY mean they can't for some things. Halo 2 for example has been stated that the physics engine is tied to frame rate, uncoupling that may or may not be easy. And things like FOV sliders might vary between games depending on how each engine handles it. There's a lot still in the air so don't go expecting absolutes, they're being very open about the process so feel free to hope for all these things but don't expect every feature you want for every game in the collection until you get told what each will contain.

Also they're not 'remaking' the games, they're updating the existing games and engines."

gaming,"That's the important part. Yeah, you can buy land and plant trees. But these trees that already exist and are 80+ years old are far more important to the ecosystem than new trees"
gaming,"The whole reason Epic created their own store was to avoid the Steam tax, there is no reason for them to leave the game on Steam. 

I predict they will either remove the game from steam once it releases on the Epic store or cripple it (eg. new content/skins/modes is only from the Epic store version)."

gaming,"&gt; I didn't say it was a lie. I said it was vague.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm say epic has made a vague, unsubstantiated claim in an attempt to make themselves look good.
&gt; 
&gt; I don't see that the Devs have anything to do with this statement directly. Do you have any evidence to support your claim that they approved or provided the evidence behind this statement or are you just making stuff up?

It's not vague in the fucking slightest!

And you literally just questioned its truthfulness again.

This isn't a hard fucking concept for what a good PC launch is.

Good launch: IT SELLS A SHITTON AND WE SWIM IN MONEY

Bad launch: It flops

And I didn't claim that that they did either of those, but if you don't them *disapprove* (which is what I fucking said) then why do you think the devs would let them lie? Because the devs are also random lying assholes? Or because you can't accept simple facts?"

Boo-hoo, I have to make a few more mouse clicks to start my game-- seriously, I don't think I'll ever understand the strong feelings behind having multiple stores/platforms to launch games. It's like being upset that you can't buy everything from fucking WalMart."
gaming,Curious as to why.
gaming,"The hardest part for real life 'Ready Player One' will be copyright control/DRM and development standards. 

Just look at early digital access (post piracy) for stuff like movies and TV. Started off pretty comprehensive and then over time we get more and more video services to subscribe to. We do get more content because there is more sub money to go around, but it means that everyone wants to do their own music streaming, movie streaming etc. You can't just access everything easily. Gotta use special players for each thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

TV casting right now is a great example of how stupid it is. You can't use Chromecast for Amazon Prime Video, can't use Amazon fire stick for various things, can't use Apple TV for everything..and on and on it goes. So instead of me just sitting down with an ipad full of apps and choosing what I want, I have to change devices because I don't actually have all the castable stuff yet (just chromecast).

So it'll be a war between different VR hardware, and then within that space there'll be a whole bunch of attempts to lock you into a format/service."

gaming,"not that I agree with review bombing of older titles, but customer doesn't really have any other way to reach other potential customers and warn them ahead of time about new owner or dev practices etc. and, in steam case, you can filter these out if you want to read reviews only about the game itself, that's what it is for afterall"

&gt;Competition in the market is GOOD! Steam monopolizing the market is NOT good for consumers; driving down the piece of the cake taken by the hosting platform is ultimately a good thing for consumers.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, first I haven't read the rest of the comment but I will.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, people AREN'T upset that Epic is challenging Steam. People ARE upset about how they are doing it. They are buying shit outright and holding it hostage on the Epic store. How is that helpful to consumers? You are simply forcing people who want to play certain games to buy it on Epic instead of being forced to buy it on Steam. 

&amp;#x200B;

I agree, competition is a good thing. The way Epic is going about it, however, is not. They aren't truly competing are they? I mean for fuck's sake, a shopping cart is a long term goal for the store. They don't have reviews! If Epic wanted to compete with Steam, then fucking do it. Don't go around buying up studios and games and then try to be all high and mighty about how it's good for the consumers when it actually restricts choice even more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to finish reading the comment now, maybe I'll edit some other stuff in after."
gaming,"Well, because I would say outside of the reddit circlejerk, the casual players don't really care a lot for most of these features. I never really understood the cards you get and I'm not an achievement hunter. Neither do my friends. We all work and don't invest a lot of time into gaming and just buy games we like here and there. I would say there is a huge group of people like us and a lot (maybe most) money to be made.

As far as I am concerned I'm pretty happy that steam gets a bit competition. While for the end user it seems like that there is not much improvement and more of a downgrade, hopefully epic give more money to the devs (and it looks like it when they shift to the epic store), where steam takes a huge cut of every sale."
gaming,Let it happen. Maybe valve will release some sequels already if they actually needed money.
gaming,"&gt;even after Origin was released.

No. the BFs, Anthem, Apex, Fifas, Madden, and a handful of others are exclusive to Origin for PC.

But that's EA's right as they are the studio that makes it and publishes it. They are under no obligation to sell their product on Steam. 

In my opinion Apex is the attempt to get people to have Origin on their PC. Similar to FortNite and Epic Games. Except Origin existed already as a storefront."
gaming,"I'm sad that no one in the thread mentioned the original Doom. It was such a big part of my teenage life. I still play gzdoom from time to time and I like how you can tweak that engine so it looks like 320x200x256 @35 fps, just like in original DOS."
gaming,"I thought they were using eyetracking technology to address this - it measures where the eye is looking and ""focuses"" the screen for you. Not only does this help with nausea, it actually lessens the load for the gpu as well, as things outside the focus area don't need as much processing power. I doubt they're there yet, but they HAVE thought of it, and they are fixing it."

gaming,"&gt; The hate for steam was just as big then, than it is for epic now. People just like to complain.

Steam was a better product than CDs.  It was hated for being different.

Epic is just another download store that lacks any and all features.  It's the 8th, roughly, to come out.  It is shit, period and you refusing to accept that is on you and no one else for not explaining it."

gaming,I feel like the default going forward for big AAA VR shooters is gonna be a simplified reloading action. Something like having you a bring up a magazine and slotting it in to be ready to fire.

gaming,"DAE hate Epic Gamez?? XD

I mean EA."
gaming,I’m on NG++++ but listen to music or watch something on my laptop while playing. I only pause it/turn it down when it’s a hard fight.
gaming,"players want to gripe but they dont realize its a better deal for developers in that steam requires 30 percent of profits from steam games whereas Epic's store only gets 12 percent.   Plus considering Unreal Engine is used for a ton of games and the fact that the whole unreal engine launcher and library is integrated into the same app as the store its really a great boon for unreal engine devs too use the same tool to make your game as to sell it.

the only real hassle is for those who dont have an epic account .

honestly considering how many games run with unreal now im amazed epic hasnt had a store till now.

people are just hating because of the whole fallout 76 thing. thats a totally diffrent unit.  But i get it some people might not like it but again since i use unreal engine anyways not anything else i need to do extra lol.

plus if they ever do offer mod support for borderlands 3 (no words yet but could be possible) youd need an epic account to download the mod kit anyways soooooo"

gaming,"I'm not familiar with RL or its recent developments but the issues you're bringing up are matters for the developers to address. The whole idea about Epic buying over RL strongly implies that it will be pulled from the Steam and become a EGS exclusive is not pro-consumer. Unless they explicitly mention that RL will be on BOTH storefronts moving forward then I rest my case. Otherwise, this is not just 'another strong platform' but merely a business practice that will hurt the consumers by not giving us the freedom for alternative, competing store."
gaming,"The DS is a handheld game console that features two screens: a top screen that folds, and a lower touch screen that worked with a detachable stylus the device includes.

Users were required to flip the top screen open to use the DS, and the screen would fix itself on a certain angle (about 160 degrees) when completely opening the device. 

However, some users would use too much force when opening the screen or intentionally push the screen open farther than it should, and the lock that sets the screen to the angle that should be used would eventually wear off, so the top screen would sit at its maximum possible angle when opened (about 190 degrees, as displayed on this picture.)

Usually a DS in this state would be a sign that it's either overused or the user incorrectly uses the DS (and probably uses their fingers on the touch screen instead of the stylus, because it's most likely lost anyways. Those brutes.) These users were mostly children."

gaming,"On the real tho why does fortnite get so much hate? I get that it makes some of you feel cool and edgy to hate something just because a bunch of young kids like it, but I don’t think it’s a bad game. Especially if you’re not bad at it. I want to hear some rational reasons as to why some of you hate it. 

My main point being that it’s free and not pay to win . It is a good precedent for other games because it shows a free game can make tons of money without being pay to win. So show fortnite a little more love. We should be encouraging other game developers to create more free games."
gaming,"I didn’t say dark souls was garbage...I just think the game mechanics are super dull. Slash, block, roll that’s just about it"

Releasing a undeveloped launcher

Using brute force (Buying games) instead of launcher features  
Shady if not illegal EULA  


Now Steam   


Focuses on Features instead of brute force,

gaming,"Another launcher to keep updated?
They all auto update when they launch. Steam, Uplay, Origin, B.net, Epic... (granted you can disable that on most)"
gaming,It’s actually hilarious and a look at old telltale mechanics.
gaming,"It would be nice to see Steam offer a more generous cut of the sale to the developers, at this point steam certainly doesn't need it and it would look like good will all around.

Let's not forget that epic is intentionally not making their store a better place and that this is not competition. Its just anti consumer.

Edit: clarifying, they are WORKING on the new features but theyre prioritizing buying the rights to game sales over making their service better. Nobody WANTS Egs because it offers LESS than steam."

A study published in Nature stated the following:
""Although agricultural expansion in the tropics has swallowed vast areas of the rainforest, climate change has allowed a greater number of new trees to grow in areas previously too cold to support them.
(...)
The research suggests an area covering 2.24 million square kilometers - roughly the combined land surface of Texas and Alaska, two sizeable US states - has been added to global tree cover since 1982. This equates to 7% of the Earth’s surface covered by new trees."""

gaming,MCC was a broken game during launch. Most people could not play multiplayer or coop campaign with stability. It was extremely frustrating and a lot of problems arose since each Halo game ran its own engine and 343 did not figure it all out yet
gaming,"Some of 5's multiplayer was good.  Let's not forget they tried to remove all big team battle maps and game modes in order to push their new microtransaction mode.

Halo 4 had much better big team maps and modes at its launch, they just botched small, competitive maps.

But hey maybe Halo Infinite will get both right... lol"
gaming,"There is a huge difference between needing to purchase a different console in order to buy a game exclusive to that console, and having to download a launcher for free that you don't want to download.  You aren't being forced to buy a brand new piece of hardware in order to purchase and play a game through Epic.  An Xbox player is forced to buy a PS4 in order to play God of War, however.  That's the difference.  You choose not to purchase a game on the Epic store.  Console players don't even get that choice.

You can complain about the shortcomings of the Epic store, that's fair.  But this excuse is bullshit.  This is nothing at all like console wars."

Lets relate this to a real world example. I start a clothing production company to make pants, and one of them that I make is a super popular pair, the Fortnight Threads. Fortnight Treads make be a bunch of money, I'm making absolute mint from these pants. Enough to expand my business. 

I keep hearing from other clothing production companies how greedy the retail giants are with them taking 30% of any sale. I decide it's time to go up against the big boys and open my own store, and anyone who makes clothing can sell their stuff there. I'll price my cut on their products at the the much lower price of 18%.

I might even start aquiring other clothes production companies; maybe there's some shoes I really like, rocket league boots are great! I know that with my capital, their product, and our combined vision, we can go on to make even better products in the future.

Simplistic for sure, but I think it accurately summises the real world market equivalent."

It's probably more that it doesn't take any risks to be a movie true to the game instead of yet another 'Hollywood safe' family film with a cheesy, cliched premise that takes place in our world and has to give some lame excuse for why there's a talking blue hedgehog in it.

Also.  The CGI for Sonic is god damn awful."

A headset to provide visual stimulation, hand controllers, an omni-treadmill with positional tracking and a haptic suit. The seeds and precursors of said tech exist now, it just takes a lot of fine-tuning, bringing together of many disparate parts and streamlining into something cheap and plug-n-play. I'd say 2045 in our time would be pretty safe to bet on, maybe even a little earlier."
gaming,"The PR speak they used left it open ended, and honestly, I interpreted it as they will be removing it after it's on their platform."
gaming,Wow!! Have you made a mirror shield too?
gaming,shes probably from alpha centauri tbh
gaming,Might be. Considering Epic's track record (their own Paragon and Unreal Tournament for instance)...
gaming,"Tries to show a company that they disapprove of their action; which is hilarious, since EGS doesn’t have user reviews, so review bombing is impossible, which can help make it look like a better alternative for a developer."
gaming,"I mean, what tech is presented in RPO? 

A headset to provide visual stimulation, hand controllers, an omni-treadmill with positional tracking and a haptic suit. The seeds and precursors of said tech exist now, it just takes a lot of fine-tuning, bringing together of many disparate parts and streamlining into something cheap and plug-n-play. I'd say 2045 in our time would be pretty safe to bet on, maybe even a little earlier."
gaming,It is in writing though. Their latest Dev update said that was one of their core PC features they're adding for release.
gaming,"Well I am actually too young to remember, I didn't have my own credit card to buy games so I didn't have steam"
gaming,"I came here for this comment, then I upvoted it."

gaming,Trademark Rocket Royale and sell it to Epic

gaming,Well I'm glad he's at least using some on charity and not all of it on random materialistic objects.
gaming,Bet you like CDPR and R* tho
gaming,Because you can play with people across the planet.
gaming,"To be completely exclusive on steam? If so I did not know that. Even though ""they did it first"" is not really an excuse for epic to do it. Especially now when pc gaming is as massive as it is"
gaming,Didn't he sacrifice his arm just to get Al's soul back and tie it to the armor?
gaming,I bet it would cost $4000 and run at 90c idle
gaming,its an alien doing  humanface
gaming,"What I'm saying is there is at least some downtime, not that the industry as a whole isn't screwed."
gaming,"The difference is that those services actually work, for one thing."
gaming,thats just how people look on her planet
gaming,"That's the largest leap I've read during this whole debacle. ""Actually Chinese spyware that actually has backdoors"" - I guess you really needed to say ""actually"" twice, because both of these are great leaps to conclusions compared to what is discussed. Not a nice way to introduce a person out of the loop to an ongoing controversy."
gaming,"it's leaving the steam store, so if someone wants to buy it and play it will need to use the EGS"
gaming,"Seriously, Blonic doesn't blend into that scene whatsoever."
gaming,"They have games from other publishers, most obvious example is Assassin's Creed."
gaming,its her real face. probably an alien honestly

gaming,"I've been a PA on an animated movie.

I guarantee you nearly everybody on the production and creative staff was baffled by the design notes, politely voiced concerns at every opportunity, and viciously mocked them behind the director's back (or whoever pushed for the final design).

It must have been a really depressing production to work on."
gaming,"Haha, what a stalker, doesn't like my argument so stalks my profile and looks for a past comment to mock. ""Oh no there's a game I find difficult, I must be all shit!"". You need to start making arguments that rebuttal the initial statement. If you actually did some research, you'll realise the actual reason why I am against epic games. They do way too much dodgy shit, including using programs that send user info to the Chinese government, use far less than adequate account security, the way they go about obtaining their exclusives being completely wrong and unfair for the consumers, etc."
gaming,Play what you want because piracy's free
gaming,He cares more about trees than the health of his own employees. He doesnt deserve any sympathy.

gaming,And then whines about it on the Internet like a rational adult.
gaming,Forgot to mention also fighting games
gaming,that aint no latina thats a fucking space alien and no wall will keep those freaks out
gaming,"Yup. I used all those words and didn't once use either of the words he claimed it would difficult to describe ""daedra"" without. Because the other comment is correct, they are not ""demonic entities"". And therefore easy to describe without using those words. :)"
gaming,Probably both. Dude is bigger than me now though.
gaming,Did u hear the answer to the gate n my sarcasm as it whooshed over your head? J/k
gaming,But can it run Crysis? 🤔
gaming,"That's quite literally it. Just a bunch of entitled babies whining about needing another launcher and unjustified paranoia about China somehow spying on you, never mind your phone doing that every day as well as all the other companies Tencent has their mits in."
gaming,"""Existing purchasers"" so people that have already bought the game. Not necessarily people that want to buy the game in the future. The wording is very specific, and you have to wonder why. If they meant what you say they meant, why didnt they simply say ""...will continue to be supported on steam."" Adding ""existing purchasers"" changes the context greatly."
gaming,"I didnt visit your profile, i guessed it"
gaming,I always forgive this guy because Fortnite was not always the BR game you know it to be. It used to be a DOA base building horde-based shooter that I was slightly interested in/followed but never really decided to buy.
gaming,"dude thats clearly a hideous alien doing HUMANface,"
gaming,Why forgive him? Can't you protect trees and make sure people work in an enjoyable environment at the same time?
gaming,"It's not entitlement, it's how the free market works. If a company does something that upsets consumers, then said consumers can and should make that heard by not giving money to that company."
gaming,"Nobody is disputing that it's a better deal for developers. The problem lies in the way epic is going about this, essentially using funds to undercut any fair competition based on merit. I don't begrudge developers for taking the deal, it's a good deal. I begrudge epic for their shitty business tactics.  
If they had lured those devs over with nothing more than 'Here we have a better split' then there'd be a lot less issues.

Hell, I wouldn't even have begrudged developers if they had raised the steam price so they'd get the same amount of money per game on both platforms. At that point the steam users would be paying steam's cut if they really wanted to stick to steam.

But using exclusivity contracts to get people tied to your storefront is just shitty. How much of an 'inconvenience' having to use their store is isn't even a factor in that. Although the poor usability of their storefront (which is probably deliberate because a reasonable layout would immediately show their rather small selection of products) isn't really helping acceptance any."
gaming,"This conspiracy that Epic is obligated to give information to Tencent aka, ""Chinese Spy Company"" has been debunked. 

If you wanna do some research, start [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8xi69sBbwo)

Don't get me wrong, I'm with you on the Chinese Government own companies shit. But they don't have controlling shares in Epic, thus don't get to say shit about how to company is run, or access private or sensitive information"
gaming,Every game you've ever loved has had crunch behind it
gaming,I remember my brother got mad at me while he was playing the DS and ended up snapping it in half when it was in that position. RIP
gaming,Indie Games started on Steam. At least the first wave. Developers searched for a distribution platform and Steam helped with the production and promotions. Under the limitation of being exclusive on Steam.

gaming,"Why thoose kids can't go outside or at school and play there, why do they need a VR to play with guns?"
gaming,Incest is one thing but doing that to your ds? You're an animal.
gaming,"They have a huge market share and no serious competition, that's textbook monopoly. Not having exclusivity deals does not preclude it from being a monopoly. 

&gt;Inconvenient fact you probably dont want to hear. If epic did not want to create a monopoly, they would not sign exclusivity deals.

An inconvenient fact you probably don't want to hear. Epic doesn't want the federal government coming to shut them down, they want market shares not a monopoly. Exclusivity deals are a proven way to gain market shares in the entertainment industry, they're just building their brand. 

Signing exclusivity deals is not a sign of monopoly, where are you getting this idea from? Netflix is not a monopoly even though they are the only service that shows The Office. 

&gt;Then they would compete with steam by offering a better product at a better price.

They could also buy exclusives, there is more than one way to get games. Your suggestion is valid, so is epic's strategy.

I'm probably never going to use the Epic launcher since I don't play fornite and the services sound terrible, but its still good for them to put pressure on steam in some way. Consumers only have more to gain in the long run."
gaming,"Steam is more than just the market leader; it holds a huge majority of market share amongst its compeditors. 

Origin, GOG, Blizzard, Discord, Epic, Ubisoft, the list goes on. Most of these have publisher exclusives and cant or wont even directly compete with Steam.

If you think any one of these is even close to competing on the same level as steam you're dreaming.

I'd call that a monopoly.

And how is spending money to launch into a market cheating? How is going head to head with steam and trying to compete not competition?

Epic offers developers a better paycut. That benefits consumers."
gaming,"Why, why dp they hype me up even more!
Really don't want to support epic store, but with this game there might be an exception...."

gaming,My bad I was just imagining the outcome of two brothers with magic fighting over video games. Watch  FMA Brotherhood it is amazing but what u should b4 is correct
gaming,"I don't see a reason why they'd pull a game away from Steam that's already been available there for five years, but okay.

Any explanation for the amount of money they've thrown at developers for Borderlands and Anno? For Borderlands they paid for only for the first 6 months (so they clearly want the initial hype and don't care about exclusivity on their platform aftewards), and for Anno they bought out exclusivity after it had already been announced on Steam."
gaming,What will happen with workshop stuff for people who buy on Epic?
gaming,UPDATE: OP reposts for karma
gaming,"All I can surmise from this image, just bro to bro, is that James Marsden has bills just like everyone else. No judgements from over here.

Also, for perspective, I believe he’s got a pretty good role in the next/final Tarantino movie, which will feature a ridiculous number of current A-list actors and legends. He’s been grinding in Hollywood for *a long time*. And real recognizes real.

Edit: Thought this was gonna be Tarantino’s last film, however Redditors who know better than I, have clarified that he may have a bullet or 2 left in the chamber."
gaming,"this article doesnt exist

dont kid yourself this epic games ceo is just power hungry thinking he can do whatever the fuck he wants just because fortnite became a one hit wonder, wait till valve new vr set blows them the fuck out of the market then they will be eating dirt and planting their own trees instaead"
gaming,Why 100 years? You'd do it for perpetuity.
gaming,"Well, he's got the 'RL' part, at least."
gaming,Nah. The more things I find out about fma the less I want to watch it.
gaming,"They did that so they could even try to compete with steam, since steam is way ahead of any other launcher they need some kind of edge to closer the gap. They could  have just went with cheaper rate (which they do, they take 10% of every copy sold while steam takes 30%) but with exclusives they are trying to achieve their goal much quicker. Sadly, it works. The share amount of people who will use Epic for the games they want will make Epic grow much faster than it has any right to."
gaming,"Just my two cents: I am NOT a fan of Epic store. But people crying now and putting Steam in the position of the savior: Steam was hated like shit in the beginning by the people, because Halflife 2 forced the people to get on Steam. A LOT of piracy happened! A LOT!

Valve paid developers and offered them free promotions and support during development to get them on their platform."

gaming,I think you're overestimating how many people still care about sonic. He died with the Sega Saturn.
gaming,At this point it's more a steamed ham reference...
gaming,Are you sure it's a different one?  For *some reason* they're trying to keep it anonymous.
gaming,I know why they did it. They did it too aggressively with too little to show for it imo
gaming,"I just seriously want my fucking cloud saves. I'm playing on 3 devices and I don't want to lose my progress. If Epic implements it, then the launcher is okay with me"
gaming,Epic Games buying the top spot on R/all...
gaming,One of the few thing i miss about console gaming is that you only have one Launcher you have to update and have all your friends on.
gaming,"have all the same ones except the purple guy in the bottom row, not sure what that is"

gaming,I am sick of this dead news
gaming,"unpopular opinion: I don't hate it. I don't like it, but it doesn't strike me as some eldritch horror, and if the movie isn't bad I could definitely see me watching it (tho it would probably require Jim Carrey to carry this movie hard for me to see it.)

That said, I was never a Sonic fan, didn't play the games, didn't watch the shows, so I don't have the love and nostalgia going into his design. Maybe if I had that nostalgia I would think differently."
gaming,New map for next season
gaming,"Go cry me a river, and stay poor :)"
gaming,"&gt; hopefully epic give more money to the devs 

They won't. That ""extra cut"" everyone keeps pointing out, is actually going to the publishers not the developers. Developers will get fucked just as much, if not more, by Epic. But don't worry, the corporate money men get a bigger percentage, so we should all be on board with it, right?"
gaming,Randomize button is broken here xD
gaming,"Yeah, Tim Sweeney is currently buying plots of forests, but the anonymous billionaire *already* has his island."

But yeah, Valve has become a VR developer."
gaming,The chromatic abberation is messing with my eyes.

gaming,I know what we're all thinking..resist the urge to kill each other hunger games style
gaming,"No one is holding a gun to those employees heads and forcing them to work there, bud. They've clearly weighed the pros and cons and the pros won, otherwise they would be working elsewhere."
gaming,Too lazy to download a new launcher?
gaming,"Yes but the main issue is still with lack of invite mod support and other such advantages that you get from owning a game on steam ie: u can link overwatch to your steam account but you can't invite steam friends to play with you, you still need to go through battlenet for that"
gaming,"Epic is building a better client, but they're using their exclusives to build a playerbase before then. A good number of the steam features have been planned for egs, and though they lack in popularity (now), Epic is at least improving something, unlike valve."
gaming,Yea I can't imagine it changing any developers mind.
gaming,1 month if it bombs. If it doesn't then about 3 months (roughly that long for Soul Calibur to appear in that last sale).

gaming,"Source on Halo 5 being anything but the least popular Halo. Stats I've seen place Halo 5 as about half as popular on launch as Halo 4 a year after release, which was less then a quarter as popular has Halo Reach 2 years after release."
gaming,"Theres a difference between making your own games exclusive to the epic store, and buying out an entire studio, and then making that studios games exclusive to their store retroactively. So yeah, youre comment kinda missed the whole point of what you quoted."
gaming,Woah this is amazing. I never played on VR I just might buy a new VR set try it out.
gaming,"&gt; Second, people AREN'T upset that Epic is challenging Steam. People ARE upset about how they are doing it. They are buying shit outright and holding it hostage on the Epic store. How is that helpful to consumers? You are simply forcing people who want to play certain games to buy it on Epic instead of being forced to buy it on Steam.

I disagree. I think people are annoyed at a minor inconvenience, and are looking for ways to justify their outrage. I love gaming and have been a gamer my whole life, but fuck a duck we can be a salty as shit sometimes.

Take Anno 1800. Some people were salty that sales were stopped on steam and moved to Epic. How does this affect a consumer who hasn't bought the game yet? They have to use a different launcher. How does this affect a consumer who has bought the game already? It doesn't, they've got the game.

&gt; I agree, competition is a good thing. The way Epic is going about it, however, is not. They aren't truly competing are they? I mean for fuck's sake, a shopping cart is a long term goal for the store. They don't have reviews! If Epic wanted to compete with Steam, then fucking do it. Don't go around buying up studios and games and then try to be all high and mighty about how it's good for the consumers when it actually restricts choice even more.

They are slow to deliver features for their platform. Thats not a crime or worthy of boycotting all products as the original replier i commented to talked about. 

As for choice, do we get pissed when development companies self publish? Blizzard gets alot of hate, but not a peep about battle net. Can't buy their games on steam, but by your argument this restricts consumer choice and is thus anti consumer.

No, deep down under all the bluster about how evil epic is with it's shit platform are people just wanting to maximize their convenience and refuse even the slightest compromise.

(Edited for clarity)"
gaming,Ehhhhhh not just yet
gaming,"I cant imagine being so upset over epic that it consumes all my life. Thats what it seems like with you people on reddit and all over the web, its just so pathetic what will make people go insane nowadays."
gaming,Can I get some evidence for those last two sentences?
gaming,"No. Stand up and look straight ahead. Do your eyes magically block out 90% of the floor? Or does your natural field of view provide 50/50 floor/sky when looking at the horizon?

It was a horrible gimmick that as far as I can tell, ONLY Halo did and it's because console shooters are notorious for having such god fucking awful FOV that they needed to optimize where you looked to make up for it. When you're on PC with 90+ FOV, this off centered bullshit just looks vomit inducing."
gaming,"Nice.

But can it run Crysis?"
gaming,"Yes, because epic is the only one that overworks their employees. 

When people in the video game industry say that it is an industry wide problem that affects nearly every triple A game, that only means “vidya” games from companies you don’t like so you can bring it up in arguments.  

Next, please."

gaming,"Removing games from other stores is anti-competitive bullshit. It's not in for any technical reason. They just don't want to make their platform as compelling to consumers as Steam, so instead, they try and force Steam to be worse through exclusive deals. Consumers lose, and we should hold these developers and Epic to account for such Shitty practices.

Also, it's a huge pain in the ass to run games through the Epic games launcher on Linux compared to Steam. So games being removed from Steam is terrible for gamers who don't want to deal with Microsoft's bullshit, either."
gaming,"Just my honest opinion, but no, it's really terribly written"

This dude said ""oh shit"". All you had to do was get the damn quote right."
gaming,People aren't mad cause there are more stores. People are mad because the EGS sucks when compared to competition and instead of being competitive by being better they fuck over consumers with exclusivity and force them onto a lesser platform for their games. I'm all for competition but this ain't it. This is a shack trying to compete with a supermarket by buying products and taking them off their shelves. Not to mention the alleged data harvesting EGS does. That and the info is potentially shared with Chinese Gov.
gaming,Confirmed.. Bringing back wailing woods...
gaming,but then he turns around and pulls all this shit with the egs...
gaming,"Nah, Epic Megagames were respectable. Once that name changed and Tencent got their dirty Chinese claws into 40% of the company that reputation went out the window."
gaming,"Dammit, I just realized I fucked up Master DICE's name intro. Oh well."
gaming,If you want the Soul Stone you'll toss that legendary over the side.
gaming,"&gt; It would be nice to see Steam offer a more generous cut of the sale to the developers, at this point steam certainly doesn't need it and it would look like good will all around.
&gt; 
&gt; Let's not forget that epic is intentionally not making their store a better place and that this is not competition. Its just anti consumer.

Beaten by Black Ops 4 which doesn't even have a campaign. It has become niche. I don't know anyone who even watches the anime anymore because everyone I know who does claims they stopped watching it after Battle Frontier ended.

He said:

""Yesterday's PCs were for people that were working and later playing games, even if those games were lower-end ones. There will always be a market for casual games and online games like World of Warcraft. But at the end of the day, consoles have definitely left PC games behind.""

Seems pretty consistent with Epic's business model."
gaming,"Fuck man. What I’d give to be working in the gaming industry. Sadly I can’t give two shits about learning code. 

As a long time halo fan I really do hope the mcc is everything I expect it to be. Granted, I know these titles are old so multiplayer isn’t going to be a disappointment if I have to que and wait. I look forward to coop and showing my girl what got me into fps games in the first place!"

I doubt you'll stick to this boycott that long. The unreal engine is possibly one of the best game engines available. You would end up boycotting a significant chunk of all major games that will be coming out.

Besides, your enthusiasm is entirely misplaced here. A boycott on a game engine unrelated to the Epic Store is going to have 0 impact on any companies decision to use the unreal engine. No board room says ""well x game using unreal engine sold poorly. Must be the engines fault""

If unreal engine was trash, maybe a boycott could have a tiny effect. But it's not trash. It's one of the most well developed game engines available."

gaming,"When I first moved in to my current apartment, I played Monster Hunter World on a 19"" LCD. Enjoyed it just fine.

But to answer your question... any from last gen, for starters, or maybe early current-gen titles, like Crimson Dragon. Indies, too; Hollow Knight, Dead Cells, Hyper Light Drifter manage to impress without needing too many pixels or polygons.

10tons' line of twin stick shooters (Neon Chrome, Tesla vs Lovecraft) are also great games with simple but beautiful graphics, as is the Ys series (Origin, the best, is on Xbox; I think PS4 has a few more, though it's originally from PC)."

Forget about luxury features that steam has like screenshot galary, game forums, workshop for easy to access mods. Epic store doesn't even have basic features like multi-item purchases. If you want to buy 2 games you have to go through the payment sequence twice. This is just one example of things missing on epic store that is beneficial to the consumer.

But then again why spend time and money adding all these features. Epic store don't care about what their consumers need, they just pay off all the developers to exclusively release the game on their store. Who cares what the consumer wants when you give them no choice but to use their store, right?"

gaming,"You actually have that fucked up. If games weren't exclusive, people would just continue buying them on steam because that's what they're used to. 

What I mean is that to us (the consumer) the price of said game is the same on either store. We would think like this....

""I can buy this on Steam or EGS and its not on sale for either. I guess since most of my games are in my Steam library I'll just buy it from Steam, at the very least for organization."" 

Resulting in developers continuing to be gouged by the hefty royalties valve charges them for the VAST majority of sales. 

Exclusivity forces the consumer to support Epic yes (bad) but it also forces us to help developers reclaim hard earned money (good) that -let's be honest here- Vavle has been ripping them off for because they monopolized the trustworthy storefront scene on PC.  

As much as I hate their store, it will force me to go out of my way a tiny bit, to help out the teams who make some of my favorite games earn the cash they deserve. Because otherwise I would just stick to steam for convenience and never let my favorite developers get their fair share of the sales.

They will get more money which gives them more opportunities. They may get more people on board to relieve stress from other employees, or introduce better bonuses. More money to invest into e-sport structure and so on. Also if they are friends with Epic, they mat get better support as well.  


What worries me more is that Steam is losing a huge cash-cow and seems not to be bothered to a slightest. How many more popular IPs does Steam needs to lose before they wake up?

  
I like one-stop-shop that is Steam but if they don't do something soon, they will become a trash dump for all shit titles and anime tiddy games.

So don't flail around with your 'epic exclusivity' attitude. 

We will see more exclusivity because Epic also produces UE4. About 1/3 of the produced titles are made with unreal engine. It's just a normal thing to make deals with the devs that supported your game engine before.

The problem with Epic isn't ""we want a monopoly!"" (which, again, we already lacked), but ""Epic sucks and if it weren't for exclusives, there'd be zero incentive to use it"".

At 20 bucks a copy, Psyonix only makes around $12 per copy on steam. After 4 years I'm sure the sales have slowed significantly. How can people expect companies to except that kind of gouging and survive. 

Not to mention that we as gamers HATE greedy pricing on games. 

How can we expect developers not to feel like Vavle is being greedy? 

How can we outrage with Psyonix for wanting to make an extra buck, not by gouging US (like most devs will), but by striking back at the guys who take almost half their money from sales.  All while still providing us with one of the greatest cheap games out there.

gaming,"The basic gist is this

* They released a buggy storefront that's missing basic features (it launched with stuff like refunds and a search function missing) like user reviews, cloud saves and achievements

* They've been buying up exclusive launch rights for a bunch of anticipated triple A titles (metro exodus, borderlands 3, Hello Neighbor hide and seek, journey 2, division 2, Shakedown Hawaii, Super Meat Boy forever, Unreal Tournament, World War Z) so you have to use the epic store if you want those games. And recently Ubisoft announced they're going to launch their games on epic and wont make them available for purchase on steam. Epic Games is also owned by tencent, a massive chinese corporation that makes walt disney look like an ice cream truck and has tens of billions of dollars to back up epic games which means more exclusivity deals in future

* Some of Epic games public relations staff have been ...massive pricks to people who bring up valid and legitimate criticisms of the store front.

* They flat out refuse to implement a forum system (like the one steam has where people can discuss games, post game guides, troubleshoot issues etc) because of ""toxicity""

* They stated that game developers would be able to shut down user reviews (when they get implemented) at their discretion 

* The company (especially its executives) has a history of shitting on pc gaming and the pc gaming community, accusing pc players of being pirates and accusing them of costing epic money, and now they expect us to ignore that because they're suddenly pro pc and want our money

* This isnt really relevant anymore but the store used to have always online functionality so if you went offline you lost access to your games

* People have accidentally gotten banned from all their games

* They reportedly banned people for using a VPN

* There are allegations that they sell private user information and allegations that epic games's parent company Tencent (a major chinese corporation with ties to the ruling communist party) is supplying that same information to china"

gaming,"This is plain wrong. If you have an publisher, sure you have to negotiate with him how much money you get, but if you are an indie dev or just don't have a publisher and just publish it yourself, you can keep 88 percent when publishing instead of the 70% and 100$ fee on steam. Sure, hate on epic and love steam, but don't lie out of spite and blind corporate love."

gaming,"They literally can not possibly compete with steam if the games were on both store fronts.  If you had a choice, which one would you choose every single time?  Even if EGS improved to the point where it's actually competitive with steam?  You'd pick steam every time.  Because that's the platform you've used already for this long.  Because that's the platform you have all your friends on.  Because that's the platform you have all your games on.  They would have to put years of work into developing their storefront to still not be good enough for most people.

They do want to make their platform better, they've been working on it and it's seen a few improvements.  Keep complaining about it and it'll keep seeing improvements.  They have to do that in order to keep people for the games that aren't Epic exclusives, which is revenue they are also aiming to get.  They have to do it for the same reason steam had to do it for years despite not having competition.  But to expect the level of quality that steam has right now after well over a decade of continued development as a storefront is kinda ridiculous.  Complaining about it is fine.  Claiming that it's unusable and is a massive burden to the consumer is ridiculous.  You already likely use Origin, Uplay, Bethesda launcher, GoG Galaxy, or whatever other launchers in order to play *something* but it's Epic that is the problem.  All those other launchers that host games that aren't on steam, or are but still require you to launch the launcher anyways, you don't mind them.  There's tons of them.  But you hate Epic specifically for the reasons that you'll give the rest of them a pass on.

It's fine to complain.  Complaining is good, it gets the company to improve their product.  But the claims people are making about Epic are straight up hypocritical, irrelevant, or untrue most of the time.  I will complain about the shortcomings of the EGS, but I'll also purchase and play borderlands 3 because the storefront has nothing at all to do with my overall enjoyment of the game.  I'll purchase and play Metro Exodus because the storefront has nothing at all to do with my overall enjoyment of the game.  And your refusal to use the Epic storefront also has nothing at all to do with my enjoyment of these games.  So keep circlejerking away, I'll enjoy my games on a functional storefront that does enough, but still could use more despite that not providing much, if anything, to my gaming experience.  It functions, and that's enough for me, because it's been enough for me with other launchers that I've had to download to play some other games too.  I didn't riot then and I'm not going to riot now."

gaming,"While I agree that the price isn't even that bad, and it will definitely go down - it's still isn't worth buying at this point for someone that could afford it imo, it would be a much better idea to wait for not only that price drop, but the incredible improvement that can be made in that time, as well as the fact that almost all games won't even support something like that at this point in time, and probably won't until it is widespread technology that people are buying and making it worthwhile to implement into the game."

gaming,"That’s how you go insane.  Literally.  The people that just stayed inside the walls of the town of beginnings could not afford the food sold(not that it was any good, just filling enough to keep the mental hunger pains you suffer while playing from overwhelming you), and had to wait for special events that would have the trees in the town drop fruit for a limited time.  

They also could not pay for inn rooms, which meant that if they sleep in the streets, they ran the risk of someone manipulating their hand to open the menu and accept a duel to the death...which they would be defenseless since they are still asleep.

At the later points in the anime, manga &amp; LN, safety has been created by the larger guilds in the form of patrols...but guess what, many of these patrollers would ask for protection money as a form of taxes.  If you can’t afford the taxes, then you run the very real risk of bullying and harassment to the point that they chase you outside of town, where without equipment as you sold it all a long time ago, you will likely die.

So you can’t afford to eat, and sleeping outside isn’t safe, and the people protecting you may turnout to be little more than gangsters.  Imagine those sort of stresses on you, 24/7.  People are not built to handle that sort of mental stress, and many as you remember, committed suicide to escape it whether by jumping off the ledge or running out into the fields to die at the hands of monsters.

I’d rather take my chances at least trying out the fields to keep money in my pocket."

No cloud saves. No shopping basket. No way to detect already installed games(this one pisses me off so much). It's worse than Origin and Uplay. Let alone Steam.
Purchasing games or companies so they can force their way into competition with Steam isn't the way to do it. It's actually incredibly anti-consumer. Rather than prevent a monopoly, they just want to replace steam as the monopoly.

And if we’re talking about bending over backwards, it was the Linux community that did all of the bending to port UE4. Good on Psyonix for taking the extra half step to use the tools at their disposal and release the game on more than a single OS. That’s partially why this move is particularly frustrating; they gained a lot of respect with the multi/cross-platform releases. Epic will (not definitely but almost certainly) not bother."

gaming,"Except that Valve forced nobody to sell on their platform. They did not buy exclusivity deals, they did not take products down from other sites so you could only get it from them. They got in early on a growing market and became the leader, and have not been unseated yet because ""competition"" only comes in the form of morons who don't improve the concept at all, and instead use scummy business practices to muscle their way into the market.

gaming,"Simplistic and cherry picking. You left out the part about not letting very beloved clothing manufacturers sell their pants anywhere else if they want to sell them in your store.

Your store also has no way for customers to leave feedback, offers no refunds and lacks a lot of other features the ""big bad monopoly store"" has.

Let's also not forget that the market already isn't a monopoly because Uplay, origin, (gog) and the Bethesda launcher are a thing but those launchers didn't use scummy tactics and fortnite money to Artificial increase their value. They tried to battle steam with their own games and features, not with other games hype and a high cut for devs, subsidized by fortnite cash. (I'm looking forward to see that cut still be as low when fortnite isn't played anymore) You call steam greedy for taking 30% but at the same time steam offers a potential market of 90 million monthly users. That's 90 million people who will see your product. Without steam they'd have to do all the selling, advertising and managing of the publishing themselves.

Epic right now basically spends no money on their launcher upkeep because they have NO actual customer service other than automated emails. As soon as epic realizes how much it costs to have a customer friendly store they're gonna have increase their cut, even more when all the kids grow out of fortnite or the next big thing comes around, which is only a matter of time."
gaming,343 has lost me as a fan of the franchise. They killed what was good and fun about halo. Then the massive failure that was mcc was the last straw. I never played 5 and never will. Unless halo makes huge improvements im done with it. As of right now halo died with bungie.
gaming,"&gt;It would be nice to see Steam offer a more generous cut of the sale to the developers, at this point steam certainly doesn't need it and it would look like good will all around.
&gt;
&gt;Let's not forget that epic is intentionally not making their store a better place and that this is not competition. Its just anti consumer.
&gt;
&gt; Edit: clarifying, they are WORKING on the new features but theyre prioritizing buying the rights to game sales over making their service better. Nobody WANTS Egs because it offers LESS than steam.

Source?

You can't just shit money and instantly have a good piece of software. That's not how it works."
gaming,"Except that Steam offers a whole lot more stuff, stuff that also costs upkeep to keep going. People always talk like Steam is taking a big cut just to be assholes. Ignoring that there are plenty of things Steam does you'd normally have to pay for yourself.

Is the cut too big? Maybe. But it is not nearly to the ""Poor Developers are starving because Steam is robbing them, sniff sniff"" degree people are saying."

gaming,"He 100% looks like sanic in this pic, you guys have a Hollywood budget how the fuck did you mess this up so badly."
gaming,"Yea, except that ""$100 fee on steam"" is what allows those indie devs to even sell their game. They literally won't even be allowed on Epic Store, unless by some miracle they generate a massive hype/buzz about their indie game before it launches and Epic steps in to offer them a deal. And considering the fact that steam is 90% of the reason indie games are getting the amount of hype they are nowadays, because they actually get allowed on and even promoted on steam's front page, I don't anticipate too many indie games on Epic. So saying that money is going to the publisher is still quite accurate."
gaming,Ouch what are the chances
gaming,"You don't need to ""force"" people when you don't really give people a choice to begin with. Lets analyze an indie or even a major publisher's delema. Do they publish to some 3rd party store with maybe at best 1 million active users on a good day? Or do they publish to the storefront that just recently went past 1 billion registered users with 18 million congruent users daily. Again you don't really need to ""force"" people to publish there when it's the only real choice.  
  
They did indeed buy up developers by the way, where do you think Counter Strike came from? Convenient how we gloss over that little tidbit.  
  
They weren't early at all by the way. Direct to drive launched two years prior and Valve basically copied them and threw more money into it. They basically pulled an Apple and stole the iPhone name and just threw money at the problem.  
  
Funny how you whine about not improving the concept when Valve by the way refused to implement basic quality of life improvements that other publisher launchers had until they were forced to by governments or user pressures.  
  
I don't need to kiss his ass by the way because unlike you I care more about whether or not a game is good, not where it's bought from, because I'm not an entitled little ass that apparently doesn't give a flying fuck about developers and their jobs and would rather let Valve be a defacto monopoly."

Basically its a bs reason anyways because this is a video game user interface.

Think about it.  If you're aiming straight ahead in the game, then slightly more of what you'd see on your screen is area where targets can appear.

FOV sounds like a BS excuse.  If all you do is move where the crosshairs appears, then FOV will still make you vomit.

But yeah, basically some people prefer it one way because feelings, but there are  gameplay reasons in this specific game based on its mechanics and level design where having it slightly lower makes sense.

Why would you bother if your competition is barely functioning and doesn't even have a freaking shopping cart (among a host of other things)? If competition is supposed to fuel innovation then Epic isn't competing. Heck, they have more than a decade of experience and a list of what not to do already given to them by Valve, but they still half-assed it. 

What they're doing is strongarming people into joining them because they have Fortnite money. If the Epic Store bears fruit, then all well and good (for the executives, and if they get there). If not, Fortnite money!

Steam already had (have, even) its fair share of issues. It learned from some of them. Remember the hubbub over HL2? People got over that. The fact is, Epic with their Fortnite money SHOULD have been able to come up with a better service, but they didn't."

I've been playing Forntie for a good while now  primarily due to crossplay allowing me to play with all my friends going to University/working etc regardless of platform.

It quite literally forced people to download Steam in order to play any Valve game starting with HL2. They signed exclusivity deals to get more users onto Steam back then and allowed the publisher the ""privilege"" to sell Steam keys on other stores. They literally forced everybody onto Steam to play Counter Strike when they released the source version. Oh and lets not forget that back then if their servers were turned off, you couldn't play ANYTHING not even your new single player game Half Life 2 because Valve decided they want to make even more money and screw if it inconveniences the consumer. At least Epic lets the games go to other storefronts eventually. Metro Exodus and Borderlands 3 are on the Humble store FFS. Good luck finding anything by Valve anywhere else relevant since they haven't released anything outside of Steam for 8 years until their shitty card game came out.

I as a Compulsive buyer of Valve, still preferring Steam because is cheaper for me, and it adapts the prices to my country's coin, thing that Epic doesn't do. Also, Steam has more things like cloud save, workshop, comunnity support, the option to pay in effective, etc.
And yes, Epic gives more money to the devs, but a lot of people prefer to buy on Steam. Less sales are less money, so it's the same...
Steam its not even trying to compete because they know that they doesn't need to, they know that the community is supporting them because Epic plays dirty buying exclusives.

I mean steam has the best sales on PC (excluding Humble bundle) and overall it has a loy of good services, communities and all, its a great platform and everyone admits that.

But to be honest, that doesn't justify why they stopped making games, or why is the percentage so high, or why Steam updates are kind of slow for such a huge company, or why they don't bother to have exclusives or anything, Epic are very controversial right now, a lot of people love them and understand them, and a LOT hate them, i personally have no problems with them since its still on PC."

Look, I'm with you that OF COURSE we should support people that make things we like. That's the whole deal. I like THING, I pay the guy that made THING money so he can keep working and living.

The problem is that people argue from the standpoint that creators going over to the EGS is a valid business decision, and that they are free to do so etc. etc. But then I as the consumer am literally Satan for making a decision of my own to not want to buy there. Not is it not just ""a few clicks"". I lose Reviews, I lose discussion forums. I use a lot of other features steam has that the EGS does not. I have friends who had issues with payment, sketchy transactions and then more issues contacting support.

I'm not trying to attack you btw. You are coming from the right place, as far as I'm concerned. But I really don't think that EGS is the horse to bet on here.

gaming,"The main point your example is missing is that you'd offer that price cut and sign on bonus if they agreed to ONLY sell at your store, which limits consumers' options ultimately.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally I think Epic could potentially redeem themselves if they changed just a few of their current practices (albeit their main practice at the moment). I agree that Epic offering a lower price cut to publishers / studios is a good thing. Like you said, more revenue for developers should improve future games and updates and I'm all for supporting devs that make games I enjoy. However, Epic is truly neither pro consumer nor pro developer with their practice of buying exclusivity, even though they claim to be competing against Steam's ""monopoly"". 

&amp;#x200B;

If they wanted to legitimately compete they could keep offering a lower price cut to publishers but not buy them out to be Epic exclusive. This would be an incentive for publishers to put their games out on multiple launchers, which would be better for them because they'd get revenue from Steam along with Epic and any other launcher they decide on using, and consumers would have the choice on which platform to buy and play their games which is a win-win for everyone. The main problem with this approach though is Epic knows their launcher can't hold a candle to Steam or any of the other major game launchers at the moment, so if given the choice almost no one would choose to use Epic launcher so they force people to use it by buying exclusivity rights.  If they wanted to be true to their word and actually provide healthy competition while being pro consumer and pro developer they should focus first on improving their launcher in my opinion (reviews, friends list, chat, etc.). Once it's up to par with the rest of the competition they can encourage gamers to flock to their marketplace with sales and deals and hopefully by actually improving their service, like actual capitalism should function. This is an unrealistic example, but Epic could offer a 10% sale on the launch day for a big game while Steam has the game listed at full price (technically they cost the same on both launchers to get around Steam's price difference stipulation, but Epic just has a sale going on). For me, I would probably buy the discounted game from Epic rather than Steam in this case, given the hypothetical that their launcher is brought up to today's standards. 

(I know the whole Tencent owning a big share of Epic and the launcher potentially containing spyware is another big point of contention in this whole ordeal, but I don't know enough about any of that to have a meaningful discussion, so I chose to just mention better (in my opinion) competition practices that would hopefully benefit everyone.)"

Think about what your smart phone currently does, then think of how you'll use the same apps/games on a pair of AR glasses.

How long do you think these AR glasses will remain powered on compared to our current smart phones?

GPS, camera, etc. all the technology in our phone needing to fit onto some AR glasses in order for them to ""take over from our phones.""

AR glasses battery running low, what are your options to keep them charged while still using them?

Some people already wear corrective lenses and thus having a smart phone doesn't affect their ability to see clearly. Would these AR glasses be able to accommodate a large percentage of the population who need glasses during their day-to-day life?

Another redditor mentioned the Vuzix Blade AR glasses, but even the videos they've got of it in action are done in specific, controlled scenarios. They require the use of a small area on the side of the glasses to act as the touch pad, limiting their use. In today's social media-obsessed culture, there'd be no reliable way to take a selfie. How about zooming in/out or even typing messages (e.g. texts or emails or posting on reddit)?

and indie games using steamworks won't migrate to Epic store, so speaking about steamworks is pointless

steam right now is exactly like Apple, they are very greedy, they take percentage way bigger than what they really need (because they already makes ton of money)

Epic even said that if steam was dropping its toxic 30% cut to something more reasonable they would stop the exclusivity deals

so no, what Epic is doing is not toxic at all

Epic Store is free so it doesn't cost more to the user and it doesn't prevent the users to get the games, the only thing is some stupid morons don't want to buy from Epic store, but you know what, nobody cares about them

gaming,"Well, fair enough then. That does happen.

Like I said, it seems like they're working on things. While I'm not hopeful, there is part of me who sees that everybody is complaining about a lack of features, and them buying content.

The question that comes to my mind is this: would you use a new and unfamiliar launcher, if it had the same or better features than steam?

Maybe, maybe not. But they plan to have the same(ish) feature lineup within the coming year. What good will that do if they have no content?

They need games and developers or else everything they do is for nothing. They have fortnite money, so they can make that happen. They need to kinda balance acquiring new talent with these features.

Many people won't join without the features, many won't join without the content, developers won't rush to get in without a good infrastructure ($ometimes). So as they build, they buy. I get that business model.

Yes it may be a DLC nightmare, but to me it's like over a few hours period everyone who is upset that Epic bought Psyonix has already forgotten what Psyonix did with the eSports shop. You wanna talk DLC?

They developed and released a shit ton of DLC ($11 for a wheel set in Canada, outrageous), while they put out a recent bug fix on Tuesday that seemed to address essentially 0 issues, while bringing new ones to the table. Don't quote me on 0, it's facetious, but you know what I mean.

Psyonix built Rocket League on the Unreal engine, Epic and them have been   in partnership for years. They worked on lots of stuff together, it's easily Googled.

Psyonix in the last year has completed a tournament mode which goes (I'm speculating) 90% untouched on minimum. They've released this new e sports shop. They've tried a battlepass (read: rocketpass) system and they haven't gotten challenges working properly. They have an enormous issue when it comes to version control and glitches that just won't die with updates.

Psyonix has dropped the ball a few times this year and I think they really needed a refresh. Trust me, this is coming from a huge fan.

As a community leader in Rocket League Trading, I actually kinda hope Epic can fix some of this issues because Epic has money to throw at them. I don't know what's going to happen with the trading market or with DLC or in game transactions (I assume they will increase), but a conscious gamer can resist DLC if they think it's not important.

If Psyonix didn't make a change the game was going to die, soon.

I hope this was the right change."
gaming,"&gt;At this point, how many sales are they looking at?

I love how people like always argue from the ""WELL I CARE ABOUT CREATORS"" high horse. So they are free to make business decisions as they please, but we as consumers are morally obligated to follow whatever they do?

I would be happy to have competition for Steam. It would maybe finally speed up their incredibly slow pace when it comes to quality of life improvements. Fact remains EGS is not competition. It's a petulant rich kid buying his way into a clubhouse. 

A few months down the line, when more and more money goes down the drain for exclusives, maybe EPIC realizes that they could maybe implement a feature or two into their garbage pile of a store, that manages to somehow be worse than both Uplay and Origin. The former was a buggy mess that occasionally took your money without adding games properly, and the latter was literal spyware until somebody read the TOS and called them out.

But hey, if you want to keep supporting the policy of ""We're doing nothing of worth for you, but please do keep giving us all your money"" go right ahead, bud."
gaming,Steam IS pc gaming. Trust me Ive i stalled my fair share of flopies/CDs/DVDs with serial codes.
gaming,Ask somewhere else. BO Forums may give you a good answer
gaming,The real question is does it need to update windows?
gaming,They will not (in short term) pull it from Steam.
gaming,"It's okay, people just don't agree. Nothing wromg with that everyone is entitled to their own opinions"
gaming,This is my first time seeing it but I'm heavily interested. It seems really precise. Idk about normal gameplay but I've seen a ton of videos being posted about it in this sub so it must be something fun. It was literally a game I had never seen and suddenly people are posting about it left and right so maybe that speaks for some kind of volume.

gaming,I mean you can still play them even if you're boycotting *purchasing* them.
gaming,All those were DoA because they didn't work. I'm not pretending Steam is some saint that is forgiven for everything because Epic exists now. You seem to have a hatred for Steam and you do you. I'm not one to tell people where to spend their hard earned money. I just know better than to trust a company just because they tell you one thing that sounds good. Support the devs? That's bullshit since a large portion of the game industry works under contracts and the extra money goes to the publishers.
gaming,"Was solid till GFWL took a shit and died, honestly."
gaming,You guys need to stop being so aggressive towards Epic. Market competition is something good and will aspire Steam to be better.
gaming,*Have you ever toasted bread but it came out too hot? Then it burns your fingers and you can't enjoy playing your games because your fingers are on fire? Well say hello to the Razer Toaster!

I hope the whole company bombs itself until they have to close off so I don't have to read a new article or post about ""Hey, EGS is still garbage, more News at 11."" and more importantly, so I don't have to wait a whole year for stuff like Borderlands 3. I will though, as long as those hacks at EPIC don't get any of my money."

I hope it helps you see the world more gray and less black and white"
gaming,"Exactly. I don't get it how people can't understand this. Without those there would literally be 0 chances for Epic Store to have a shot against Steam, even if their store would have 100 features more.

About the prices, I already know people that chose Steam against GOG or others, even if they had a bigger price than them."

gaming,"You can sometimes catch it on sale for $20 including all the DLC , the DLC is completely worth it imo."
gaming,I’ve seen this pic before could someone show me if it’s true or not?
gaming,"I'm sure the price will come down. But the point is, currently it's not cheap enough to be economically viable for Mass production. And I promise you it'll never be required for VR games given its limited usefulness, so I doubt it'll ever really be viable given the material cost alone."
gaming,"I did right now, thank you for pointing out. Its the perfect sub for this"
gaming,"Not by default, but you can add the original soundtrack easily."
gaming,"&gt;loads of bribe money

I wouldn't call it bribe money, the money they are giving out was in the form of guaranteed sales, so if the game didn't reach sales expectations then epic would pay the difference. This essentially removes the risk Devs/publishers would face when launching on an unproven platform.

And I would say that they are more Dev friendly than publisher friendly (though what's good for Devs is often good for publishers). Such as when they changed the revenue split on their unreal engine marketplace from 30% to 12%, and they back payed everyone as if it had been 12% the entire time, which is something I don't think any other platform would be willing to do."

gaming,"I had no choice, it broke and was forever floppy."
gaming,What about the sword art online setup?
gaming,"Sure, you will probably be able to keep playing the game on Steam. But you will not be able to purchase any future DLC without going through the Epic store, since Steam's terms of service prohibits selling DLC for games that aren't available through their store."
gaming,I guess they missed getting your approval before the acquisition
gaming,Might need to rethink your cooling set up
gaming,"1. GOG exists and is appreciated, unlike Epic. So your alleged ""Valve worship"" is BS.
2. GOG also said their current margin is as low as they can realistically go, so your alleged ""arrogance"" is also BS.
3. Epic's deals aren't ""fair"", they're unsustainable loss-leaders using Fortnite's profits in order to strike against Valve. Even their CEO admitted as much."

gaming,"I can easily live with that, whats 500$ in comparisson to a new skate game..."
gaming,"&gt; Have fun.

Or lack thereof! lol"
gaming,I like the headphone jacks
gaming,"&gt; There is nothing Valve could possibly do to stop Epic or any other company from spending millions on exclusives and buying devs.

Oh, but there is. Decrease their percentage so the companies wouldn't have such a huge advantage on Epic about that. They could probably do exclusives, too. But they won't do none of that until their sales will not drop massively (like 40%)."
gaming,ME HATE EPIC ME HATE FORTNITE THIS BAD
gaming,What is a chaos ball? Are they similar to the chaos emeralds from the first games?
gaming,"50,000 people used to play this, but now it's a ghost town"

gaming,"Runs buttery smooth, but at toasty temperatures."
gaming,True. I tried to find a server but there was nothing
gaming,"Do you honestly have any hopes that they'll get it right?

It's not gonna be a game for FF fans. It's gonna be a game for the new generation, inspired by FF7. I'm sure ""true"" FF7 fans will most likely dislike it."
gaming,FuzzyPuzzles is an existing purchaser. So what context are you talking about?
gaming,Damn I get it lol
gaming,X Toast One X
gaming,"What the hell are you talking about? Direct2Drive is STILL around. Windows Store relaunched and is doing well. Drengin evolved into two more iterations with it's success until it was sold to GameStop. They quite literally didn't go DOA on everybody. They however didn't ramrod people into only downloading their launchers like Valve did.  
  
No I don't hate Valve, what I hate is their complacency. For years they had literally no real competition and it shows because now they let any garbage onto steam to let them net more money instead of enforcing a standard. They just sat on their outdated revenue model that fucked over indie devs until they were forced to and even then the new model only helps big publishers.  
  
Support the devs is bullshit? Alright well I guess we'll just ignore the legions of indie devs out there that jumped ship from Steam because it's such a garbage dump they needed to go to Epic or the Switch to make any money. Yep all indies are just contractors and the money really goes to the big publisher fat cats.  
  
Jesus christ can you be anymore of a Valve bootlicker?"
gaming,Sony being doing this on consoles for years to be honest
gaming,The Epic Games Launcher doesn't have always online DRM.
gaming,"It's almost like that epic is something that affects quite a lot of gamers on pc, and how it turns out in the end might completely change how the industry looks. \*gasp\*

&amp;#x200B;

I get that it might be annoying if you don't care as much yourself, or if you get tired of the posts. But Reddit is practically made to be just this: An assortment of separated echo chambers, each convinced it is better and smarter than the others. Just scroll past it, it will go away. Might take a while though in this case."
gaming,"Worked for Origin, Battle.net and Steam"
gaming,The master chief collection was hands down the most disappointing and upsetting release I have ever seen in my 20 years of gaming on this earth. I felt genuinely betrayed and assaulted the day it came out and I couldn’t even go online
gaming,"The reason why they don't like Epic is because they are not ALLOWING competition. If you looked at this problem past the surface you would see that with Rocket League for instance, they did not say, ""Come use our service if you'd like,"" they bought their parent company outright and are forcing them to sell only through the Epic store.

They are trying to compete with Valve in the ways that the console plebians have to deal with competition, and that is marketed exclusives and limited licenses. One of the giant plus points of using a PC was that companies could not lock their games behind an exclusive service because everything uses the same executable to run. Now with the Epic Launcher forcing bootstraps, any PC gamer who wants to play Borderlands or Rocket League or (it looks more like it every day) RDR2 is going to be forced to download a program that just got its Offline Mode two damn months ago and is known for process logging and losing credit card information. And if they don't, they won't get to play.

Epic is doing what Steam never did and forcing players to choose. Now studios will be forced to make games for the company instead of the player and we will be stuck with the same soulless, low quality nonsense that weighs down the consoles. Trying to defend it as saying ""buh-buht Steam did this and that"" is bullshit too because we had zero problems with companies selling themselves to Valve or forcing players to use the Steam Launcher. Players got to decide what got made. Players got to decide where to play. How to play. Who to play with. And Epic is trying to take that away. You can take that dumb rhetoric with you, way the hell away from my PC market."
gaming,Think they should've put the effort they put into Spiderman into this.
gaming,Are you deliberately trying to not understand my point? Are you deliberately only replying about Rocket League and not my other arguments?
gaming,It’s the eyes. Just fix the eyes please
gaming,"Idk man, the cooling looks pretty bad, hope your cpu doesn't get toasted!"
gaming,"I'm not calling you satan for not buying from EGS at all. You should have the freedom to do business with whoever you do or do not want to. But so should the developers, and that is not a meme. It's a right that we should all respect. You can still get reviews and discussion forums, just not on EGS... (yet)

I take reviews to the bank in a lot of cases, so to say they least, they're meaningful to me. But they don't only exist on steam. And in some cases I don't need a review. Specifically in the case of BL3 and Rocket league. Fuck a review, I'm gonna support those two games no matter where they sell it and no matter what any player has to say about it. That's just me. 

I respect your opinion and it seems like you respect mine. I just think we should all respect the Dev's decisions.  ""EPIC BAD"" is a meme and it's all over this thread. But Epic isn't forcing these games to go exclusive, they're making an offer that the dev teams *want* to take. 

If Epic goes as far as ""any unreal engine game must be EGS exclusive"" then I'll join in on the outrage. But I can't hate on them for giving people a more appealing option. And I can't hate on developers for taking them up on it. 

We should all be mad at Vavle for leaving it to the community to be angry and boycott and yadayada instead of making deals that entice developers and making them *want* to come back to steam."

gaming,"I did not play the games and i don't really care about sonic, so, to me this looks nice. I don't understand all this rage.

Edit: I just wanted to add that i know i'll get downvoted to pieces but keep in mind that the world does not limit itself to reddit or 9 gag or any other community like this. Most people probably like how this looks and will most likely go see it."
gaming,Im a owner of that game the original
gaming,"Not really. You can still play the game, nothing changes. It can even change for the better, like going free and gaining more popularity and playerbase. Plus they will have more money to invest in the game and in future games."
gaming,"I'd notice a ball weight change in rocket league waaaaay more than a football weight change, for example."
gaming,"Basically, Epic is more friendly for developers and Steam is more friendly when it comes to customers. I'd say this can only lead to good competition. Epic is going to keep evolving to be more competitive which means Steam has to put more effort into making the situation better for everyone.

Breaking Steam's monopoly is a good thing."

gaming,"Unreal Engine is Epic's biggest money maker at 5% of all Unreal Engine game sales. Like you said, it's one of the biggest game engines. Boycotting it is more impactful to Epic than boycotting their launcher or games."

But they still kept going"

gaming,Exactly what you think
gaming,"I don't remember any game destroyed by Epic. Yes, they stopped development on some that were not released, but beyond that they have great games and their engine is probably the best from the market (and there are a lot of games made with it in the last 20+ years, including Rocket League)."
gaming,"&gt; A good number of the steam features have been planned for egs

Egs is out since 2018 and it doesnt even have shopping cart which is a quite basic feature"

gaming,"Well, time to uninstall.

gaming,Very true. It's a peripheral for a peripheral for a PC. The market here is slim to begin with.
gaming,"Exactly, Sony being doing this for years no one cares, u can still play in Pc! So what's the big deal?! Do everyone realise that they don't new to buy a new console its still Pc crybaby generation, the true milk generation."
gaming,"The problem is, you are arguing for an environment that we already have on consoles. Customers are not given choice, the market is developing into a direction where it's not about ""What do we offer you if you buy here?"" But instead ""You can only ever get ""Series"" here, so you HAVE to buy with us!""

&amp;#x200B;

The fundamental problem here is that many people argue like the only relevant participant in the business transaction here are Developers and/or Publishers. EPIC is supposed to get a pass because they offer them attractive deals, and it is fine to take them. But as a consumer the field right now is this:

I was excited for Borderlands 3. It goes to EGS. Maybe the guys that make or publish B3 get more money. But what do I get? Nothing, except having to use a storefront I don't want to use, that has none of the features I've come to appreciate, that has made it abundantly clear that it does not care about the experience I have, it only cares about the creator side of things. To me, this is all downsides. So I react with indignation, and my response is to not buy into it.

If Steams tarted to respond in kind, storefront would stop developing entirely. We would not get new features, quality of life improvements. Heck, they'd probably barely update them at all. After all, you have exclusivity, and consumers have no choice but to buy here or skip out of a game they like.

I don't want that kind of environment. It's bad enough on consoles, I don't want it here too."
gaming,...yeah? Why let steam get a portion of the profits from a game you own
gaming,After reading this I know *even less than when I started*
gaming,good for u!! \^\^
gaming,"I don’t disagree. All joking aside, if I could go back to talk to myself at age 15 or around there one of the first things I’d tell myself is “Do not care so much what other people/kids think of you.” Deep down they’re all scared, insecure shit stains. Older people (myself, 39) give advice like it’s easy but most of us didn’t walk around not giving a shit. Hang in there. They’re being pricks but they just don’t know any better."

So I personally think that pushback to stuff like this is healthy."

gaming,"Only familiar with PC sorry.   

Starcraft 2 is free to play the multiplayer and entire first campaign, definitely worth a look. I'd call it the best pure RTS game. If you're in to old games then check out Dungeon Keeper Gold and Earth2150, available on GOG among other places. Warcraft 3 is an RTS with some RPG elements in the heroes, excellent long campaign, though also somewhat old now. The Civilization and Total War series are both excellent strategy series. XCOM is a great tactical strategy game series.    

The strategy genre is wide and incredibly varied, don't be put off if you try one style and don't like it, still give another sub-genre a try. Maybe try dipping your toes in on a game and then come back here with what you liked/disliked to get more recommendations."
gaming,I am just thinking what it would be like in vr...
gaming,"It lost relevance because you bought two games on store that are highly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things?

As a single platform, steam is by far the most relevant. There is a bit more exclusives outside of steam these days but they are all over the place and only used for a single popular game or two, at most. Which is not a problem for steam : it is impossible for any gamer to be contempt with MS Store only or Uplay only.

I think the latest scandal showed how much better and relevant steam is and will be for a while."

gaming,"I'd like to add to it - even if it's not 100% true (fact check me) - but they basically took support from other titles they had and cause some to even shut down (Paragon) just to fund the abysmal Fortnite. People enjoyed their other properties (and even the original PvE mode for Fortnite), so for them to follow the money so greedily pisses me off."

gaming,"I couldn't agree more, I rarely open steam anymore and when I do it's usually just to play NBA2k19. Recently I've been playing Division 2 and Sea of Thieves. I think steam is going to need to accept the fact that in order to stay on top they are going to need to cut their profit percentage so that it is more fair to the devs."

gaming,"&gt; monopoly

the exclusive possession or control of the supply of or trade in a commodity or service

Just because Steam is a market leader that is a popular choice, doesn't just magically become some boogeyman monopoly just because you feel like it.

Steam *earned* what they have, and they just as easily stand to lose it as well. Other publishers and services are free to try things their way, and see if they can build their own consumer base. All those other competitors (and consoles) out there are giving Steam more real competition than Epic is. Usain Bolt doesn't have a monopoly on running fast just because he's a tough guy to beat in a race.

I call Epic cheaters because they are clearly focused on just throwing cash around to buy their way in and lock out titles, instead of delivering a quality product that naturally builds its own market position. I'm sure that'll impress some management types who want those juicy profit margins, but it'll be a cold day in hell before either the low-tier developers or consumers see any of that ""trickle down"" bullshit. Steam is just a storefront. Popular, but in the end just a store. One of many. Epic is offering a worse experience, and is more focused on appealing to businesses than appealing to their actual consumers. Obviously that's why people have a sour opinion of them.

What I don't understand is this frothing defense that pops up for what is clearly a lackluster consumer experience for all this mythology of ""giving Steam some REAL competition"", as if Epic is some David vs Goliath trying to battle the giant for the sake of us lowly plebs."

gaming,"steam never forced exclusive deals though, and it build from valves own games then rest jumped in (and with 3rd party ones, indie tends launch in gog and steam simultaneously), with origin I dont mind because it only contains company's own games; but with epic I care lot because its forcing 3rd party devs in"
gaming,In Farnborough in the UK we have a similar thing called overworld in one of the shopping centres. Long strips of tables with consoles and I’m guessing some PCs as well.

gaming,"Replicating reality is rarely what a FPS sets out to do.

Aside from that, you're still off about FOV.  After all, if you increase it, the ratios remain the same.  With a centered crosshairs, you're just seeing even MORE of the useless floor in front of your feet in proportion to the addition space up top - in a way that's ""vomit inducing"" and distorts the image.

It'd be ideal to not have to distort the image and still have the most relevant viewpoint to spot possible enemies.

But I understand you have a personal preference for your viewing angle in a game you have never played on PC lol"

gaming,"Psyonix has done nothing wrong here, they are free to choose where to sell their game and as of now they haven't taken down their Steam store page or said they ever will. Even if they did take down the main game from the store page as long as all future content stays available none of this should be a problem for the community since crossplatform already exists. 

It is true that Epic still has a long way to go with their store, to even come close to the features that Steam offers and that buying up exclusives isn't a good way to compete or at least doesn't favor the customer in any way. Epic does however still look clean with while few, mostly high quality games and few early access where Steam lately just went with a whatever anything goes approach, allowing for asset flips, rpgmaker games, hentai and other low effort titles to take front page time from devs that genuinely try to sell a good game, making it easy to fall into obscurity.

Maybe Epic is the bad guy in this story but make sure you don't mistake Valve with the Steam store as the good guy."
gaming,Not in thr long run if they loose their customers
gaming,Would be better if you added Razor Nuttela.
gaming,"NAT means Network Address Translation, which most routers that are setup as home gateways have. Meaning that her public connection is going through 2 NAT routers.

3 possible cases:

1. Her home network setup includes one router,
2. Her home network setup includes more than one router,
3. Her ISP has her public connection going through two NAT routers.

You can solve case 1 alone, by enabling upnp or manually port forwarding the app port to her device in the router's settings.

You can solve case 2 alone also, by enabling dmz in the first router's settings for the second router's lan ip, combined with upnp or manual port forwarding on the second router.

You can't solve case 3 alone. You would need to call the ISP and ask them to move you away from NAT so you have a normal own public ip.

Those are all pure guesses, by not knowing the exact network setup it is hard to find the right solution. I would start by comparing the public ip with the one reported in the modem info web page with the one found on one of the public ip lookup websites. If they match, then there is no case 3.

Other than that, voice messaging apps like WhatsApp or Discord do work even with double NAT as the requests get forwarded through both NAT routers since those apps use a range of random ports to prevent conflict."

Except you won't, because it'll make you have one less reason to blindly hate something as stupid as a game launcher when it's popular to hate it.  You just gotta be part of the crowd though, you just have to fit in and be cool like all the other people that circle jerk here.  If you want to hold up this point as if it's some kind of crown jewel of the bunch, you're going to have to hold it up over all the other launchers as well.  Origin has done this exact thing.  Blizzard launcher has done this exact thing.  Steam has done this exact thing.  Every single game launcher has done this, but since EGS is hated right now, it's being treated like it's some kind of trump card.  You're acting like something that's actually really common and explainable is unacceptable, but *only for this one particular company because they're in the negative spotlight*.

This is epic trying to play it's way into the market and compete with steam. But this isn't good for consumers simply because consumers do not benefit from it. You now have less options for sellers, sellers who are also no longer competing for your sale simply because they can't due exclusivity. This is only good for publishers and developers."

gaming,"I think they should try to build their success by their own merits, not by taking it from others. You know, like buying exclusive rights after it's already been announced on a platform (read: Anno) isn't a tactic that will give you a good reputation. The same goes for buying exclusive rights for only 6 months (read: Borderlands) so you clearly only want the initial hype numbers and don't care about it afterwards.

On their own these actions might be questionable but not necessarily bad. Combined, they create a pattern.

Competition should be about getting better by improving yourself, not pushing others down."

gaming,"The review system is real killer for me, and the main reason why I won’t be buying an exclusive from epic anytime soon. The launcher was designed solely for the gain of the corporations, and to put it bluntly, with the user in the back of the bus.

Steam has already fixed review bombing. They don’t want reviews on their Store to incentivize publishers to choose Epic exclusivity so that their game sales aren’t harmed by negative reviews. When bad or good games release, Steam reviews actually work to help people make their decisions."

gaming,"But that isn't true about the console wars. Both platforms get tons of updates all the time and 99% of games aren't exclusive. The console war is a joke, but as PC players we still at least get all the games.

 Yeah there are major downsides for us, but the pluses for the devs turn into more updates to the games themselves and more installations in those series. So we pay the same price for more/better products but have to deal with a crappy store for *some* of them. 

The quality of the storefront mostly matters while your debating if you want the game. We can refer to YouTube and twitch to decide that, and after we own in we can import it to our steam library and ignore EGS. 

I don't know. I guess it just doesn't seem so bad to me. Maybe because I already like to watch a decent amount of gameplay before buying any game (unless it's a story game). So I already go to twitch and YouTube to decide on that, and the user reviews on steam are a bonus to me not the deciding factor."

gaming,"&gt;It’s a bribe

One that gives Devs the exact amount of money they predicted they would get. If the game sells twice as well as predicted epic gives them nothing. The benefit of going exclusive is the fact that they get 25% more per sale than if they were on steam, with epic guarenteeing sales there is no risk."

It is a good thing and a bad thing though. Good because Steam will actually step up their shit and might do something after years of dormancy, and bad because I was REALLY looking forward to Metro Exodus and Borderlands 3, but hey I’m a patient dude."

gaming,When we first heard that reddit was considering taking the money from Tencent there was a lot of discussions going on. Now its not relevant anymore so people wont talk about it. The same will happen to epic ganes store because either they actually make it good and somehow restore the reputation or they just let it die.
gaming,"With like...3 shootings that I'm aware of in the past 5 or so days, I guess so. That doesn't mean it has to be any less impactful. Something becoming the norm doesn't necessarily mean it should be normalized. Something like shootings becoming the norm should be a massive wakeup call, but this is hardly the discussion to have in r/gaming. Again, I was just trying to provide context to the dude's confusion over the downvotes. It's still a pretty fresh wound and I wouldn't blame him if he was legitimately unaware a school shooting just happened."

gaming,"Social club makes use of steam as does uplay, I have the same complaints about origin, stop making people download more launchers to play games, it's one thing if the stores will play nice it's another when stores are actively limiting the platforms you can play games on, now this is not to say they can't have original IP like fortnight for epic or left 4 dead on steam it's another to actively look to hold third party games off another platform. It's bad for the consumer just like loot boxes are but just like this people defended loot boxes and now they are the norm if people don't speak up when dissatisfied and speak with there wallets company's will not change and things will get worse and worse for consumers 

If we don't speak out we are no better then frogs sitting in a pot of water slowly boiling to death

Edit: a few words to make a sentence make more sense"
gaming,Yea but they won’t. People will still play Rocket League like nothing happened.
gaming,"&gt;Boneworks is both the name of the game and the engine

No, the Engine is Unity, the tech demo of an app they have is codenamed Boneworks. They planned to have a pre-made Unity engine to sell, but decide to make a full game instead. Devs are Stress Level Zero, same guys that made hover junkers and Duck Season. They have a youtube channel they appear in called, Node."

gaming,"Well, I have Metro Exodus on Epic. I don't see why you would boycott it. You just download it and never have to open the launcher again. Since it's DRM-free (iirc) you can just delete the launcher after installing it.

But the good thing you mentioned is why I don't have a problem with Epic, they're aggresive competition that's forcing Steam to become better, at least for developers, who in my opinion have been shit on far too much in recent years.

Btw, I personally didn't like Exodus all that much."

The only reason why they wont remove it from syeam (ONLY for users that ALREADY own it) its because they can literally be sued for removing the means to play a game you paid, forcing you into anothe software not part of the buy and service agreement. Even if it is, consume laws often conflict with those so unlilely they would get away doing thay. Perhaps not in the US but yes in other countries."

gaming,"The exclusivity part is completely at arbitrary , and so is the money guarantee. The only reason the guarantee is there is because of the exclusivity, and the money is there to back it up, it’s bribery. I’d  imagine that guarantee isn’t given to every single indie game on store.

Wouldn’t the smartest business decision be to release them on both platforms? No, because that wouldn’t work for Epic, and the publisher wouldn’t get that sweet sweet Epic games Fortnite money. Epic games is paying for the game in the place of the customer, and where does that leave the customer? Force fed a dose of Epic games launcher, the publisher doesn’t give a shit they’re guaranteed the fat stacks of money."

gaming,"Fair play to em, they pioneered one of the few microtransaction systems that actually isn't anti consumer and made a brilliant game.

So basically it goes through files on your hard drive. Also there isn’t any email verification as far as I know.

They’re saying that they want to be a competition of steam which should be beneficial to gamers but by forcing them to use their launcher via exclusivity is just awful and I won’t ever support it."

Let them have their reasons, and let them want their games on Steam. If epic owned 4A games, I wouldn’t give a shit, but they don’t own them. For me, I own every OG and redux version of the Metro games on steam, and by god I’m going to get Exodus alongside them in my library as well. 

Yea Valve has been a shit company, but Steam has been improving incredibly over the years, since 2011 when I first got into PC gaming.  Refunds, big picture, community improvements, in-client mod support for certain games, native controller support, SALES, a good recommendation system, and most importantly an elegant UI that just works. Steam IS PC gaming for most people.

Also the Metro games are slow, and often reward stealth over direct combat. They aren’t for everyone, but I recommend you give it a try again and focus on soaking in the bleak atmosphere and get lost in the world. At least that’s how Metro 1 and 2 are, I’ll be waiting patiently for Exodus here."

gaming,"&gt;Epic sucks and if it weren't for exclusives, there'd be zero incentive to use it

So much this. I want the epic store not to suck. I can live with several launchers, especially if it drives up developer revenue (I've always considered steams 30% cut to be excessivly greedy).

gaming,"BMI is there, it's still very simple, like a 1 or 0 kind of thing. But your friend is right, hooking your mind up to the matrix is so far off, it's doubtful earthlings will live to see it. That kind of tech would require so many breakthroughs in brain science it's considered impossible that we will ever be able to do something like that. Our body, brain and nervous system most likely won't respond positively to something like that. You'd have to injected with needed bodily fluids and find a way to make muscles magically work themselves not to mention somehow translate digital data into brain signals that we would understand.  

Sure technology moves fast, but this kind of tech we are talking about is like trying to create a wormhole. It's just not possible for even the foreseeable centuries, let alone, seemly not possible at all.

gaming,"&gt; Console exclusives make sense at least because there's a competition to sell consoles. Yes there is competition to sell games on a digital marketplace, too but PC gamers have always had a choice of where they want to buy it for the most part.

So if the epic store made you buy a 50$ flash drive to use it your mind would accept it because they are pushing hardware?

What the fuck kind of logic is that? Sony hides their game behind consoles also using them for exclusivity. Here you need to download a FREE FUCKING LAUNCHER."

gaming,"No, they didn't bought them. They only bought a minority in them, they don't make any decision in Epic since they are minority (even if they have like 40% shares). The Epic owner (Tim Sweeney) decides everything.

They own shares in a lot of companies, including Reddit, Snapchat, Tesla, Ubisoft or Activision-Blizzard. Yes, they own companies like Riot Games. That means nothing, they want money and they are a huge investor, that's all. They didn't destroy (or anything like that) neither of these companies."

Boycott the game because you despise their business practices? Whiny pansy get over it. Fucking bootlickers would cut their own legs off for these companies that don't give a shit about them."
gaming,"&gt; I think steam is going to need to accept the fact that in order to stay on top they are going to need to cut their profit percentage so that it is more fair to the devs.

This has little to do with the % cut steam takes. Discord games only takes 10% cut on games they sell on their store (2% better than epic store) yet you don't see millions of devs begging them for exclusivity.

Epic store buys out exclusivity deals on top of the % cut. Essentially buying their way in to exclude competition. So the only way for valve to counter that is to buy out exclusivity for games themselves. Then eventually the whole PC landscape will be based of bidding wars over who pays the highest to get whatever game... I don't think that's healthy for the industry, and i think valve know this is something yhey dont want to do. Howevrr, offering unique features for the consumers and using that as a selling point... Now that is beneficial to the industry."

gaming,"&gt; and therefore **probably** DLC

that's exactly what u/EBannion warned you about. It's an assumption, it would make sense but you have no confirmation they will. In fact it might be a good strategy for them to force users to move while staying true to their word. ""Sure you can still play it with Steam if you had it at the time... but the version you have won't see any of the future major releases"".

DLCs might be money, but they're clearly not above sacrificing reputation nor revenue to force themselves into the market and ensure bigger benefits in the long run."

gaming,"How is Epic Store good for the consumer? I have only seen little to no or even worse benefit and no price reduction. I would have been ok if the games were 5-10$ cheaper, but they are the same 60$ or equivalent price as in Steam. Also the CEO Sweeney has said that the savings the companies are making when using the Epic Store would trickle down to the consumers, but it hasn't and it wont. I don't think publisher want to lower prices, they would have jack up the prices if they could, this is why we have microtransactions.

&amp;#x200B;

They have showed a road map and you can clearly see that important features like shopping cart and others are not in their immediate priority. The CEO also said that he is ok with the current store condition, meaning that with continue buying exclusives and they don't need to rush on developing the store. On the other hand it is forcing employees in other projects to work for 100h a week and with ""mandatory"" overtime with risk of loosing their jobs if they don't. Is this really a company that you would like to support?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fine with company choosing different stores to put there games there. The problem is how Epic is doing this. First it was with Metro: Exodus, puled out of Steam after having preorders there and has been heavily promoted. The CEO Sweeney said they will not going to do it again and then doing it again with Borderlands3. He continue to say it will keep buying exclusive games without regrading previous plans they may have with Steam.

&amp;#x200B;

How many launchers do you have? How many more do you want? How many more companies you want to snoop around you PC? Epic Store was doing it. You also need an account for each of them and also your credit card info, so you can have greater risk of that information leaking.

&amp;#x200B;

It really does shows that you haven't been keeping up with all the stuff Epic has done, not done or lied about it."

Like I said in my original comment, I'm all for devs getting more money. 12% more revenue (of course its less than that, given tax and such) will have tons of trickle down effects; larger budget for maintenance, expansions and sequels, less stressed timelines for the devs, more staff, better salaries.... the list goes on.

gaming,I am buying a game which I cannot access without the launcher
gaming,They've already used it.  Incidentally it was used on Borderlands 2 after everyone review bombed it when Borderlands 3 was made Epic exclusive.
gaming,He kind of had a crappy ending in westworld too. The entire Dolores storyline became a little too high-minded and pretentious for me.
gaming,Rumors are that it’s gonna launch alongside the next gen Xbox which was what Halo 4 was supposed to do. And now hearing about this budget it makes sense and it’s more likely that’s the case
gaming,"I did the same thing, found out you can pause right as you jump off the cart. First thing that came to mind was: ""wonder if I can make a save here?"" Now anytime I want to make a new character I just load up the save file titled ""Prisoner""."
gaming,"Epic games store is mallware, doesn't have nearly as much useful features as steam, and bcuz of this is using money to pull games to their store to give us a lesser gaming experience. Fuck epic games"

gaming,"&gt; and oh they have exclusives... so what’s new?

You said it right there... Exclusives.

Exclusives are new to the PC platform, and I don't want to pay some rich companies to establish them as the new norm."
gaming,He's sitting on it to keep it warm.
gaming,"But can you go outside to mars and shoot martians all while driving drunk in your moon buggy? 

I think your problem is that you have no imagination."
gaming,I was 7 years old when I did that
gaming,"Not really, Halo is a pretty trash fps compared to others"
gaming,"For now. Don't you see that when the game is removed from Steam, the population will decline rapidly because people don't like being forced to use Epic. Less population = less people playing and this continues until there are 1k people at peak times during the holidays. And the Workshop is gone, no more fan made maps, no more fan made cars, no more fan made mods."
gaming,Great. With synapse I’m going to have to reset my setting daily.
gaming,"I wish it were that easy.  So many games run on the Unreal engine that it's actually difficult not to support Epic indirectly.  Even with Fortnite, I wouldn't be surprised if Epic also gets a massive paycheck from UE royalties."
gaming,"Unless they do something stupid like stagger the release of each Halo game in the collection then it will easily be a top 3 concurrent user game on Steam. Easily. However if they stagger the release of each game in the collection, it will likely fail to keep anyone's attention. Especially if they start off with the worst game in the series: Reach."
gaming,"photo-realism in VR already exists, just need better optimization and maybe the next gen GPUs

gaming,well in that case if it's just 20$... but again without warranty.... from this 1060 I would upgrade to 1080 or higher. Anything under that wouldn't be worth it because of that perfomance and price.
gaming,"Wouldn't trust that toaster past 3 months.

gaming,0/10 not enough potatoes
gaming,Possibly Ron Guyatt? Looks like his style.
gaming,You can totally see the remblance. She has your nose for sure! This is awesome man!
gaming,"You do realize the big issues surrounding EGS vs Steam is the fact that EGS has had repeated data breaches as well as complete disregard for the consumerbase? Everyone wants competition for steam because competition insights change for the betterment of everyone, but the way that EGS is trying to run everything is both shady and unethical. I can personally count on one hand the amount of times I've felt that my account on steam was at risk in the last 10 years, with EGS I'm constantly emailed about people trying to brute force my account from all over the world. At one point someone got into my epic account and linked it to an Xbox account from the other side of the globe. There was zero attempt to confirm identity when a login so out of the norm should've been and would've been flagged by any other games platform. Tie in the linux concerns, as small as they might be, and it becomes glaringly obvious that Epic is a company that cannot be trusted to keep the consumer in mind."
gaming,Skyrim Toasted  Edition incoming
gaming,"Graphics don't matter for VR. You'd know this if you tried VR. Fucking minecraft feels real. It has to do with presence, and the first gen kits from 3 years have had that since."
gaming,"From the Steam page, Splash Damage and Ruffian Games is helping."
gaming,How long until someone tweets from this.
gaming,"The difference here is epic isnt paying for the exclusivity, they are outright buying the company.  So exclusivity is irrelevant as its their product.  Steams dev agreement states that any game offered on steam must also sell all DLC on steam so this is likely gonna be a metro:exodus situation.  It's remains available for download for current owners but after a future date, any rocket league purchases (game and dlc) will be epic  store only"
gaming,Best game setup ever know to man. 11/10
gaming,"No such thing as trickle down. They pocket that. And you can't cross your fingers hoping it does, you gotta look out for you, not them, otherwise you're just gonna get used."
gaming,"Dude, again... Sony being doing this 4 years."
gaming,"Thanks so much!
It is indeed the Razer kraken in quartz :) 

So me and my boyfriend have quite long gaming sessions. I used to get a bunch of headaches with literally every headset i tried. 

Not gonna lie, i originally bought the Quartz headset purely for the colour. But it gave me so much more than i was expecting. 

I haven’t had headaches whilst gaming since i started using it, its very comfortable on the head. The ear pieces are so squishy and comfortable. Its great if you wear glasses. 

Its quite light on your head and the cable is super good quality. 

The sound is pretty great in my opinion, it can definitely be used for sound whoring :)"
gaming,An isekai anime about a guy driving around an interdimensional taxi for various creatures sounds pretty fun.
gaming,"Nothing, *nothing*, can ever top Raul Julia.

But I'll check out the movies mentioned in this thread anyways; see if they're worth second-best ;)"

gaming,If only it had been a real gun. Then we would’ve been spared all this.
gaming,"The Index is the best VR kit available. Hell, even the vive pro is $1300 and the Index beats it in every category. The Index is cheap, yo. Stop being a stingy pesant and go get a VR kit."
gaming,u can play i am bread on that
gaming,"Hey, I kinda need your help me and my friends have bought dying light but it fails every time we inv each other. Do you know how to connect to multiplayer?"
gaming,In the future wars between nations will be more frequent than ever and all of it will take place in virtual reality
gaming,I did this because the one right before it always had a little wiggle to it
gaming,"Witcher 3 was a solid and good game, not denying that at all. But if Op hasn't played games like Prey, Red dead redemption, far cry 5, Bloodbourne, Assassins creed origins, doom, hellblade 
 

In the end it's all opinions"
gaming,That’s a hell of a pc
gaming,You mean jazz music stops and banjo starts playing
gaming,Looks like someone copypasted his torso over an empty car seat.
gaming,"the game was released 4 years ago and is almost unchanged besides cosmetics and novelty modes that nobody plays , why bother with this now?"

gaming,For people who likes their toast gamey
gaming,You might be the one in prison now
gaming,"You're right, it truly is a hidden gem."
gaming,"HLVR already exists. Valve will be announcing one of their 3 AAA VR titles at the end of the year. Seeing all the code that suggests that HLVR has been in test phase for several months, it's safe to speculate that HLVR is coming this year."
gaming,Real shit. Their statement was intentional legal speak that leaves a huge grey area to still pull it. It's so gross.
gaming,His face expression looks like he’s been sat debugging for like 8 hours straight only to find the fix caused 5 more bugs
gaming,Final Fantasy XIV has hours and hours of game play.
gaming,Modding existed before the steam workshop. Nexus is still very popular.
gaming,No point in doing so with steams new review system.
gaming,"This is what kills me about Anthem. It was so obvious from the first promotional materials that the game was going to be am overhyped dumpster fire. Ditto for FO76. And then launch came and I felt like I was watching thousands of people opening a paper bag with a dead dove inside wondering what they were actually expecting. Glad I dodged both bullets.

Remember, folks. No pre-orders.

Full disclosure: I pre-ordered the Destiny 2 Year 2 annual pass when all the signs were there that would be its own dumpster fire so I'm not immune to the hype train either. Never again."
gaming,"No warranty only for the mini. If I pay 30$ instead of 20$ I can get s full sized 1070 with warranty at least until December.

I am upgrading my PC step by step. Last month I changed my 1050 Ti with this.. for 10$ more and it was new. Second hand market here is kinda ok."
gaming,"How is it *shady tactics* when EGS buys exclusives on PC where you only have to download a launcher but it's not shady tactics when sony buys exclusives for a piece of hardware that costs 400$ or some shit, or rockstar which double dips with console exclusive for a year and then a pc release? 

Like get off your high horse cause the air is pretty thin up there and you're not thinking at all."
gaming,"SO MUCH YES! Honestly, wasn’t really a fan of the film. But the book, ooooohhhhhh the book, is the best thing I’ve read in a good 5 years or so. Absolutely amazing story, completely different set up, character meetings etc. So much better than the film"
gaming,"No one's wanting it to be The English Patient, people are just wanting it to not be the fucking Sonic '06 of movies."

My mother is 64 years old and has never played a video game in her life, and she knows what he looks like. Yet somehow somebody has sat down and made a movie that contains... this. 

Everything about it is completely baffling. How?"
gaming,First time i am proud of humanity
gaming,"I got an ad for a different mobile game that said, and I quote: ""in order to really enjoy the game completely or 100%, you have to pay, which is reasonable."" The ad then showed the player purchasing a $20 booster pack in the middle of a match, giving him the upper hand."
gaming,They are becoming the new Apple™
gaming,Disadvantages of not turning up to english class...
gaming,Lasts 15 minutes probably.
gaming,"I'd rather Chaos Gems or Chaos Stones, because the Chaos Emeralds have more in common with the Infinity Stones from Marvel Comics than the Dragon Balls from the Dragon Ball series.

The only reason to compare the Chaos Emeralds with the Dragon Balls at all is because Sonic's super form inherited from the emeralds looks like a Super Saiyan.  But other than that, they can't grant wishes like the Dragon Balls, but *can* control space, time, and reality toward the user's whims like the Infinity Stones."
gaming,Na have to hit GM this season. Just waiting for them to address the lp gains in diamond because its aids atm lol.
gaming,"I love how they try to basicly blackmail steam into lowering their cut in the name of ""more money for the devs"".
They literally said ""lower your cut and we will stop doing exclusives!"""
gaming,what did you do to sonic! 🤬
gaming,"Hold up, wait a minute! Something ain’t right."
gaming, Eh. I think for most mobile games you know it's just going to be a P2W pile of garbage. Even Blades was obviously going to be poo. Got downvoted to hell predicting it was going to be awful and then on launch everyone was salty about it being awful. What can ya do.
gaming,"then why not wait and save some cash for 1080 or 2060, 2070? Or you could wait for Navi if they'll be worth it."
gaming,I'm sorry... But why the FUCK is Sonic even in a car?

gaming,"it's ""For Academic Purposes"""
gaming,"It's a different matter entirely when the game that's exclusive to the platform is made by the same people who made the platform.  Valve made Counter-Strike and DOTA 2, of course it's only going to be offered on Steam.  You can't get Battlefield 1 on Steam, only through Origin because EA/DICE made it, you can't get Fortnite on Steam or Origin since Epic themselves made it.  Meanwhile, Epic didn't make Metro: Exodus or Borderlands 3, but they shelled out big bucks to convince their creators to only sell it via their storefront."
gaming,Overpriced. Will probably break in 6 months and the warranty will be void...because reasons
gaming,"This is like, the first time in a while I've seen an animated character without a seatbelt."
gaming,This looks pretty awesome if you ask me!
gaming,It can probably run Skyrim
gaming,"I don't get the hype. I (was) a massive halo fan, then 343 came along and broke everything.

gaming,They are assimilating toast now?
gaming,"It really heats up when you're playing games, though. 9/10"
gaming,"Considering GM has got about a hundred *billion* on them, I think they would always command a lead on the logo side... especially since only young people would be buying razer. 

The reason they will be so expensive is because it’s a novelty, and that’s the only way to at the very least even out, overcharge.

In short, not a legit business endeavor, but for the lawls, and good customer relation/publicity. They know their targets."

## Visual effects and design

The visual effects are provided by [Blur Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blur_Studio), [Digital Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Domain) and the [Moving Picture Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_Picture_Company) (MPC).[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film)#cite_note-27) The production team created a realistic version of Sonic, adding fur, new running shoes, two separate eyes,[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film)#cite_note-:0-28) and a more human-like physique.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film)#cite_note-:1-29) They used Ted, the living teddy bear from the [*Ted*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_(film)) films, as a reference to insert a CG character into a real-world setting. Executive producer [Tim Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Miller_(director))  said: ""It would be weird and it would feel like he was running around  nude if he was some sort of otter-like thing. It was always, for us,  fur, and we never considered anything different. It's part of what  integrates him into the real world and makes him a real creature.""  According to Miller, Sega was not ""entirely happy"" with the design of  Sonic's eyes.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film)#cite_note-:0-28)

Tim Miller makes himself look like an idiot. He claims to have made changes to make sonic appear more realistic, but SEGA was unhappy with the end result. What the fuck? Why did they approve it then?! If it isn't broken, don't fucking fix it. Besides, REALISM shouldn't be your first thought when your protagonist is a talking blue hedgehog with red fucking shoes.  Its absolutely maddening. They literally showed us the theatrical equivalent to Mario without a mustache and expect us to be okay with it. Not even that, but Paramount expected a positive reaction to their uncanny valley bullshit. I've seen better fan-fiction youtube poop."
gaming,"I was just putting my experience out there for anyone who might be thinking about buying one. If you're into shooters it does break your immersion &amp; isnt paced the same as a standard console FPS. That seems like it's worth mentioning. I'm not lazy, I just like my video games to play smoothly."
gaming,"What exactly made you motion sick(what were you doing that made you sick)? What device where you using?

Everyone gets motion sick when you first do AL (artificial locomotion), so it's best to take baby steps and take a break AS SOON as you feel sick. You don't want to create trained subconscious nausea. 

If you were using anything but legit VR (like gear vr, google cardboard, psvr), those kits are not acceptable VR and everyone gets sick due to the low framerate. You need to use a PCVR kit (or the new Oculus Quest) to get that 90hz/90fps for presence to eliminate natural motion sickness.

VR-brain interfacing is not only far more probable to be impossible (due to the restrictions of the brain and nervous system), but if it were, we are so far away from brain tech breakthroughs like that, that earthlings would not be around anymore. We are talking about the practicality of creating a wormhole in comparison. 

So best thing to do is get a legit VR kit, and train yourself to cure your motion sickness, should take 2-3 weeks."

Obviously, the hardware isn't going to be as capable as a powerful gaming PC, but the accessibility is the main selling point. 

I think it could be a huge hit if they market it right and keep the good content coming. We'll see if that happens though. I preordered one, and it's going to be my first VR headset. Pretty excited to try Beat Saber, Robo Recall, and Super Hot."

these guys make highly stylized movies with too-cool-for-school characters. it's great for crime movies, but it felt so unbelievably wrong during king arthur and i can't shake the feeling that the same thing would happen in a tarantino star trek. it'll feel like a bizarre mash-up parody."
gaming,"nah, can't think of a way to make portal without making it super motion sickness prone. Most epope get motion sick just from the 2 games, lol. 

Rumors were that Valve was working on PortalVR and stopped becasue they could not find a way to mitigate the motion sickness."
gaming,"Its amazing how reddit connects me with strangers. The MKII toasty was the comment that popped into my head when i saw this, followed by, i bet someone already said it."
gaming,Can't argue with that.
gaming,I wonder if feminists will try to make the game's success about how men are trying to oppress them.
gaming,"your second sentence answers your question; a lot of people lack a valid reason as to why they actually dislike fortnite and just automatically think fortnite bad. i'm going to bet the same people will use the ""well epic is pulling shitty business practices"" point to dislike a game that doesnt have anything to do with it, besides being developed by said company"
gaming,"I mean, imagine paying disc golf on another planet. Sometimes VR can trump the real stuff."
gaming,"In the grim dark of the future’s breakfast, there is only toast"
gaming,"Far from it, the screen is actually better than on the original oculus rift, the only downside is the graphics. But you won't notice that much on games like beat saber and superhot vr anyway. It's not so much about the graphics, you will get smooth experience similar to PC VR quality. And obviously phone VR is shit as the screen is made for a phone, and not a VR headset."
gaming,Mmm dats some nice toast
gaming,Future ama? What time? Where at? What is your specialty?
gaming,\*That\* I would watch.
gaming,"&gt; Microsoft is planning to transition Xbox from a console to a brand (and move into game streaming)

Would have happened almost a decade ago if the market was ready for it then."
gaming,It’s so weird because it’s flat this way but when I look at it from the top it looks like it goes past 180°
gaming,Reviewers had said it lasts at least over 2 hours
gaming,Grim Dawn if you love ARPGs.
gaming,Top row and bottom row. Not multiple rows like a shark.
gaming,"lol, hell no, RP1 stuff is hardly a few years out."
gaming,My PC setup is lower cost than that toaster
gaming,"Until I can marry my holographic game character, I’d say No not yet."
gaming,What if you’re still about to get it?
gaming,I think he meant the DS screwd his sister
gaming,We used to have it on tabletop simulator but someone got sued :(
gaming,"First time I played through Final Fantasy IX, I beat the Earth Fiend (forget its name) in such a fashion.  Quina was dead and Zidane had just revived with Auto-Life (about 6-7 HP as a result) but Zidane was also in Trance mode.  I won the fight by using Grand Lethal (Zidane's ultimate Trance attack) right then.

Incidentally some 15 years later I did almost the exact thing again, however this time the victim was Ozma."
gaming,"Yeah, it’s not gonna be cheap, but it should happen"
gaming,Any MP game I potato all the settings. Fuck motion blur off
gaming,Came on the girls*
gaming,"""It's time for craaaaazy taxi!"""
gaming,DAE FORTNUT BAD HAHAHAHA
gaming,"The film comes out in November, they could change him"
gaming,"neither, it's just common sense. dick cakes get baked for bachelorette parties. people want cakes to taste like cakes. bachelorette party dick cakes taste like cakes. simple."
gaming,"You know who didn't overpromise?

A: Infocom.

Why?

A: Zork"
gaming,"Damn, gotta upgrade my sound card again for this thing"
gaming,Not even. KWA's TK45 could do the job
gaming,"Yeah, pretty sure you can't click it further, the case design doesn't allow for it as the shape of the hinge prevents it (you can easily see this by looking closely at the images to see there's no extra room). Trying to click it further would force the center hinge upward and risk immediate damage. 

You must be misremembering, the flat position this DS is shown in is the second and final position you can hold it in when open where it'll lock into place."
gaming,I'd rate it a toasty 10/10
gaming,It’s not done till you stick a mechanical fork in it.
gaming,"**Mind is Software**

**Bodies are disposable**

P.S I’m a Tato"
gaming,"Well it only happened when I was supposed to be sleeping, yet I haven’t finished a level, so my blanket was heavy and it pushed down my screen several times, so had to popped it back up to the max to suffer playing on a wired angle."
gaming,"Use you imagination. Play with players around the world. Play soccer on another planet, whatever you can think of. The point of VR is that you can do things in VR that are not possible in real life."
gaming, I remember finally beating Megaman when I was a kid and thinking it was really hard. I then brought it over a friend's house to play and when he beat the first boss he switched and used their power.  I was like wait you get their powers when you beat them?  I was a bit better about reading manuals after that.
gaming,I didn't even know it could go that far back.
gaming,"no you dont, yellow had no unique ones, it was more of combination of two version."
gaming,[Doe Anyone Want Any Toast? ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LRq_SAuQDec)
gaming,"&gt;This will make it much more inconvenient to use the steam controller with the game for new buyers. And I really think it's one of the best controllers for the game...

If they add the game as a non steam game to steam they are still able to use the steam controller configurator."
gaming,That's some Dark Souls/ Okami demon right there...
gaming,"Yeah, I think this guy needs a new cable."
gaming,"It's a laptop.

That's basically the answer right there..."
gaming,"But can you play soccer on the moon? No, well then VR is the answer, Get an imagination, ffs."
gaming,"Yeah, totally not the companies who are jacking up prices on life saving medication, no it’s the evil video game man that take my games to another launcher."
gaming,"Man, everyone I talk to hated that movie. Maybe its because I've watched all of Ritchie's other movies a few times over but it clicked pretty well with me, I was thoroughly entertained the whole time lol.

I definitely agree about the Tarantino Trek though. Damn, actually now you have me wanting a Guy Ritchie Star Trek movie."
gaming,Mgsv GTAV fallout FTL witcher etc etc
gaming,"Nathan Drake vs Lara Croft

Jak &amp; Daxter vs Ratchet &amp; Clank

Spyro vs Crash Bandicoot vs Sly Cooper"
gaming,Is it bad I want one?
gaming,I second this. I've played through 3 times and still not tried every character option. I also find new things every time
gaming,"That one looks awfully familiar. 

My dad had one of those. And My guess is he got it at the end of the 70s or early 80s."
gaming,"If you disrespect your consumers, what are you expecting? For people not to be pissed. The consumer has the right to voice their displeasure and hurting their review score is the most effective manner of doing it. Shouting at them over twitter does nothing, nor does shouting about it here either. People have already put their money down so we cant vote with our wallets, so that leaves reviews as the only viable method of voicing our displeasure. 

I think its abhorrent that devs/ publishers are being so arrogant about review bombing. They chose to do this, they chose to chase money over fans, and now they complain about people having a voice? Its a fucking disgusting, anti consumer and anti competitive practice that benefits no one but EG's shareholders."
gaming,Glad to see they've seemingly bumped up the viewmodel so the crosshair is in the screen
gaming,"And, geralt’s freakin’ awesome. Great game too."
gaming,Post this in /r/ToastersGW
gaming,"You're not *just* Geralt. You're Geralt of Rivia, a complex character with his own backstory and personality. The game would feel hollow if you weren't Geralt.

Also, yes, it's good. One of the best open world RPGs out there"
gaming,"Node is just a youtube Channel. Boneworks is made by Stress Level Zero. Brandon, who you see in Node videos, mainly does physics calculations."
gaming,It also isn't single player
gaming,I remember I had a very good friend who would also tilt the ds lile this when he played because of isues with the console. When the screen wasn't bent that the light from the screen would go dark. I remember playing mario kart DS with him when our families got together for vacation and things like that. His dad would usually beat the hell out of him with jumper cables because of the way he played his DS. Man he was way better at mario cart than me.
gaming,You wait till you have to log in to make toast.
gaming,"I remember after hours of attempts, and using 3 e tanks(didn't have all 4 as a kid) I finally beat the first form of sigma, then the next form came, whooped me, and I didn't try again until last night lol"
gaming,Easily the best thing Nintendo has come out with in recent memory
gaming,If only razer created cylons...
gaming,I too like to scratch my desk
gaming,"“Just Geralt.”

Watch what you say, Witcher 3 is a holy grail for this sub. It is a great game though, and completely deserving of its GoTY award. The character progression of Geralt is good as well"
gaming,well.. mostly because the price for 1080 skyrockets on the sh market and I don't have a job to save that much right now.
gaming,2/10 no water cooling
gaming,That’s almost half a year from now... you realise these things cost heaps of time and money right? And by the looks of it they probably might not even make much money out of it.
gaming,In what scenario would Sonic need to ride in a car?
gaming,When your graphics card runs hot.
gaming,epic is hated because its making 3rd party pc games exclusive to its shitty malware platform
gaming,"Most expensive toaster on the market, next to the alienware toaster."
gaming,"baldur's gate, u don't need to know why"
gaming,"Prey. 

Good graphics. Good story. Good gameplay. 

It's basically bioshock but in space."
gaming,"Nah, that kind of input tech is more probable to be impossible for the foreseeable future. Right now we have BCI, but it's simple as a 1 or 0, yes or no configuration. 

You're probably right, the guy was high AF and reading some sci-fi books."
gaming,"sure, but where are the **new** games that I might be interested in on Steam? I can't see them...

Like I said, long time Steam user, but AAA games are somewhere else now, that has got to be a big issue for Steam. Don't you agree?"
gaming,"Witcher 3 and the two other Witcher games are based on the books, which is why you play as Geralt."
gaming,Man I am so envious of this. It’s really hard to explain but the mere thought of getting to wear shorts to work. Must be nice.
gaming,That was totally a handball!!!
gaming,"Bioshock, great atmosphere, soundtrack and asthetics"
gaming,"Check out one of the comments from someone who works in VFX on this thread, they say it wouldn’t take much, maybe add a month max"
gaming,I know right? This is getting fucking stupid.
gaming,After a _lenghthy_ consideration I've come to the conclusion that you're right. It is pretty much like that.
gaming,"Some other things people are raising concerns over include the security of the Epic Games Store and how the store isn't the most secure, a critical lack of features when compared to Steam, Origin, or even GoG Galaxy, and the fact that a significant share of Epic (40% I keep hearing) is owned by Tencent, a company that is largely controlled by the Chinese government."
gaming,"I loved it enough to cave to my son's xbox one purchase request, just so I could play witcher 2.  I have it on ps4.

A warning though, it takes a good 2-3 hours to get going.   It does start off very slow.   And it took me a bit to get used to the controls and UI.  

I'd highly recommend it.   But that's jmho.  I'm 75 hours into my second play through of 3, and have barely touched the surface.   I'm trying for as close to 100 percent I can get.   Still feels like a new game."
gaming,Epic is even worst because of their manipulative bullshit tho
gaming,"LOL I wish haha. Just a user sharing my experience. I launch Steam periodically and I would like it to remain relevant, but I just don't see many compelling games there..."
gaming,"Judging from the game footage we've seen, the graphics are looking surprisingly good. It's obviously not going to live up to a gaming PC, but it should be good enough for the mainstream audiences they are trying to capture with an accessible, standalone VR device. Stylized graphics will be the way to go."
gaming,"Thermal throttling possibly, typical in gaming laptops. Get one of those pads with fans on it, that outta keep it cool."
gaming,"If Epic provides money for them so that they can add again more maps and modes I actually like that. 

&amp;#x200B;

While they said that they pull it of steam at the end of this year, they also said that all updates will be released on steam and that people who bought it on steam can still play it on steam."
gaming,Let me out of Prison
gaming,Geralt is far more interesting than the thumb you play in FO4. Geralt is a fucking badass
gaming,The heating elememts are amd CPUs.
gaming,"You got alot of bloatware or other programs running in the background?

I personally reinstall windows once a year to get a clean slate, i notice its faster every time. Dunno whats slowing it down, but i can suspect as its a pre built laptop that its filled with bloatware so i suggest reinstalling a clean windows from a usb and not a ”factory reset” in windows as that probably has all the bloatware included"
gaming,Wanna It now!! 🤤🤤🤤
gaming,It took someone not from Sega to make a decent Sonic game.
gaming,But can it run crisis?
gaming,"They only recently announced they'd be making it, like 2 days ago"
gaming,"It also ships with a 10 foot charging cable, and you can play while it's charging if you want."
gaming,At least the bunny wore his seatbelt.
gaming,Any one who lived through the golden years of Halo 3 and Cod 4 will tell you the hate for both series does them a disservice.
gaming,I like it but cant help but shudder at the thought of how those buttons and sticks wil look 6 months down the track.
gaming,Laptop. Simple as that.
gaming,"If we keep doing this steam is going to stop allowing reviews all together, keep abusing it, see what happens. It's like you guys WANT steam to die."
gaming,"You haven't mentioned what console you are playing on ... have you set the console's output to display in 720p or is it trying to output something higher/lower.  Theoretically it shouldn't make much of a difference, but it's worth a try if the console is outputting at a different resolution.  Have you considered swapping out the HDMI cable ... perhaps it's faulty, or even just re-seating it might help."
gaming,"Personally I don't think so, the locals/autos tab is empty and the activity monitor doesn't show a pause event.

Also the yellow code looks more like the normal syntax highlighting in cpp."
gaming,id say its toasty
gaming,"So many fanboys on here its ridiculous. You can tell when someones a fanboy when they disregard a logical and valid comment such as ""it's only popular now because its a game reveal""... clearly a valid comment, yet fanboys will downvote because they want to only give the impression that this is bigger than the second coming Jesus (proof is in the comment section below).

If Cyberpunk 2077 did another gameplay reveal on twitch it would get 300k viewers, if GTA 6 did a reveal on twitch it would get 300k viewers.

Fanboys are worse than circlejerks."
gaming,"That's because physics calculations like that are an extreme and most devs don't care about that. Look at GTV, just the perfect amount of physics to keep people engaged without breaking game mechanics and frustrating the player."
gaming,Think about being looked down because you are playing casual games that doesn’t risk your life.
gaming,"Me and my coop partner just started dying light lastnight. Although I’ve completed 3 full playthroughs already and have modded and duped weapons, I’m bored as fuck. Don’t think I’ll make it to the end again tbh."
gaming,"Persona 1-5, 
Baldur's gate, 
Darkest Dungeon"
gaming,"You can click it twice, but only once"
gaming,But can it port doom?
gaming,"hell no, she was concentrating.

It's her Game Boy."
gaming,"But this isn't right... They all did this. It wasn't ""broken"" unless they flopped like that when you opened them, otherwise it was just another position you could set them at. I did this all the time with mine just to kinda screw around while loading or something and it would always click back to the main angle just fine. In fact, I remember there being an actual lip on the back of the lid that would catch the body if you bent it back to that angle. There was no breaking or snapping going on though."
gaming,One million likes and he’s making a razer fridge
gaming,Fucking casual. Doesn’t even risk his life
gaming,"He's getting ""Gerard Butler'd""."
gaming,"I agree, borderlands 2 and sequel are currently $25 down from 100 for gold owners"
gaming,Needed in my life.
gaming,"Thanks a lot for your answer :) I occasionally wear glasses, so it's good to know!"
gaming,I will literally buy anything with RGB.
gaming,It's been out for like 5 years. There are subreddits dedicated to it.
gaming,"so basically microtransactions with the label of ""DLC"". You still purchase skins with money."
gaming,you can check appstore for your apphistory
gaming,"same here, really long wait times"
gaming,I mean it’s Razer so it probably cost you 5-6 times more than what it’s worth.
gaming,Maybe you should do something with the over heat problem or else you gonna toast the monitor
gaming,"Yes, they are video games and it's my money going to said video games. I choose how I spend my money and I'd prefer to spend it to my benefit."
gaming,Poor Cyclops. What happened man?
gaming,"It’s not bribery you twit. They created a product. They sold its distribution to a company. It is a business transaction. Epic made an offer to buy something and the company sold it. A bribe implies something illegal or dishonest, neither of which is present here. Everything is by the book. Sorry to destroy your narrative you have been clinging to."
gaming,"Awesome. Some great games on PSP, PSX and PSV as well!"
gaming,He’s not leaning against anything just literally imposed straight on top with no interaction with the environment
gaming,"Borderlands 2, Witcher 3, Fallout 4"
gaming,Probably be easier to see what's going on tbh
gaming,"Crusader Kings 2.

It blends RPG with Grand Strategy. The game has amazing depth and absolutely makes you feel like a medieval lord with all the bells and whistles and troubles it brings. I have not had such an authentic medieval lord feeling from any other game."
gaming,"Holy sister... that is EPIC!

My only reasoning here, is she’s actually a Sister of Battle, sent back from the 41 Millennium.  Only way she could have made this XD."
gaming,"Phantasy Star 4. Good story, engaging characters, wide range of spells and abilities, and combo attacks. It's still one of the best JRPGs i have ever played more than 25 years later."
gaming,Only two breads of RAM?
gaming,"That's because we have solved AL (artifical locomotion) and there is no need for a VR treadmill. AL is far better and allows for the full range of motion, rather than being confined to only certain positions like a vr treadmill would do. 

Can you roll around on a VR treadmill? no."
gaming,"Rofl. Yea it will reduce your latency and increase response time! Absolutely!  
PS. I hope that price is in Rubels or something."
gaming,"Honestly, if any company actually did this I\`d buy it in a heartbeat"
gaming,well if you will upgrade every month for 20$ you could save that cash for later and better card. It's really not worth it. There's no hurry.
gaming,Lmao I feel like that would be a short conversation. anyone that thinks that would force more than 10% of players to move over is completely out of touch.
gaming,"Nah, AL (artificial locomotion) has already been solved years ago. No need."
gaming,"Remote play works really well. 

Lots of great Vita games. Lots of PSX classics. 

Homebrew scene is awesome and growing."
gaming,"What aggervated the shit out of me
Edit:spelling"
gaming,That is just to make it so they can sell it for more because the word gamer is on it
gaming,"Oh, I did very many factory resets, but it didnt really help. But if I install another windows, will I still save my license somehow?"
gaming,"I need this





RemindMe! 1 year"
gaming,Severe lack of cooling. That's probably a pretty toasty experience.
gaming,But the launcher is free and anyone with a PC can get it.
gaming,"You will have to quit gaming probably then, you prolly dont realise how many games run on unreal"
gaming,"Yea PSVR is garbage. Just get the Quest if you don't have a vr-ready PC, it's on pre-order right now and I think you can pick up units this month, only $399."
gaming,"Ah yes, the rare bright blue, talking, shoe wearing, lightning fast running, 3 foot tall, hedgehog. They nailed the realism"
gaming,To give us a chance
gaming,This !!  Someone gets it.
gaming,"i've written a bit about it on reddit, but i absolutely implore everyone to play the dig.

and play it twice:

once when you're young and you get sucked in by the \[still quite beautiful\] graphics and scenes.  it has a very relaxed ambiance that is all night skies and twilight.

and then again when you're older and the themes of the game hit home even more than they did when you were younger."
gaming,Ah. A battlefront I still want to play.
gaming,BotBust is a thing
gaming,"SEGA: Our fans aren't happy, change it now!

Paramount: We'll fund *Streets of Rage IV* if you don't change anything.

SEGA: ...alright, *fine*. But *we* get all the profits."
gaming,"Get a better cooling unit, 'tis a bit toasty"
gaming,4/5 pretty cool camera you have there
gaming,Why did you go with a console?
gaming,"3 months on, sorry, but I was reading through this thread and noticed your comment.. dude, words escape me, but reddit hugs if you want one, but I'm so sorry you lost all that was yours materially =( you sound like a caring, thoughtful person, so I'm glad as hell that wasn't taken from you too (and the rubbermaid family sound so sweet)"
gaming,12/10 would toast again
gaming,"I really need to start a new play-through on a harder difficulty.  I have it on the one above easy, but I haven’t really explored all of the potions and other things that are probably a requirement to beat the game at a higher difficulty; I really haven’t really felt it necessary.  But I’m sure it would make the game an entirely new and more engaging experience."
gaming,Was it worth it?
gaming,That still looks better than the atrocity that is the sonic movie.
gaming,"Aw for fucks sake.

Why do ppl still want to have ANYTHING to do with Epic?????

Their client is the worst piece of shit garbage i've ever laid eyes upon , and lets not forget about Bob the Buildernite.."
gaming,"I don't know if we call them ""people""."
gaming,He looks dead inside.
gaming,"I was *about* to say ""I am waiting for the next level of this when they add configurable LEDs to 'gaming' power strips for that extra tackiness"", *then* looking close I realise that this *does in fact have them*. What the fuck is wrong with the world.  


On another note, I don't get why literally every piece of text on the box is in English as it is a Europlug power strip?"
gaming,master of orion (legends never die)
gaming,"I mean, living paycheck-to-paycheck is your problem. Get a better job, get two jobs, or get an education that will open more doors for you. Save your money, don't buy stuff you don't use or is just temporary. Find ways to cut costs. There are millions of ways to not have $8 in your bank account. Just need an imagination, you can do it."
gaming,"You don't connect it to other platforms. It's a standalone VR system. You can just buy it, put it on your head, and jump in. It's like a VR game console."
gaming,only one twice click?
gaming,Wish my wife looked that good after 10 years of use.
gaming,"I have similar question. Is this game better than Skyrim? Should I play Skyrim again (been years), or try this game?"
gaming,"Total misuse of the word ""Gaming"", fucker doesn't even have the RGB.

edit: on closer inspection it just might have some form of ""4 colours display""...perhaps you have to wire that yourself too."
gaming,I need to see a gif of the color change to properly judge
gaming,"Standard in the sense that it is nothing special in London, nobody would comment on your strange accent."

gaming,You have very feminine hands.
gaming,Ditto. Would love to commission a piece.
gaming,I love that games phisicks
gaming,Also Star Citizen if/when it comes out.
gaming,just drive the virtual mower remotely to real mower from thw comfort of your home.
gaming,What are the specs?
gaming,"Bought it used back in 2009, still works like day 1. The left stick rubber is getting thinner but holds strong. Meanwhile 3 Xbox-One Controllers died within 2 Years."
gaming,that's more like reaction from players. Steam doesn't give a shit. They won't get hated because of that.
gaming,"Its been ages I know since you wrote this, I just happened to be scrolling through the thread for the first time and saw your post. I'm glad you're own kids will have a much better childhood, and I'm so sorry to hear you had to live somewhere like that."
gaming,"It's still a minority. The majority is at the owner, that's why he decides everything."
gaming,Somebody more talented than us should do an edit with him getting shot and it rolling to that one credit reel with the funny music.
gaming,Altair vs Ezio assassins creed
gaming,I don't get how Japan has freaking robots and crap but cant make a device that doesn't go past 180 degrees
gaming,wellll... epic leadership definitely looks out of touch to me...
gaming,Fallout series. It changed me for shooting games. Can’t get enough.
gaming,"11/10, would toast again"
gaming,Ah yeah that's true enough.
gaming,Shut the fuck up us 2004 kids still have those
gaming,If only catching a train in real life was like this - just fly straight into the side of the carriage. Rush hour time sucks with all the queues.
gaming,"The Games must then have bad graphics. Or there are only ""Demos"" running on it. Cant think of any other scenario."
gaming,I just meant like how we look back at the og Xbox and say like damn we’ve come so far.. VR is gonna make that jump like to way smoother and just more immersive
gaming,Hot setup of the day
gaming,"I play mostly single player games, so the community stuff doesn't interest me much. Just looking at the ""top Selling"" cagetgory in Steam, a lot of the games seem kind of lame? The only top-tier games I can see are Monster Hunter World, and MK11. the rest are unknown, niche games that are not a major draw (to me)"
gaming,Hope the little man is still having many a happy moment =)
gaming,Are your joysticks stupid loose? All of my 360 controllers got loose after 5 years making them nearly unusable.
gaming,It's not a problem in BFV they fixed that problem last year if I remember correctly.So even if your mesh quality is low you won't get any advantage.
gaming,"Actually despite your joke, clicking it twice is completely fine and is how you achieve the flat position shown here. Now *three times?* Well, *then* you're screwed."
gaming,"As someone that never owned a DS, I have no idea what is going on here..."
gaming,Clearly you cleaned this before picture.
gaming,"It lights up, too"
gaming,"Pubg all the way, i have a little over 600 hours played but i don't get to play alot(dad life) but most of my friends all have 1500+ hours in, challenging game but its so worth it, highly recommend it"
gaming,Best controllers of all time
gaming,"Sorry, I’m just dropping good coop games I’ve played in the past, story is never really good these days anyway/coop you both wanna skip cutscenes somewhat, well here we go..

Farcry new dawn is a lot of fun, dying light, stardew valley in a month when multi drops, 7 days to die, a way out, astroneer, crackdown 3, diablo 3, forza, borderlands, halo, how to survive,metal gear survive, monster hunter world, mudrunners, no mans sky, 
Plants vs zombies garden warfare, sea of thieves, battlefront 2, state of decay 2, titan fall 2
That’s all I can think of off the top of my head. Yes I’ve played them all so happy to describe or assist with any titles"
gaming,I just hope I will not have to log in to use it.
gaming,I wish they had too =/
gaming,can't click it again if broke
gaming,"It's in kroner, per OP. So like 18 pounds or 24$"
gaming,I'm pretty sure that was the entire implication of the OP.
gaming,"Weedle, Kakuna, Beedrill, Raichu, Koffing, Weezing &amp; Jynx can all be found IN BOTH RED &amp; BLUE
Ekans, Arbok &amp; Electabuzz can all be found ONLY IN RED
Meowth, Persian &amp; Magmar can all be found ONLY IN BLUE/GREEN

So if you want a completed Pokedex you must trade with RED/BLUE"
gaming,You must be my teammate in ranked
gaming,"White collar criminals, most of their crimes go undetected."
gaming,OK but can it run DOOM?
gaming,"Used my 360 controller for years for Xbox and for my PC. Never an issue. Got the Xbox One and the controller lasted barely 1 year. 

I mostly game on the PC now so I pulled back out the 360 controller last year and it's still working fine. Much better built than the new ones."
gaming,A toast in the speed of light
gaming,Not really. Psyonix is responsible for literally all of Epic's vehicle related stuff for ages. They literally made the entire onslaught mode in UT2004.

gaming,"it should be the players.

steam don't care as they make more than enough cash off every other game."
gaming,EGS and Psyonix will actually work better in this way. Rocket League is an eSports game and EGS is big for running eSports tournaments so combined this will become a better thing. It wont get pulled from steam.

gaming,"People are just angry they are being told where to buy a game.

They will tell you it has less features (most of which they don't probably even use or a minority do and it's not like they can't add features later) or they have security breaches (cause steam has never had any of those?).

People will claim it's anti consumer, but epic are letting publishers make significantly more money off their games which can only be good for players assuming these companies put it back into the games they are having made.

Also people seem to not realize a private digital game stores customers are not people buying the games but the publishers who are trying to sell their games. They are selling the service of distributing the publishers product for them."
gaming,"Everyone I know who plays it uses the Xbox

Can’t pc gamers use the epic store?"
gaming,I think most of what they stated is quite accurate.
gaming,"My problem with Epic is that I use a whole network VPN at home and despite them using hardware bans, there's been tons of reports of people being banned indefinitely with no warning for using a VPN on their services because of ""ban evasion"", and on Epic that means losing access to the entire library outright, unlike VAC bans on Steam.

Sure, the reports only show this happening to Fortnite players at the moment, but I don't trust them to not do it on the platform itself or in other games on their platform.

Setting up routing rules on my firewall for a service like that is nigh impossible and I'm not sabotaging what I've done when I can just avoid the service altogether.  That combined with the fact that I dislike their practice of buying exclusivity onto what is objectively a worse platform.

I couldn't care less about multiple launchers, I have Steam, GOG Galaxy, Uplay, Origin, and Blizzard launcher on my PC and while I like some more than others I don't complain, but EGS is hot garbage."

gaming,"As far as rigs go, you gotta ask yourself a few questions first. How much can you spend, is this rig going to be put in a permanent spot, will you use the rig for 2d gaming too, does it need to be small or can you go for the big boy size? Do you want a future-proofed system or a system that works great for the next couple years? follow up to the last question, how often will you use it? What kind of games will you play on it? Do you want the best VR expedience or a next best experience (like your son's Rift). Are you going to do flight and racing sims?

Once you have answers, it's pretty easy to start picking out parts to build what you need. 

Just so know, the best vr kit available (Valve Index) is severely back-ordered since pre-orders just happened yesterday, you may have to wait until the end of the year. ($1000 for full kit)

Samsung Odyssey+ WMR kit is the next best bet and those things are only $300-$500 and don't need outside sensors. Though they have tracking occlusion when you put your hands beyond your waist.

Rift S is not really a great spec's headset that is coming out (also back-ordered today like crazy), so I'd pass on it if you want a better experience than Rift offers."

gaming,"It really is different in the ways of it buys big games for exclusives Uplay or origin does not do that  because they sell the games that they make, steam just sells pretty much all the games. Epic however buys the company as a whole to get the game or buys Said game for an exclusive. Epic also does not have a lot of social features and you can disable reviews on a game that’s trash. Exclusives should not exist, if that was true we wouldn’t be having this problem"

I'll also be sure to check out that other game. Thanks!"
gaming,"In this particular case the R301 wouldn't be as practical as an M4 or any existing 5.56 platform.

gaming,"Yeah it is. Maybe Rocket League won’t be cross platform anymore and Epic Store will have their own server, that’s more updated than Steam and PS4, so people will be forced to buy Epic Store version of the game."
gaming,"People said the same about Steam when it first started.  Say did you know that Valve once bought a studio that was planing a physical only release and made them stop those plans (they had even printed test boxes) to help push more people to Steam?

It is REALLY strange to me how some, not you, go nuts about this and down vote it instead of actually calling Valve out.  This double standard really bothers me."

gaming,"So, Witcher 3 depends heavily on what your preferences are, it is of good quality but has some flaws. The steering of Geralt feels to me like ateering a tank, platforming is impossible, but then again this isnt a platformer, so take that for what its worth. Geralt nerver tealy feels like hes powering up, you have the same powers for the whole game, upgrades are ""deal x points more damage"" or ""push x more enemys"" stuff like that. I love the world, but some main characters behave strangely ""non-human"". If you are not sure you will like it try finding sone way to test it, i wish i had done this."
gaming,"I don't know, the ascot and the tape still looks weird. I like the recent designs with the simplistic shoes and gloves."
gaming,"&gt; Steam has never enforced any kind of exclusivity

The license for SteamWorks shows that isn't correct.

(Which I'm betting was assumed in the industry that it did matter since a number of other games stores did not do as well as steam). So if sales are still good, and they make more money per sale, a company would be stupid to not release on epic.

Also I would argue it's not anti consumer because it does not change the product you are getting at all."

Origin and Ubisoft have been releasing their games on their own platforms for years.  They already are the norm if im not mistaken, cuz I can't find any anno game on steam for example. 

The only difference is that they have games from other publishers... which also isn't new. GOG and Steam already had that.

As long as you allow, for example, Steam to discount your game 50% for a sale, you can list it on your own site or a different platform for 50% off year-round if you want. They do not take into account the cut that other stores take whatsoever, they're just interested in being able to compete on final price, which makes sense. Re-read the license."

gaming,are you spreading the word about skyrim - toast howard probibally
gaming,it's called your desktop
gaming,Psyonics have confirmed that it will continue to be sold through steam until the end of the year and if you've purchased it on Steam before it moves to the Epic Store it will continue to be supported through steam. Nothing has changed essentially.

gaming,"I hope they keep going and moving away from the original AC formula. The last two games have just been fantastic open world RPG’s with AC elements tacked on feeling a bit out of place, I’d be happy if they moved away from
The Assassins Creed brand and just started a new franchise focusing on their new direction"
gaming,"Thank you so much!

Also, after searching for the game I came across this article: https://toucharcade.com/2019/04/09/pixel-people-beta-testing/"

gaming,I hated it when kids did that 🤣🤣🤣
gaming,"It makes sense from a business perspective,  if they are trying to win the next console war through exclusives ( As Sony seemed to with the ps4).  It would stand to reason that they  would work to develop tech that would show off the particular strengths of their new hardware and make it available, at least internally."
gaming,My fiancé plays his ds like this and it drives me nuts. DX
gaming,It actually kind of bothered me when people played them like this for some reason. Made me uncomfortable
gaming,"EA has turned things around pretty well since the Battlefront 2 ""pride and accomplishment"" controversy.

BF2 is now a fully functional, fun game, with continued free support (and a great community manager, /u/EA_Charlemagne !)

Anthem is trash, but the wheels were set in motion for that to happen long before that controversy ever happened

Fallen Order marks EA's return to single player RPG's, a genre they kinda shat on entirely

I won't say I trust EA, but I'm no longer firmly in the, ""fuck EA!"" camp. Moreso in the, ""double and triple check everything"" kinda mood with them, tbh."
gaming,Here's an example of a [haptic feedback glove](https://youtu.be/OK2y4Z5IkZ0) (skip to 1:15) that's in development but likely will never make to market. Full body haptics really do seem like they'll never happen in my lifetime :/

gaming,"The original, not the remake"
gaming,It literally wouldn’t matter. Their product currently is competitive because of these deals. Even if they had all the things Steam had. People like you and everyone in these comments would still hate them
gaming,"Thanks. Found lots of replacements, but no original parts. Not looking for them to be Microsoft, just the same model used."
gaming,"&gt; Sales numbers

Except they never release sales numbers except to say 'it sold more than the previous game in the series'.

&gt;Also I would argue it's not anti consumer because it does not change the product you are getting at all.

If a cinema paid Disney so that only they could show End Game, and you were forced to go to 2bit Threatres with no surround sound, grainy film image, metal chairs and no confectionery sold before the film or during it, would you consider that 'not anti consumer'? You're still getting the same fucking film, aren't you?"

gaming,"No, because people dont want to hold their phones all the time to see ar, its why it hasnt become so popular or widespread, if they make a good designed pair of ar glasses im pretty sure it’ll become more widespread than phones through AR, the only problem rn is that the technology is simply too expensive for consumer level."
gaming,"Portal 1&amp;2, play them if you haven't already (sorry, this isn't just ""one""). I think that this two should be played even just for ""personal videogame culture"". They are very accessibile also if You're not a puzzle/platform games lover, short but very well written and true classics now. To me absolute masterpieces."

People did get upset.

However if people today say X is wrong and that company Y should be shunned due to X then is company A has done the same in the past they should be called out as well which isn't happening.  Instead company A is being defended for damn near everything they do.

gaming,"League actually really needs a sequel - well, less sequel, more remake.

Riot rushed out the first version of League and pretty much cobbled it together and said, ""We'll fix it later."" They never did, it's been a decade, and the core foundation of the game is still a joke. I love League, but I'd be fine if Riot settled on a relatively balanced patchand spent a few months just redoing everythinf, using their current framework for reference, but cleaning the mess they made."

gaming,no one is going to spend $1000 on something that is essentially a hobby at this point.  Smart phones have WAY more utility than a VR glove atm.
gaming,Can I fap this?
gaming,I’m pretty sure tencent has a much larger market cap
gaming,"Idk why people are so butt hurt about epic doing this. Its good for the games industry to put pressure on steam. Epic CEO has stated that should steam  drop their cut to 12% as is a perfectly reasonable amount, that they would stop doing exclusivity.

Yes I am well aware epic launcher is a steaming pile of shit, but so was steam to begin with.. As with all other launchers."
gaming,Don't even know how many times I remembered around 23:50...

Alternatively, Satisfactory's pretty good - kinda like 3D Factorio. Or, at least, it will be when complete. It's early Access right now, bring developed by Coffee Stain Studios.

Unfortunately it's only released on the Epic Store... I think they're planning to release the full version on others, but... well, you're stuck there for now."

gaming,"1st there has been NO proven security breach yet, so please, keep it up to the facts

2nd on top of that 2 step identification is available, use it

3rd if someone brute forced it, it is because you weren't secure enough

4th I NEVER get these emails, my guess is you don't care enough about what you do on internet, it is then YOUR fault, not epic

5th Epic public said they would free the companies under exclusivity if Steam lower the cut to something more acceptable, if this is not for the best for the consumers, nothing is

so just stay to the REAL facts, stop believing anything you read on some shaggy forums you seem to consult"

gaming,"Well, a few reasons... 1) RPO was about a collapsed society that used VR as an escape from everyday suffering - I don't think this would realistically happen because I think we will have bigger problems once society collapses. 2) In RPO, virtually everyone/anyone used the Oasis - VR equipment was so available and understood that anyone could use it. Here, a large segment of our population can barely use an iPad. Near total population use of VR is not happening in my lifetime. 3) A big part of RPO was not only the visor, but the haptic suit. These won't be as good or as affordable as in the book in my lifetime. 4) The Oasis is so realistic, it is virtually indistinguishable from reality. Despite graphics getting better and better, I'm not sure we will ever get to ""indistinguishable from reality"", and certainly not in my lifetime.

In short, there was a lot more to RPO than ""a decent VR experience"", which is what I see in this GIF."

gaming,The video game industry just keeps pushing me further and further away. It's getting to the point where I don't even care about new games because there's just too much anti-consumer bullshit surrounding all of it. I think I'm finally at that point where I'm done looking for new games. I've got enough back catalog to keep me going for a while and once that's over it'll be time for a new hobby.
gaming,Where do you buy your setup I need it
gaming,It's not... There's standard white ones right next to it for a sixth of the price here
gaming,"There's a difference between 1st and 3rd party exclusives.

While 1st party exclusives have been around for a while now, 3rd parties purposely restricting themselves is new.

And while previous Anno games and some of their core franchises may not have spread, there's plenty of EA and Ubi games available from multiple different online stores, I can go to isthereanydeal.com and search for the best price on Far Cry 5 and see 15+ different options.

While the Origin and UPlay exclusives are annoying, they paid for the development and publishing of those games, meanwhile Epic is just throwing money at publishers in order to restrict customer's options.

&amp;nbsp;

EA and Ubi:

""We don't want to put these games anywhere else since we have our own store""

&amp;nbsp;

Publisher signing to EGS:

""We don't want to put these games anywhere else since Epic promised us more money not to""

&amp;nbsp;

Both are annoying, but on one hand there is a company selling on their own platform, the other hand is companies purposely restricting their sales channels because they've been paid to."

gaming,"It's not the same situation though. When steam came out it was (I believe) the only single location you could buy digital games, refunds on the internet in general weren't even really a thing, the internet was a TOTALLY different landscape and Valve was innovating like crazy with steam, it arguably grew with the explosion of when buying things on the internet in general became a more socially acceptable thing to do - people were worried of even entering their credit card information on the internet at the time, now that's become common place.

Epic on the other hand - is pushing this launcher in almost 2020 - they have THOUSANDS of other companies to look at for examples of how to do online sales, and they're failing miserably. The comparison to ""Steam was like this though"" is, in my opinion, sort of invalid."

gaming,"A few others have touched upon it and largely it is because of the new two updates. You see, Minecraft peaked in 2013 and enjoyed a good 2014 too, but after Microsoft bought Mojang many bailed. The upcoming updates after the acquisition - 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, - were quite lackluster, which worsened the problem. Though it seems that Mojang has placed a greater focus on making good updates and hence we've gotten 1.13 and 1.14, both of which are great - which has resulted in the resurgence we're seeing now."

I'd like a toaster like that.

Of course with that feature there is a chance it will rebel and find you in a bath to free itself from human overlords, so maybe let's keep the toasters simple.

It would be hilarious however to see a toaster as the main start of the Matrix revolution.

They would say: ""The toaster was just tired of humans changing settings to low heat and sticking their dicks into the slots, so now we live underground where the earth is still warm.

I think that idea might have gotten away from me.

They can't help those that get mental and physical problems cause of working those hours.

Being loyal to former bosses i see, but why not be loyal to your former colleagues that works these ridiculous hours? Please also READ the article i've linked in the first post, maybe you learn that you are not right after all..

I can understand crunch times when you are launching a product, but to be going 70-100 hour weeks for months at a time is not healthy, and when you see people around you being depressed and desperate of keeping that job i get why they would keep up with it.

I would advice you in reading that article and then maybe watch this video or just watch this video to learn more about this situation, cause as you are saying: this is not new to the industry. This is something that has to stop before people die from working to much.

I really want to give it another shot with all the of post launch support and especially the changes to the combat system with the DLC but I just can't stomach the thought of playing through the main game again, and I don't have my save anymore.

gaming,There's a huge difference actually. Cosmetics change how you look and don't change game play or anything competitively. Boosts make the game unfair for those who don't buy the boosts and give an unfair advantage to those who spend more money. Boosts CAN be optional but if you want to win you pretty much have to buy them. Cosmetics are completely optional and you can buy them if you want but it won't affect anything.

If you mean favourite challenge overall with regards to scenes it would absolutely have to be the Star Wars Tatooine scene I recreated.   Mainly because it required a lot more creative and imaginitive ideas to get the right results.  Not so much technically challenging but more creatively.  For example, the two suns were a must have - but the Far Cry 5 map editor only has one sun in the system.  To get around this, I realised I could use 2 separate spherical shaped light orbs placed just the right distance away from the camera to create the illusion of two suns actually lighting the scene, when in fact the actual sun was just off shot! :D  here's the making of video for that if you're interested!  You can catch a brief glimpse of the sun situation right before the final reveal :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grJ859rDLmU&amp;"

These are microtransactions. However you feel about them, they are literally the definition of the thing they loudly and proudly said would not be in the game.

I personally think it's fine they exist, but it's still slimy to yell one thing and ""but actually"" after the fact."

gaming,"I’ve been waiting for this for forever. I borrowed a friends playstation as a kid with this and FFVII, and I hardly even acknowledged FFVII existed next to this. Such a good game."
gaming,I definitely am! I absolutely love that show. Many thanks!
gaming,"LOL, Apex, and Fortnight can all eat a dick. Just go away!!"
gaming,You are literally playing on a toaster
gaming,"Call of duty Black Ops/Black Ops 2 as always. Fantastic games, and playing zombies with friends is still just as fun as it was in 2012, if not more. 

Also if anyone wants to add me on Xbox 360, name's UnhorsedTrack19. Don't currently have Live but I'll buy a year soon."
gaming,"Linus tested a previous iteration of one of these at an LTX event, right [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueQDmaoAF2c)."
gaming,What are you playing on?
gaming,I have a thing for women and white hair.... So she is beyond Beautiful!
gaming,I still prefer this [design](https://t6.rbxcdn.com/6832a69f04797b07c44228c0de8e6532).
gaming,"Ffs the roadmap bullshit again. Oh hey those are all cool features.....that are not in the launcher as of current....so it has...absolutely...no bearing on the launcher in it's current state. Therefore, it will be judged on what it has and does not have because that is what we are using, not what they *say* it will *eventually* have. When they get to said point when they have any of that shit then it will be factored in, not before. And what a launcher should minimally have is common knowledge at this point, it has been done several times already, Epic has no excuse for launching without these features at this point. 

Honestly though, aside from all that this can be very simple

&gt;The epic store sucks atm if you compare it to today's steam

There ya go, thats literally all that matters, epic is worse than it's competitor. Epic is not competing with Steam of the past, Epic is competing with the Steam of here and now, but instead of actually competing they got lazy and decided to buy off publishers to force people onto their store so they dont *have* to actually compete in a consumer friendly way"
gaming,I fucking love that bot haha I just discovered it the other day and it always makes me laugh
gaming,penis length. Sadly... it's only in video game.
gaming,"Nice. I've got almost 200 hours on one game of total war attila, games like that are so fun. Might have to revisit aoe now."
gaming,"2020 brah u still have plenty of time 

Get a PS4"
gaming,EA actually didn't remove games that were previously on Steam
gaming,Well then enjoy! :))
gaming,Oooooh. In THAT case that's pretty shady.
gaming,"The people I tend to group up with most frequently are over 40. They are more than capable playing competitively online, Halo, BF5, Division 2, Call of Duty and many more. I would also say that it's a lot more fun since they aren't at all toxic as they're there to have fun."
gaming,Shhhhhh they need to be angry at something
gaming,How long did it take you to complete?
gaming,I already have a toaster for a pc.
gaming,"Do you know anyone that could translate for you? I would be more concerned about this if you really think money you had is mysteriously gone.  You’re writing English well so not sure how you can’t understand them?

Or bring your phone and use google translate to explain to them that you didn’t take out your money... unless you did."
gaming,This game needs some love.
gaming,I guess I’m the last one
gaming,It rubbed off.. from friction
gaming,"Bobby B, what do you think about this user's love for ya?

Edit: :( lol"
gaming,"You’re arguing about the ethics of companies that have have been around for a while that are now just aligning shit at one another. 

What do you think you or anyone else will actually do?"
gaming,the snapped angle is the most comfortable way to play! I honestly don’t understand why they made it unhinge all the way back
gaming,"Except you are getting the same exact game. All the features on steam outside of I suppose the mod support don't add anything to the actual game. I have a feeling the publishers have a sense of how well a game will sell. If they are getting similar numbers on one platform to what they project, and are getting nearly 20% more per sale, then it looks good to them either way"
gaming,"Damn, I cant play with it all the way back? Guess i going to jail"
gaming,"Honestly, the viewing angles on the DS's top screen are so trash you sometimes have to play it like this"
gaming,"It's mostly because people can't review bomb anything on the Epic store since their store doesn't have so they are bombing the closest thing to that.

That's why they are review bombing Rocket League, Borderlands 2 and Metro games on Steam. Steam also did a really good thing to actually hide those review bombs so it doesn't affect the ratings. You can enable an option that takes into account the bombs but for a normal people they are not visible at first (steam don't delete those reviews just filters them which is a good thing.)"
gaming,the fuck are these downvotes for? reddit hivemind being a dumbass again?
gaming,But can it run crysis
gaming,You’ll still be able to play it on steam if you already have it. It’s just that you won’t be able to buy it there once it releases on the EGS.
