gaming,It's pretty well known and it was a paid product placement. Hamilton advertised the watch around the movie and had an Interstellar page on their website. The biggest product placement was the Carhartt jacket though.   Brands send old merch all the time by the way for movies. Just watch Stranger Things for tons of examples of that. Eggos are prominently featured as Eleven's favorite food.
gaming,Why would we want to?
gaming,"&gt;I cant handle the turn delay, the idea of counter csing, the animations,

&gt; Gatekeep all you like.


**You** said you ""can't handle"" the more difficult mechanics. Lordy Leauge players are all the same.."
gaming,YOU FREAKING FRICKS!!! When will you learn that your actions have CONSEQUENCES???
gaming,Game Fuel fucking sucks. The “new dope ass lid slidy pop top” just jizzes that shit all my lap. Every. Single. Time.
gaming,This movie looks so bad. See you guys opening night!
gaming,He lost most of his attitude.
gaming,Assassin's Creed 2. They're glyphs. Little puzzles you can find that unlocks a video if you complete all 20 of them
gaming,"It's Sonic, what y'all never seen sonic before?"
gaming,For me it's definitely the eyes. I can put up with everything else. The real problem is Paramount holding all of the gold rings.   :/
gaming,All these threads on shitty Sonic made me get a Cherry Limeade.
gaming,Them is some fightin words boss
gaming,I have heard that it is more toxic than Chernobyl
gaming,"Bless you, you have a very positive attitude."
gaming,He was running **760**.
gaming,i don’t know who that guy is but he has 369 acting credits on imdb so that may be a contributing factor
gaming,I'm going to watch this movie believing it's the Sargnarg universe.
gaming,"I don’t know I have the same problem of just looking at games and not feeling I should play them even though one of them could be banger

Like Wolfenstein: The New Order, love that game but I can’t find the urge to play it"
gaming,Its an image file.
gaming,"But CAN dodge a hundred missiles from every direction, and rearrange them to blow up the drones flying around him, apparently ."
gaming,"It’s sonic, sonic is gaming, is it not?"
gaming,You sound like a very sad person. Sorry.
gaming,"Rule number 1 don’t die
Rule number 2 “always help your team”
Rule number 3 don’t use a lsat with a target finder otherwise your bad"
gaming,I actually liked half of the movies on that list. The trick is to have no expectations before watching.
gaming,I mean It’s true
gaming,My fucking eyes can never unhear Luigi’s voice
gaming,"Small bit at the end of the trailer. 

So he will be like this for probably 2 minutes while they establish a sequel hook."
gaming,Can I have one too? :D
gaming,They probably didnt want to rerig a 3d character from scratch so they took a human one and skin that
gaming,I've known very modest voice talent that couldn't tell you what they've done.   I think having an agent does a number on what you remember and having it organized means you may not know exactly what you're doing.   Don't know anything about this guy though.
gaming,You should watch mr fruits vidéo on this
gaming,A movie made for kids to enjoy packed with 90’s nostalgia to help the parents enjoy what they loved as a kid. But sonic looks terrible.
gaming,"Gotta go *fist!* Sanic, sir, can you autograph my fan art of you fisting Sally Acorn?"
gaming,"Exactly. If you don't pay a decent amount to get a mid-tier mobo, ram, and processor, then you're computer will bottleneck. It is really bad to get a shitty mobo/ram/processor and overclock it to keep up with your GPU."
gaming,Spaghetti and meat bawls
gaming,Such a good movie. Wonder if the real guy is like that
gaming,"These days, they gamify the ordering systems and you score free burgers."
gaming,Sonic is a trash series and live adaptations of shit like that are almost always soulless. Who gives a fuck?
gaming,It definitely looks like a furry trying to design their next suit for whatever event furries go to.
gaming,"It's less shaming, more warning.

If I post this next week, there will be people who haven't seen it still who will now see it.

If I post it in two days, there will be people who haven't seen it still who will now see it.

If I post this tomorrow, there will be people who haven't seen it still who will now see it.

If I post this in twelve hours from now, there will be people who haven't seen it still who will now see it.

Repeat for the top ten images made today, and the same ten images are seen the next week, the next day, or even later in the evening. And yet it'd be ""fine"" because there'd always be someone who hadn't seen it yet.

...Also in regards to the image, it's a Common Key with the descriptor that it's going to Yen's temporary room while staying in Skellige. As explained every time this has been posted. Which, even with Reddit's shitty search function I found several versions of in under a minute."
gaming,"""It's a kids movie"" shouldn't give the filmmakers carte blanche to just do whatever it is they feel like. Such an invalid comment I constantly hear about things aimed at children."
gaming,Is this a reference to that one card game?
gaming,"""OMG they put a realistic torso, eyes and legs on sonic let me be so dramatic about it"""
gaming,My 5 year old is a Sonic fanatic and she is absolutely thrilled it’s coming out. I’m happy for her to be able to go to the movies to see something she enjoys!
gaming,Look how they massacred my boy.
gaming,"Wow dude you nailed this, nice job!"
gaming,"I would like to see it too. The meow line was hilarious. This is obviously a comedy not the godfather.

How else would you make a movie about a blue speeding hedgehog? But hey lets virtue signal about how much we hate it"
gaming,you really hoped for it?
gaming,Thank you for the insight.
gaming,Mario Bros has a bizarre sense of imagination and creativity that it really becomes entertaining but not the way the directors intended.
gaming,Urf perma burnouts even long term players making them lose a lot of players. That's the reason they're not making it available so often and especially not in the old form.
gaming,Don't swap it or use your knife?
gaming,Ciri in underwear tho
gaming,I think minecraft came free with every tablet and copy of windows I've bought in the last decade.. I played it when it was just some free beta game like a decade ago.. is it still free? I haven't played since before its release
gaming,I will be playing it on a in browser emu site then Thank you for that name.
gaming,Finally! C’mon guys this was way too far down.
gaming,"Step 1: Draw a circle

Step 2: Draw the rest of the sanic"
gaming,Someone call Kevin Bacon!
gaming,I think that’s the positive to all of this. It’s amazing at the number of people who think this is not a kids movie.
gaming,At least we can both finally agree on something!
gaming,"Yes! I thought it was, but I was thinking of tonics and not vigors. Ot was on the tip of my tongue, thanks for the help."
gaming,"Usually yes. A 1 minute trailer can make a crappy movie look good. But if they don't even have enough good content to make a good 1 minute trailer, then you know it's going to be crappy."
gaming,"That moment a bunch of adults are upset bc they don’t like the production of a kids movie.

Yeah I grew up in the games too but it’s a kids movie... grow up.."
gaming,Everything about you is way more pathetic than a fat slob at McDonald’s
gaming,This sonic needs to be killed with fire ASAP.
gaming,You should really check out Visage via Steam.
gaming,Pictured: every League player ever
gaming,That 130 horizontal FOV.
gaming,It would probably do worse than just the head
gaming,I agree. It’s a problem in Hollywood in general. Movies and tv show writers always rely on jump scares.
gaming,The VA were paid for their work at the time. Why would they get paid again for the Remaster? All the voice work is already done.
gaming,"So this isn't true. Gamestop did a test with Days Gone. It was a if you didn't like the game within 48 hours of the games released you could return it for $59.99 in store credit. Meaning you had two days return it from the day it releases and that's it. And that was ONLY with Days Gone thus far. Now, if we have a pre owned copy of a game I always recommend the preowned copy to customers just in case they don't like it they have 7 days to return it for their money back. That's why pre owned, as a gamer, is better honestly."
gaming,Yeah and about knack 2 as well
gaming,The Outlast games where pretty scary
gaming,"THIS. It's a kids movie about a video game character who doesn't adhere to the laws of physics. why are people trying to break down every aspect. it's also made by the producers of fast and furious, so people shouldn't be surprised"
gaming,Wow way to spoil the movie for me :(
gaming,Well so much for sleep...
gaming,Import Tuner Challenge (XBOX 360)
gaming,ITS A FURRY! RUUUNNN!
gaming,All we asked for was Sonic Adventure 3. Why can’t you just give us Sonic Adventure 3
gaming,"&gt;""I cant handle these more difficult mechanics...""

&gt;""Okay thats cool, just don't say it feels wrong""

&gt;""Dont gatekeep me REEEEEEEEEEE""

Dota is an objectively more complex and difficult game, you absolute buffoon. No one is ""gatekeeping you."""
gaming,He probably got farted on
gaming,It auto starts you with the primary so swapping it to the pistol is a must and I didn’t do any melee attacks
gaming,"They already did! And if you stretch the definition, there's been 2 good sonic movies made. There's the old OVA anime from back in the day which isn't exactly great, but it's passable and has a very good artstyle ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic\_the\_Hedgehog\_(OVA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(OVA)) ), and there's a very well animated 3d short that was released after sonic unleashed, which I'd say is a great short for kids, like something out of scooby doo. ([https://youtu.be/E8JBMgrsN8M](https://youtu.be/E8JBMgrsN8M))"
gaming,I said this first! XD
gaming,"Fair enough. In my small circle, everyone is wetting themselves over Detective Pikachu. And just for the record I am not saying Sonic looks good here. Just I realize what they were going for, and I can recognize it as the character."
gaming,I don’t think I’ve ever laughed so hard so quickly
gaming,There is generally more than one movie aimed at children at a time.
gaming,He’s right you know...
gaming,"Played it. Whilst it is scary and effective, I preferred Contemp which was basically the same game but done better"
gaming,"Makes sense, but then why not just make a new ip?"
gaming,Holy crap! I was literally just thinking this today!
gaming,"Thats dunkeys car, guys!1!!!!"
gaming,Why is everyone shocked that the movie looks terrible? Its Sonic the Fucking Hedgehog!
gaming,"I dunno man, what on earth would the plot be?"
gaming,Well his more Robotnik looking appearance at the end still looks like Jim Carrey so they could just have him look like Robotnik and still get his face.
gaming,"so from what ive been hearing rumor wise, sony is actually talking about letting people who buy digtial games on their new system, for them to be able to ""trade it back to sony for store credit like gamestop does"". but i still want the option to be able to buy hard copies of any game, less downloading and more installing"
gaming,"Right, but in reality it's worse than that. They constantly make changes *for the sake of making changes*. Champion reworks abound."
gaming,"I haven't played LoL in a long time, what's Urf?"
gaming,this post is legendary.
gaming,"Charlie Brown, Winnie The Pooh's Springtime With Roo, Yogi The Easter Bear, some Bugs Bunny stuff, some horror films for some reason, some generic Easter Bunny stuff, and a lot of religious ones.

So yes!"
gaming,I have a feeling they know it's bad and are counting on people to go watch it to see how bad it is.
gaming,Is that how he lost his 2 fingers?
gaming,you forgot to hit enter between Jumanji and artist... just saying.
gaming,"The plot involves eggman trying to get the chaos emeralds from Johnny's apartment in San Francisco, but his vampire ghost proves a challenge so be tricks Knuckles into playing football against Johnny and when Johnny gets shin splints eggman seizes the emeralds. This is interjected with clips of sonic and tails increasingly messily eating chili dogs, until it just gets strangely erotic. The film ends with Johnny's soul departing after proclaiming again he is fed up with the wrold."
gaming,The hero we need but don't deserve.
gaming,Are you mad because you got called out for being a creepy old dude?
gaming,come play dota2 a game that's designed for experienced players instead of new players. it gets more fun the longer you play instead of the opposite way around...
gaming,Don’t insult the monkey kid like that!
gaming,Play it again. That game aged poorly.
gaming,"it isn't the next gen wtf, it's just a xbox but cheaper because no disc drive, xbox one s all digital or something"
gaming,zac effron got old.
gaming,"I'm waiting for Jinx, Mr Mime already looks horrifying"
gaming,Thanks for this btw
gaming,My FOV is 90.
gaming,"Honestly, the most probable answer to this is that fear isnt universal, but jumpscares trigger a fight or flight response which is pretty guaranteed for the most part.
Qe hate stupid jump scares because they get us and we feel dumb for being got, but actual fear is difficult to do in a way that an investor might be willing to back.
Most things, especially with horror, almost always cycle back around to money sadly"
gaming,"Look at his face, now look at a furry suit, his face, now a furry fur suit, now you know this movies audience. Terrifying."
gaming,"Ah, I see you are an individual of culture as well..."
gaming,Also a semi cyclops
gaming,I’ll take Flo from progressive over Dr. Robotcarey
gaming,"It’s better but it’s also much worse. I’ve stopped playing on my main (D2) because it’s just a shitfest with RU / TR / EUNE imports with high MMR but no brains filling up the teams. If that happens the game is coin flip. I don’t like coin flip.  
Meanwhile on a fresh account I’m playing fellow diamonds in gold, cause they all feel the same.  
Diamond+ is sprinkled with low elo, sub diamond is sprinkled with medium to high elo.  
  
Oh and another tank meta is arising. Just that this time tanks do _even more damage,_ just like they should. Right?  
^(fuck this why am I still here)"
gaming,Well this is how most people reacted to Detective Pikachu at first so
gaming,It's a Furry's wet dream
gaming,JUUUUUDY. ITS ME PEEEETER
gaming,This movie looks so bad not even Jim Carey can carry this movie
gaming,"DotA &gt; league, only children play League"
gaming,"I'm just super happy the title didn't end with ""fam""."
gaming,"nah

once a game comes out that has a real competitiveness to it and isnt a BR that dies in a month, league will die out.

theyre the result of valve handling dota even worse and there being zero competition. most high elo players like myself dont even care for the game, but like climbing the ladder."
gaming,"As a league player, can confirm"
gaming,Lmao guess I'll stay away if everyone there is as toxic as you are.
gaming,"Me failing out of college due to World of Warcraft would tend to prove the opposite. 

Sorry no help to you."
gaming,"It’s his eyes and smirk that’s really missing. Still. I’d watch this movie. Jim Carrey is hilarious. And I have A-List, so not like I’m wasting money if I watch it."
gaming,"Jesus Christ, can you swing any slower?"
gaming,"I JUST NOTICED THE DAMN NIKE SHOES!
EVERY THING IS AN AD PLACEMENT NOW ISNT IT?"
gaming,You could add Enchanted to this as well since he talked to a squirrel in that one
gaming,All I see is moltres
gaming,What's the scar from?
gaming,"They didn’t even put human teeth in The Who’s in Whoville, come on guys! He’s a hedgehog!!"
gaming,I think he's cute... In an inbred disgusting kind of way...
gaming,This makes me sad
gaming,"I don't get the gloves either, but it still looks cool. It's just a design choice, and I think it works."
gaming,Joey?  Please dont tell them about the boxers incident. You told me you would keep quiet.
gaming,Played season 2-7.  I don't have a PC anymore else I'd try at least.  It's the best of times the worst of times.  I can see myself getting into it post college
gaming,Cereal without milk vs cereal with milk
gaming,I will be keeping an eye out in the end credits
gaming,"Ultra Ralid Fire

Unlimited mana with very short CD spells"
gaming,They need to be hit with the gun first right?  I think the Flash could take out whomever before they could even pull the trigger.  Plus you can see Snark following him leading his shot with the gun in some episodes.  I'm like there is no fucking way.
gaming,"I don't know why people keep saying this.  
   
1) he looks nothing like the character.  
  
2) he sounds completely different.  
  
Its like, just slapping a coat of blue paint on a short, round person doesn't make him a good sonic."
gaming,Don’t even put them side by side. Criminal.
gaming,I suppose I'll have to check it out then. I feel like I just got counterspelled.
gaming,"Is it true that there's a place in a man's head that if you shoot it, it will blow up?"
gaming,"Designed that way on purpose. League was designed to be ez for new players and casuals to pick up, which is why it has no depth and is ultimately shit.

The turn rates, attack animations, projectile travel speeds, deny mechanic, they are all balancing factors that play into high level DotA and make it a complex interplay like a fighting game."
gaming,"No. It’s absolutely not safe to say that. Someone clearly has never heard the expression, “never judge a book by its cover.”"
gaming,I wasn’t talking about the can ones but honestly I thought this tops were pretty ingenious. Never had this jizz in my lap problem you’re experiencing. There’s a 1 and a half year old running around me and he’s gotten his hand on it and not a drop was spilt.
gaming,"The good parent move is taking your kid to see a good movie, not a shitty one.

Frozen 2

gaming,Think I reverse nutted
gaming,Handmade? You want to tell me these things are usually made by machines?
gaming,Praise the lord potato
gaming,Umm. Can I die now?
gaming,"I personally feel the snarky ""too cool"" attitude is outdated, and what makes Sonic nowadays a bland character"
gaming,"You say tomater, I say dermatermorts."
gaming,"Doesn't look like it, maybe 90 vertical which is like 120ish in 16:9. I haven't played the game though so I don't know, just poking fun."
gaming,I mean the bee movie has been quite prolific in memes
gaming,"I have to say,if they redesigned Sonic from scratch, the movie would probably be passable.  Jim Carrey as a 90's super villain was a good call."
gaming,Well it's mostly in ranked that that happens but it can happen in normals. Just sucks when a teammate dies 7 times in a row to the same enemy making him unbeatable
gaming,Too bad they cant erase sonic in the post production
gaming,My son is fucking terrified.
gaming,If they had just kept his video game look I think it wouldnt be that bad. I dont really expect amazing movies when the make them from video games but his look was the easiest thing to have.
gaming,"Probably skip the shower, and microwave some pizza rolls/hot pocket."
gaming,"&gt;Champs with shit taste in *soda* sure.

gaming,will watch just for the eggman origin story
gaming,"I call it soda, pop, soda pop, and on the rare occasion, coke. Without looking at my user history, where do I live?"
gaming,"Yeah, humans were mostly killed off by Squid Aliens that also ""killed"" Sonic  for a while when they (the aliens) came back. Also WWI happened again, but with animals, and Robotnik helped the good guys in it in order to gain power."
gaming,"Pop? What are you, 4 years old? Its soda dang nabbit!"
gaming,"I wasn’t implying Fortnite was cringey itself, I enjoyed during the beginning seasons. I meant that kids the go around and do fortnite dances and shit. I agree, Minecraft is fucking amazing, it’s gonna have the biggest comeback of 2019 and it’s already started"
gaming,Awesome I just played through this game for the first time a few months ago loved it except for lizard tails if I made cover art it would be toonces the driving cat knocking tails off lizards
gaming,"The shoes, I get. The eyes though, they should have been bigger."
gaming,"I think you might be misunderstanding me. I was not talking about M rated games. If you’re into that and you say it’s adult then ok that’s fine. 

I am saying Sonic is for kids. 

It’s not being directed at adults. It’s being directed at kids. And a little kid is not going to look at that and go. “Lame design. It’s so derivative. It doesn’t honor the original Sega design.”

A little kid who likes Sonic is going to look at that and be so excited."
gaming,still salty i see
gaming,WHAT IN GOD’S NAME IS WRONG WITH YOU
gaming,"Strange, I played it about 3 or 4 times. People were super toxic. Uninstalled the game, never played again. It's the only game I've ever quit playing because of toxic players. Worse, why was I being matched with super experienced players as a brand new player and why were experienced players bitching about noob players while playing on smurfed accounts? I'll never know but it seemed neat."
gaming,Lol. No one says tomato.
gaming,"I'm from southern California, the other day I had a fast food employee ask me if I wanted a pop with my food, and she immediately blushed bright red and apologized, ""I'm sorry, I'm so Midwestern, how lame."""
gaming,People are hating on this Sonic movie....get the fuck over it. Get a life.
gaming,I was meaning the one from back during I think it was Halo 3 days before they went with two flavors for WoW. I think the horde red was the same flavor as the one I’m talking about. It was like a blend of Livewire and Code Red
gaming,Apply ointment to burn area.
gaming,"If you're gonna do a jump scare, at least do so after 1-2 false scares. Example, you hear a noise. You go investigate in the basement. The door slams. You open the door. You see a shadow at the top of the stairs. You go investigate what it is like the dumb fuck you are. You find it's a door that's slightly ajar. You look to your right and see a figure of a woman standing in the corridor. You walk over to her to get a closer look. She's a mannequin. You turn around and a ghost jump scares you."
gaming,Wait ryan reynolds is playing Red?
gaming,Who else used to/still plays league?
gaming,Man I wish cognac was more common in the US
gaming,Hey you found Dunkey
gaming,I got good expectations :)
gaming,Sonic games aren’t all that great either
gaming,"I'll take a stab at it:

Both movies have inhuman CGI creatures from video games.  Detective Pikachu, however, puts them in a world that is drenched in neon, full of unfamiliar brands and advertisements, and clearly incorporates them into its identity. Being distinctly not ""our"" Earth helps to accept the strangeness of Ludicolo's fur and walleyed stare, or Machamp's really weird lips.

Sonic puts... Sonic into a grounded reality that is visually indistinguishable from ""our"" Earth, specifically as a fish out of water. Literally everything around him conforms to what we expect to see, making his design and musculature and animation stand out as jarring and ""wrong"" that much more."
gaming,Lol. That's hilarious 😂😂
gaming,How can people be super hyped for detective pikachu but crap on this one?? I’m much more excited for sonic over Pokémon...
gaming,By far a much less abuse prone set of mechanics though.  Chivalry had serious problems with its backwards swinging and near uncounterable swing types.
gaming,What a fucking dumb design lol.
gaming,This movie isn’t even out yet and it already flopped
gaming,"It’s all good, I honestly have no idea if the FOV setting in game is horizontal or vertical, I just set it to 90, doesn’t look weird to me and I hate really wide FOV’s, might be the video idk."
gaming,*curb your enthusiasm theme intensifies*
gaming,"What social media sites was he deplatted from?  And why should companies not have the right to ban who they want for whatever reason if he had been deplatted?   He is free to start his own social media site if that's the case.  And all that I said just now has been the right wing anti-gov intervention talking points I grew up hearing.  What is your solution to these companies deplatforming that does not involve government action?   Maybe if we cut their taxes some more that will show them?  ROFL.  Wasn't the Left that established the corporate overlords buddy.  Look at what side of the isle made corporations ""people"" in the first place.  And even the God Emperor himself in a Breitbart interview said he was not going to break up any company or do anything about deplatforming.  So go whine to someone who cares about chud crap backfiring on themselves LOL"
gaming,how did nobody in production come up with this along the way lmao.
gaming,Every league player even though they play it every day

gaming,"I don't think it even looks that bad, the worst part is really having Jim Carey in it. He needs to stop acting."
gaming,I choose the first option. Just know that I only fight naked. And fully erect.
gaming,It's because the military will loan out equipment for filming if you make them look good. Free budget!
gaming,"Triss I think is a nicer person by Witcher 3 but in the first game she hides Geralt past from him and casts magic on him to make him love her, which is pretty rapey."
gaming,Is there just a personality type League appeals to that *always* has to be right??
gaming,Youre thinking of Dank Souls.
gaming,Still had to pay for the game tho. Pay to win has always existed.
gaming,"&gt;oh no, ~~a kids movie that didn't think about the grown ups~~ a movie made by corporate hacks :(

gaming,"Why the FUCK would they make him so humanlike? It would be ok if he had long legs, big hands, and big feet. That's it"
gaming,"I give passes to one type of jump scare and that is if the character is scared with us.
If it's just for the audience, I'm probably going to be annoyed"

gaming,meme made by dota 2 gang
gaming,Why was it set to Gangstas Paradise?!
gaming,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think the producers of his particular film opted for more of an anthropomorphic appearance for Sonic, in order to appeal to a greater audience.  An older audience might be unwilling to watch a film that looks like it’s directed towards a much younger demographic.  

What do you think ? 

I wonder if Tails, or Knuckles will be in this film.....

I remember playing that Sonic surfers or something game on Game-Cube, back in the day.  This film is long overdue.  I’m excited."
gaming,Mine got sold by my parents they are dicks
gaming,"Jinco, like the jeans he likes"
gaming,"me: *smashes keyboard* ""GOD FUCKING DAMMIT, I FUCKING HATE THIS FUCKING GAME!""

wife: ""why play it if you're not having fun?""

me: ""i **AM** having fun, FUCK!"""
gaming,"The achievement is broken. To get it close the game, hard restart your console and play a offline game right away after reboot. Don’t pick anything up and don’t run out of ammo and you should get it. It’s broken because of the weapon xp glitch that should be patched next update."
gaming,"Bet you 10:1 that they did it so he could operate ""human stuff"" like guns and door handles. Easier to film and mocap"
gaming,You would be correct!! I hope this post gets more up votes like that's worth it lol
gaming,Anyone else cringed out by the fact that he's wearing Nike shoes?

gaming,I disagree strongly. Sure they are shaped the same and everything but the texture is weird. It doesn't look realistic to me. They don't look natural. It reminds me of the way Howard the Duck looks and it's really off-putting. But hey maybe I'm the only one
gaming,Love the Nike shoe's

gaming,"Don't, the game had its high point back in season 4 and it hasn't been as good ever since. Its gotten a bit better in the last couple of months so it might reach its old glory days again but i highly doubt it.

They just fucked it up with all of the dumb shit they added into it. Not that that's stopping me from still playing it, shit is like crack to me."
gaming,Sonic is fast but ~~Big Bird~~ the bullet was faster
gaming,What's the easiest way to tell if someone is a Dota player? The fact that they can't stop talking about League of Legends!

gaming,"They upgraded to gamecubes at some point, i only know because i found the corpse of a gamecube one at a mcplay place"
gaming,"Fuck, that's what was getting at me about the trailer. Sonic... just doesn't look like Sonic.

This movie has the potential to be so terrible that it's good, lol."
gaming,If a furry made him he would actually look like Sonic the hedgehog and not this mess. Just so you know.

Tell that to Detective Pikachu"

gaming,This car reminds Cobalt SS from NFSMW (2005)
gaming,"Wait... speaking of Tails, where the fuck is he in this trailer? Are they just leaving him out of the movie? Honestly, I was kind of waiting to see how they fucked him up."
gaming,[This trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA-4B2d4L18) is far superior to the current one.
gaming,yeah they're gonna need more than gloves to salvage that mess.
gaming,Runs better than the games we got coming out now for crying out loud.
gaming,The '06 developers were also suffering under the curse of a vengeful witch. Rumor has it the same one responsible for E.T.
gaming,"""Can't reveal testing numbers""? What, are you an employee? Because I'll be honest, I have trouble believing kids liked this. It just looks boring, bad, and gross. I don't think I'd like it as a kid, plus most kids nowadays are on the internet; I'm sure a bunch of them have seen how other's are bashing this movie."
gaming,"I still have it, my Dreamcast on the other hand didn’t hold up so well"
gaming,"Yeah. I usually play with 100 horizontal or 68 vertical, it can be hard to tell in some games. It always looks weird to me when I see people playing with really high FOVs, but it's just a matter of personal preference. This game looks neat though, thanks for turning me on to it."
gaming,"Every time they change some stupid shit in League i think to myself that i will start playing Dota again. Then i load into a game and my chat starts filling up with ""CYKA BLYAT"" and i remember why i haven't played it in so long."

gaming,"This is the same thing everyone kept saying about wow during the mmo boom, yet it's still top dog. It didn't matter how much better some games were, or how pretty, or in what IP, because wow had everyone already invested in it. 

Some games are just gonna be here till the companies decide to pull the plug due to the level of investment in them from players. 

Just like wow people have excessive amounts of money dumped into the game and that's very hard to walk away from."
gaming,This is going to be a bigger insult than  Garfield: The Movie.
gaming,"Reminds me of wolf sonic, dunno why."
gaming,"I like it when I feel like the game is doing a bit of psychological fuckery with me. Another Silent Hill example. In the original you walk into a room you've already been in before to find there's now a fence blocking the corridor that wasn't there before. This is also cognitive dissonance. You now only have two options. The male and female toilets. You walk into the toilets. Then you walk out to find nothing happened. You're still trapped. You walk back into the toilets since it's your only option. Something about the toilets feels different. You walk back out. Still trapped. You walk back into the toilets, the toilets are now covered in blood and gore and you find a shotgun. You walk back out and find the gate has gone and you're free"

gaming,"I remember play a vs bot game.  Most people were on the same page.  About three of us wanted to experiment, try a new champ or test the timing/feasibility of certain plays and synergies.

Other guy didn’t give af and was just burning time grinding points vs ai.  This other guy though was in it to win it.

Was screeching at us about lanes and item comps and when to push.  

About 15-20 min in one of us finally says “You realize that this is a bot game and that the only person here trying at all is you?”

Screeching continues.  So we all return to shop and watch him lose the bots.

He claimed to report us, so we are in turn report him except we have chat logs.

Dunno if anything came if that but it was damn funny seeing this guy lose his shit on a vs bots game"

gaming,If you watch most of the big league streamers they get so pissed at their teammates at the drop of a hat.
gaming,"There is no tank meta, I have no idea why people keep claiming that. Riot is trying to gently nudge more tanks into soloQ and proplay, and that’s hard. And they’re doing an okay job right now. Who’s running rampant? Sion? Yea, not anymore."
gaming,THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES
gaming,"DotA players do have a fetish for talking shit about League but to say that no League player ever mentions DotA is kinda ridiculous considering that in every major post calling out Riot being incompetent, you will always see DotA being brought up. Also considering that a lot of OG league players played DotA, it’s not unusual to see it being brought up not even counting the creation of threads that mention DotA around every week."
gaming,"Yes and no. Mundo changes, Cho, Garen.. Tanks are coming. This trend seems to continue, and soon enough.. I’m starting to learn other lanes. I need to get out of toplane. I don’t want to be there anymore. Shits boring and annoying. My one trick / semi-main was utterly gutted for no reason anyways so I don’t have much to lose anymore ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

gaming,"You know what I want a middle opinion, not fully real but not fully like the games."
gaming,where can I buy this sticker?
gaming,They should bury every copy of this movie in the desert next to E.T.
gaming,As someone whose stoped playing LoL I couldn't agree more. RIP to all those players who are addicted to that shit game and can't quit.
gaming,"Nice work, hope they make paper.io 3 where’s it’s against actual human players."
gaming,"Think about it this way, video gaming is, like it or not, a young person thing. If we're pushing mid-20s or older, we are old in comparison to the community.

You need maturity to accept responsibility for your actions, you also need maturity to accept that you might not be correct or, GOD FORBID, you're actually just wrong. It's a foreign concept to a lot of people."

gaming,Yeah but all the profits are in sanic bux.
gaming,"If anything Detective Pikachu has taught us is that it's just best to embrace the original designs! Sonic looks so weird, like he had a few too many plastic surgeries that all went horribly wrong."

gaming,Hollywood... That's how. These are the same idiots who cast Topher Grace as Eddie Brock...
gaming,Damn even that looks better lol.
gaming,What game is this?
gaming,I'm totally going to watch this movie.
gaming,He's naked if this is supposed to be realistic where is his animal dog sucked in penis hole or whatever they have . Also were is his asshole.
gaming,I'd say it's more of How Sega Killed Sonic. But that story has been playing out for decades.
gaming,That's a badass tattoo
gaming,Sequel bait. Just like insane robotnik
gaming,Jim Carrey is the worst.
gaming,So that’s why Robin killed himself. Damn you live action Sonic.
gaming,"Sonic would have looked better if he'd been a literal blue hedgehog instead of this bizarre monstrosity where they tried to copy the game version, but changed a lot of shit. They should have just made a CG version of the video game character if they were going to go with live action."
gaming,Thing 1 and Thing 2
gaming,I wish that gun fired actual ballets rather than tranquilizers
gaming,Oh Jesus Christ roll a 6 and send that thing back in
gaming,"This is my guess as well.


In the comics, Sonic apparently reaches the Sonic Boom at 760mph, the same speed on the cop's speed gun [in the trailer](https://youtu.be/FvvZaBf9QQI).

https://blog.vrv.co/aitchison/3952/reading-the-old-testament-of-sonic-the-hedgehog/

The comics is based on the origin story of ""The Sonic Bible"" created by Sega of America. I guess Sega of America is the one behind the movie.

Maybe this is why we are seeing a shitty Sonic and (hopefully) he will turn into a good looking Sonic just like [Jim Carrey turns into a fat bald Eggman](https://i.imgur.com/Bp9rKYA.png)."
gaming,"Pokemon TV show should've been called ""Ash Ketchum"" then"
gaming,They damn well better have the goggles though
gaming,I grew up on the Mario movie and thought as a grown man it can't be worse than that.
gaming,Changed his fucking shoes just for the nike sponsorship
gaming,"It's easier to stop when you realize that  you aren't playing League, and League is playing you.

There is an opportunity cost for every second you spend, spending time on league at the cost of job, love, or family is a terrible opportunity lost. Dattebayo"
gaming,"So basically the bar is really *really* low, when you use the words ""pretty good easter movie"""
gaming,Found the dota player
gaming,Yeah...shame too. Since Sonic was once a great franchise.
gaming,"I'm not sure negative attention is so good for a movie tho.

You could've told me they are making a sonic movie with Jim Carey and ide have been happy.  But after seeing this mutant that sonic has been turned into...  I dunno"
gaming,THIS IS EXACTLY WHO I THOUGHT OF WHEN I SAW THE NEW SONIC lmaooooo
gaming,"Which light do you wield, guardian?"

gaming,Now he can suck two dicks.
gaming,"&gt; Netflix passed on Holmes and Watson because of how garbage it was

gaming,'Laugh and grow fat!'

Luckily they never would touch any of my stuff :). 

But feels bad man :(. Hope you get some of the stuff you lost back!"

gaming,Turn off the volume and play the original MK Movie theme song in a different tab.  100 times better
gaming,The one's on GameCube still hold up good imo...

gaming,Aww you stole this joke from the other guy in Reddit ☹️ Give him credit?
gaming,Freaked the hell out seeing first 10 secs
gaming,Not really deep cut when it's one of the most quoted lines from the movie
gaming,"I sucked at bloodborne, so im being biased when I say HZD. Will give BB another shot again some day."
gaming,This is also a book thing only briefly touched on in the games. Most sorceresses grew up as ugly girls who used magic to get hot but Yennifer was a cleft-lipped hunchback who was basically treated like garbage her entire life and is bitter that she only got treated like a human being after the equivalent of millions in plastic surgery.
gaming,"Here's he full Robotnik

gaming,I like the 3D
gaming,The problem is that he has 2 eyes. Real sonic has one
gaming,"Jim Carrey will do a great Eggman I think.

It’s too bad I won’t be seeing the movie. This render of Sonic is going to give me nightmares. They *really* missed the mark with that."
gaming,"Man i've been playing League for 8 years now. Im basically numb to flaming, i just prefer my teammates to at least speak English."

gaming,You still have to eat and drink
gaming,This will bomb too hard for a sequel
gaming,"Well, it's got Jim Carrey at least. Man, Jim... how the mighty have fallen."
gaming,"I think it’s the video, doesn’t look that bad in game, FOV can be adjusted anyway."
gaming,"It's definitely part of the meme. The kid spelled it wrong, so there's a world of hurt waiting for the person who says it with ""personal"" and you'll have an inbox full of corrections and copypasta insults."
gaming,"Everyone is complaining that he doesn't look like Robotnik, clearly this is still Dr. Kintober and the shot at the end where he's bald is Robotnik"
gaming,Was the decal made for the controller?
gaming,"The McDonald’s I usually went to before I both grew out of and finally realized what McDonald’s food actually was, had gamecubes, I think one was a Metroid game (never had a GameCube and never played a Metroid game so I’m not sure if that is wrong) Luigi’s mansion, and I think maybe a Mario party. not the same since my first non-handheld console ever was the Wii, but still equally nostalgic for me non the less"
gaming,Did somebody roll a 5 or a H8
gaming,"Good Game is toxic?  What's the polite thing to say, suck your mum?"
gaming,"Growing up watching this movie, I want this to become a new meme format."

gaming,On the pain index or on how good it is?
gaming,The same brave souls who sort by new.
gaming,"Seriously, it's just a childrens movie. And it doesn't even look that bad."

gaming,"Bloodborne. Horizon is also great, maybe get it later :)"
gaming,If you look at it upside down it looks dozens of times better
gaming,"I dont find it easy by any means. More simple sure, but it's not easy. I am sure I could destroy you in league regardless of how good at Dota you are, and that is because there are complexities to league that make it different, that comes from practice and just general in game knowledge.  Different games appeal to different people. I really enjoy the game, sorry you dont. You can either agree to disagree or be a dick like the other guy."
gaming,So what big whoop wanna fight about it?
gaming,Yes that is what I meant.
gaming,I thoroughly enjoyed playing IV!
gaming,"Full name Miles ""Tails"" Prower"
gaming,I won't actually sit down to and watch the movie.  I'll watch it frame by frame in meme infinity.
gaming,I honestly don’t understand what everyone expected to see...
gaming,"Eh, just thought it'd make a funny meme."
gaming,I like it without the weird uni-eye but then again I only recently started fucking furries
gaming,"I mean the personality is a pretty big part of a character. If you change Sonic’s personality and attitude it’s not really Sonic anymore, because you may as well just reskin the entire movie with characters that look completely different and it wouldn’t matter."
gaming,It was good just the ds had to exist (ds is the best handheld)

gaming,"You don’t ban yasuo from the enemy team, you hand him from your team."
gaming,It's been at the top of /r/gaming and other trash subreddits at least 4-5 times. Google it.
gaming,"now ive seen the whole thing, i don't think it's that bad 

they were clearly going for a more realistic interpretation. this is probably what a child-sized blue hedgehog would look like. the ""normal"" sonic would look absurd. people should expect that whenever there's a realistic, live action adaptation of their favourite cartoons, it's probably not going to look like it does in the cartoons. like the TMNT movie etc.

movie still looks garbage tho."
gaming,"Let me show you something...

&gt;Just because you put this little reference bar on the left like you were quoting the conversation doesn't mean that's how it actually happened.

The rest of us can read too.

You're mischaracterizing the convo. Honestly the guy just said those things in particular didn't appeal to him. He really didn't insult the game, just said that it wasn't his cup of tea. Then the response was super sanctimonious and is now deleted for downvotes. 

When the guy responded to it saying that it was just clunky to him, then you react to his comment with this... whatever the hell this is. It's a gross misquotation of the conversation. There was no reeeeing. There was no insulting the game. It was just a description of subjective experience, not an objective put down. Get out of here with your name-calling (absolute buffoon? for what?) self, gatekeeping these people because they don't like the same games as you."
gaming,Not like this. Not like this.
gaming,"Detective Pikachu is already making me question that style of animation for bringing a character to life. And Detective Pikachu is an example of the technique being done right.

gaming,"Being ""too cool"" is literally his brand. It's why he has such a big marketing history outside of merchandise. Would middle schoolers with a few bucks be inclined to pick up something branded with ""too cool"" sonic or ""chill"" sonic? Sonic is a brand image that channels the angsty rebellious adolescents into something fun. ""Too cool"" isnt just a persona given by the story and games, it's a persona for the fanbase its marketed towards."
gaming,"Yeah I never talk about lol, why would i? I even played it to lvl 30, got bored, returned to Dota and never mentioned it again. It just wasn’t as exciting of a game so i moved on and never looked back. I imagine that’s what most Dota first players experience was like."

gaming,Do you like ham and eggs? Or are you an egg bro that’s calling me ham?
gaming,I’m fine with no disc as long as the memory storage space on the console can handle more than 4 games.
gaming,"Fallout 3, NV, and 4 are like apples that are each a slightly different shade of red.  Watching people fight to the death about which shade of slightly different red is SO MUCH BETTER than another slightly different shade of red is hilarious."
gaming,You leave Peter Sheperd alone! His parents died!
gaming,"Director: ""One note - make sure he has like a full set of baby teeth, all incisors, visible as often as possible"""
gaming,"Yes, he was a lolcow named blood_skull_boi84...and he was beautiful."
gaming,Looks to me like someone took one of the live action Ninja Turtles and put blue hair all over them.
gaming,The fave doesn't bug me so much as the body. Wtf we're they thinking?! I hated Sonic already and even I'm offended.
gaming,"Played for 7 years, dropped it cold turkey about 4 years ago. Haven't looked back a single time. I do miss me some Dominion matches though."
gaming,Sega hates sonics design in this movie
gaming,"...? What alternate reality did you grow up in?

I can see what they're going for sure but... you honestly recall sonic looking like a Who from the grinch movie and a weird blue I don't even know had an incest baby?

Is it recognizable as sonic? Yes. Does he look good at all? Subjective but I'd say the majority is right with not at all."
gaming,"This dude plays league.


When you're perfectly preserved in a briny salt why bother showering at all?"
gaming,"You know what's truly frightening about this movie?

&amp;#x200B;

If it makes any kind of profit at all...*there will be sequels.*"
gaming,Doesn’t game pass have all 3? Get 3 months for 1$ right now. Beat all 3. Unless you’re on ps4
gaming,"I thought the exact same thing, it’s the mouth animation, they are identical"
gaming,"Dude he is completely going to carry the movie from corner trash, to manageable"
gaming,just have to play LoL for a few games and you will know
gaming,This move looks like it was made by someone who has never played the game or watched a single episode of the TV show.
gaming,7 years is not long enough for you? Phones get a slightly upgraded model every year.
gaming,I think that the fall not the initial shot kills him?
gaming,Knuckles or maybe Shadow should be sequel bait. Tails should be in the first movie.
gaming,"I hated watching him and I want to punch him in the face, and that's what I like about his performance. I don't think the game or cartoon Eggman would translate well into a movie form, and Carey's performance works really well."
gaming,Have the Riot employees rioted yet?
gaming,Horizon is better. LOVE BB and dark souls but it can’t compare to horizons story and play style to me. The new game + and dlc kept me playing for a while
gaming,"You know, at first I was completely upset like everyone else, but the more I think about it I realize..stuff like this isn't made for me, and I have a feeling kids will eat this stuff up..lol, that's the target audience, not people like us..at least that's my opinion

EDIT: Wow, out of all of my posts I never expected this to be my first gold..lol"

The game is owned by the developers which is kind of cool, and the subreddit is /r/LastEpoch 

The game on release is I _believe_ $15, you can find all the supporter packs here and what you get: https://lastepochgame.com/supporters

The steam beta is $35, in line with the kickstarter goals, you get some extra stuff that release won't have."
gaming,"Yuck, not going to watch this."
gaming,Why hate on this movie? None of you can transition Sonic into a more realistic movie. Stop hating OP
gaming,"People's reaction to the Sonic film is kind of how I felt when I saw the trailer for Detective Pikachu the first time. Everyone around me was hyped as fuck and so ready for this movie, meanwhile I was... confused. I know it's a game, and I realise it's not trying to take itself seriously, but the 3D, overly detailed pokemon with the fur while still keeping the ""shape"" of the cartoon equivalents creeps me out. Hearing Ryan Reynolds' voice weirds me out, not that I consider him a bad actor, and I realise his voice being deep is deliberately part of the comedy, but it feels disjointed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I'll watch it I guess, but not in cinema. I felt apprehensive in a way that I couldn't describe, and when I saw the Sonic trailer, I understand why people hated it, but I also felt more at ease that they realise it's gonna be silly and just ride with it. /ramble"
gaming,Fumito Ueda(The dev of the game) would be proud.
gaming,This image makes me angry
gaming,you left out stoned
gaming,those aren't true fans then
gaming,"Absolutely not. Take a look at the Sonic from your childhood again. They are not the same, obviously. But they're not even remotely close. The only thing that I would consider close is the color scheme."
gaming,"It was super obvious to me, Tails always had that big dick energy about him."
gaming,Why does this look like Michael J Fox in a Russian tracksuit?
gaming,I wish that was the only thing of mine she sold
gaming,Stolen from erobb221 WeirdChamp
gaming,This went from semi-international to super american real quick
gaming,It looks like Dr. Seuss's Sonic the Hedgewho.

gaming,That Chevy clearly plays Dota2
gaming,"Idc if it’s been posted a million times. 

This is the best of Reddit. This is what Gets me though the day. It’s been a miserable day. One of my all time worst. 

Seeing that blue haired fuck when I loaded reddit immediately made me smile. I haven’t smiled in a while. 

I also loved both sonic and Jamunji  so much growing up which makes all of this even better. 

Thanks Spaceman.I hadn’t seen this joke/post yet.

Edit: a verse from the Bible I’ll always cherish. God or no God

“Their insults have broken my heart. And I am in despair. If only one person would show some pity; if only one would turn and comfort me”. Psalm 69 20

Today this blue cursed image was my comfort.(cursed because that sonic looks haunting to me)"
gaming,But the game's events didn't happen because they blew the god of time out of existence.
gaming,"It's both because people are stupid. But yes it is part of the meme. The original is *teleports behind you* ""nothing personnel kid"" as an example of high-order weebery.

But of course some people misspell it because they miss that part of the joke to begin with."
gaming,Pffff no microsoft will charge extra for that shit.
gaming,"So. Saaaaad.

Happy cake day!"
gaming,"Who knows, it might earn a lot of money just due to the ""so bad it's good"" effect. Though I highly doubt it as as much potential for this as Detective Pikachu"
gaming,it wasn't a funny one
gaming,"I used a walkthrough to end up with Yennefer because of the books, but if I do a NewGame+, I'm probably going to ""romance"" both of them so I end up tied to a bed and dumped by both of them.

Geralt ending up alone just sort of feels right."
gaming,People who are actually mad about this movie need to take a break from being online
gaming,So he fell to his death? I mean cool but this isn’t anything new tbh
gaming,Yes. Because no big company isnt spying on you. Ever
gaming,But he gained electric...porcupine quills?
gaming,Kevin Bacon voiced Knuckles.
gaming,"Of course there is.

King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters."
gaming,7 years is a long time for system life. Most technology In general is upped year to year. If you ever owned a gaming PC you find this kut the hard way by dumping 2k into and then have to marginally upgrade it after year 2.
gaming,"This gets posted a lot but what people tend to forget is that these are really in-depth, recreated models of trains. These aren't just simple re-skins and may have taken a ridiculous number of hours to make properly. Also, you aren't expected to buy them all like you might with map packs. You only buy the ones for the trains you want to use. It's the same thing as certain flight simulators that sell various models."
gaming,"Same.

Need a Nightmare/Sonic/Delerium crossover"
gaming,"At first, I saw nothing wrong with the new design, but as I keep at looking at it, it’s truly one big trash bag."
gaming,"I'd say Batman: Arkham Knight. To me, it's one of the greatest superhero games ever. But, it depends on which you'd prefer of course. All the games are totally different in style of gameplay."
gaming,Yeah all the dams’s were great
gaming,I really hope Sanic goes back to his home planet in this movie... And then is killed off-screen on his way there.
gaming,Why does a hedgehog have fur?
gaming,You hate it yet you play it. That is league of legends.
gaming,"Ha! Got 'em! That part about finger exercise was *especially* classic!

Just goes to show how abstaining from fast food not only makes you funny and clever, but also a pleasant and interesting person.

Whenever you're feeling down, just think back on this post and know that no matter what happens in life, you're better than fat people."
gaming,I played in those days as well but the terms have changed my friend our days of ToO are long gone
gaming,Ok I gotcha. What was your main? Was it akali? I'll only kinda judge you if it was akali.

Artist: ""sure thing!""

Everything ever."
gaming,Must be a DotA guy
gaming,"This movie is going to tell us how Robotnik fell into madness after trying to help millions of people, only to have his dream ruined by a foolish mutated hedgehog. This is already Oscar worthy."
gaming,He is the false shepherd leading us away from our flock
gaming,"True fans dont accept whatever is brought to them just cause it has the name____ attached to it. True fans can see the potential of quality content of what they are a fan of and will be upset when they see that potential wasted.

No different than a loving parent upset or disappointed when thier child ends up doing wrong. That doesnt mean the parents never loved them."
gaming,I said this to my friend earlier today and he didn’t see it. Glad someone else saw it
gaming,"Standard turn it off and back in again comment

Reboot routers

Then start diagnosing hardware.

It sounds like your router is going kaput, maybe check for software updates for it.

Hard to assess if this is computer or internet related based on info.

Edit- it doesnt sound computer related, however hard to rule it out based in provided info.

Try hardlining instead of wifi"
gaming,When did mount and blade get a graphical update?
gaming,"Literally can extend the splitting of an atom to appear like one hour has passed... gets punched by some old dude in a chair. Fuck, my blood pressure is rising already."
gaming,someone change the date pls
gaming,Why does sonic look like this? I feel bad for the person who had the final say on the design. It just doesn't feel true to everything we've ever seen of sonic.
gaming,My SO and I were just talking about this earlier!
gaming,"I like to watch when streamers get legitimately pissed at a difficult part in a game. Like ""wow what the fuck the hitboxes in this game suck ass"" after dying for the 30th time on a boss in Sekiro or something.

The fake yelling after 1 death isn't real rage."
gaming,"best childhood movie memory was when we were driving past our town movie theatre, and TMNT was playing.  I asked my mom if we could go see it, assuming she would say no.  She said yes, and I was just floored."
gaming,"A fucking masterpiece of marketing, that's what it is.

The art isn't in the movie. It's how a bad movie that knows it's bad has managed to get millions of people talking about it."
gaming,I’m glad someone finally gets it good job here’s an upvote for this
gaming,"Ok so I just watched the trailer and I think this movie is going to bamboozle us. One I agree this looks awful, but my theroy is that Sonic is in our world and need to go back to his world. Why I say that as see in the final shot of the trailer Dr Robonit looks cartoonie and the background looks  like Sonic's world from the games. I hope this is true (but in reality need this to be true)."
gaming,It's easier to just watch. I've caught pretty much every doublelift game for years.
gaming,It cannot heal my eyes from seeing that monstrosity.
gaming,"OH NO.....

#OH FUCKING NO"
gaming,"I mean, for everyone shitting on this trailer, I don't really get it. Like, as an early 30-something who grew up in a Sega household, I *totally* get the sense of ownership over Sonic the Hedgehog, but come on, it's a kid's movie. It's not *meant* for 30 year old adults, even if we wanna pretend it's ""just another nostalgia grab.""

Kids aren't gonna care if he looks exactly like the video game, or if the story is boring or not canon or whatever, like, it doesn't matter."
gaming,"Um, that was the joke that you ruined 😐"
gaming,"&gt;Every League of Legends player ever, including myself. We all hate the game, yet ~~we love it~~ we're addicted"
gaming,"Mind blown, kind of disappointed in myself considering Sonic 2 was the game of my childhood."
gaming,"But why did they fuck with Sonic at all? It's just WRONG.

It's gotta be the same team that made Michael Bay's Ninja Turtles."
gaming,what game is that?
gaming,He tried to cheat!
gaming,Its been 25 years since sonic was relevant. Get off the animation sucks bandwagon about something that was going to suck no matter what.
gaming,"Go back to Canada, Ohio."
gaming,Sonic adventure 2 for Dreamcast was
gaming,Thought I was there. /r/lostredditors
gaming,Okay to be fair soul games get the pass. Those games are just... oof.
gaming,"So are you an asshole all the time, or just on Tuesdays?"
gaming,Why did they decide to just color his hands white instead of giving him gloves
gaming,Just realized his hands are white fur 0\_0
gaming,"While I get this from an in-game perspective, does killing him or not make much difference in the story?"
gaming,His absolutely human mouth is difficult to look at.  Did they not see any Marvel films with Rocket?
gaming,"I stopped playing when dynamic queue came out. I’ve played one match of ARAM a while back with some friends but besides that, all of my time in this game was back in the good ol days."
gaming,"It's this one:

gaming,Yet in another scene in the same trailer he can apparently move so fast that time appears to stand still.  lmao
gaming,"As a midwesterner, I prefer it be called soda, as it should be. None of this ""pop"" or ""soda pop"" shit, and God forbid anybody just generically call any fizzy soda ""Coke"".

I'm joking obviously, but I do call it soda."
gaming,Not currently as far as I see
gaming,Still not watching this. What's with the hideous remakes of things lately.
gaming,And the green ranger
gaming,That isn't a question.
gaming,What I'm really tryin to say with this post.... IS THAT LEAGUE OF LEGENDS SUCKS DICK
gaming,I combined ops and the director's vision of this movie into an image for you. Came out like this https://imgur.com/gallery/W7jZWZD
gaming,Consoles hold gaming hardware and software back.
gaming,Agree. This is going to be the super Mario brothers/ double dragon of this decade.
gaming,There's an outside chance that this might have happened.  I remember Patton Oswalt talking about some director/producer who designed this huge robot spider that he really really wanted to use in a movie but didn't get to.  So he forced it into Wild Wild West the movie.  I might be messing up a few details of the story but it was from him on the WTF podcast
gaming,People are bugging out way too hard. I think he looks great for what and who he is. Get over it y'all.
gaming,Triss's sweetness was covering a veil of lies.  She deliberately withheld Geralt's own history so she could have him all to herself.
gaming,"Or Michigan. 

I'm from both and do all this."
gaming,"Who fucking cares if you haven’t seen it? Many people around here have been seeing it for years. And, you know this shit is supposed to be about OC, right? So yeah, sorry, the universe doesn’t revolve around you."
gaming,Can you imagine if movies or music were primarily distributed digitally?  The world would probably end.... oh wait nm.
gaming,"&gt;Designed that way on purpose. League was designed to be ez for new players and casuals to pick up, which is why it has no depth and is ultimately shit.

Chess, Carcasonne, Patchwork, Bang!, Rocket League, Risk, Town of Salem, the list could go on to infinity. You can explain any of those to any person in 3 minutes and get them playing, now tell me all of them are shit and have no depth.

&gt;The turn rates, attack animations, projectile travel speeds, deny mechanic, they are all ~~balancing factors~~ unnecessary convolution that play into high level DotA and make it a complex interplay like a fighting game.

Opinions man. Nothing wrong with liking DotA over LoL, but to glorify some mechanics as if a good MOBA game can't exist without them... The majority isn't always right, but holding the record of most played game in the world when the haters have been shouting ""ded game lul"" for years must mean something.

And complex is in no way a synonym of better, as I'll prove with an absurd example:

DotA2 7.0 patch notes:

- Breathing mechanic: heroes now have a separate ""oxygen consumption per second"" stat. You must press B to breathe in and N to breathe out at the correct intervals to keep them alive. Failure to do so will cause the ""suffocating"" abnormal status and drain 5% HP/s. Heroes who draw their oxygen from water will need to visit the river regularly before their HP runs out."
gaming,Because it’s in no one way whatsoever targeted to people who actually give a fuck about Sonic. It’s a movie that the grandparents can take their grandkids to.
gaming,"Nice try, Mr producer man"
gaming,"Fun fact, Ohio's only inhabitants are lizards and small mammals. All of the humanoid beings are actually the product of an intelligent AI's failed attempt to enslave humanity by producing wildly attractive, ultra realistic humanlike robots. Unfortunately for the AI, it's understanding of what makes humans attractive was hilariously misguided, thus spawning a whole state of goblin people who say weird shit like ""pop"" when they mean soda."
gaming,"They kick it to the curb and made it more for Business and educational use. Watch the KeyNote about HoloLens 2 went totally side ways as a gaming/ AR PC like they showed off on HoloLens 1

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure it will return to consumerism after people in the business field say ""oh, what if I can use this at home."""
gaming,"So you’re saying that the Sinking of the tanker and the big shell incident both occurred on this same day, which is the day in 1789 that George Washington was inaugurated? And it’s the first day rose and jack met?"
gaming,"All you raging basement dwellers need to relax, it's a Sonic, whose been irrelevant for 15 years."
gaming,Sick. I miss battlefield. Can’t wait for them to go back to modern era

gaming,Sonic Adventure 2 for
gaming,Oh you mean they could have made him look like Sonic?
gaming,"How does that stop me from seeing it, genius? I still see it before I click."
gaming,"Right! Im not mad because devs aren’t working hard enough. Im mad because i keep being sold games at full price that are missing content that is promised at launch. Publishers use advertising to over hype unfinished games then put it on the studios to fill in the gaps after launch and bare the brunt of gamers frustrations over the weak offering. 

Devs need more time to finish games on a deadline that makes sense for the scope of the game they are making. One year is fine for a sports game that recycles 70% of their assets whereas 2 years is not nearly enough for, say, BF5 where all new maps, weapons, mechanics and assets need to be made from scratch and any recycling is seen as a cheap work around."
gaming,Amazing game. Have fun!
gaming,Sonic adventure 2 for Dreamcast
gaming,"I mean he’s a hedgehog, they also have spines"
gaming,"&gt; agnolegdes

Eh do you perhaps mean 'acknowledges'?"
gaming,The new trailer for the Sonic movie came out. It looks... have I mentioned Jim Carrey is in it?
gaming,"Oh, cool. I was going by gut feeling, but it's kind of funny to have a leak already that backs up my guess. It feels like a studio would do; like how Jesse Eisenburg was bald as Lex Luthor in, like, the very last shot of Batman v Superman."
gaming,How do you like nine inch nails but hate Trent?
gaming,Have to include the [actual clip](https://youtu.be/FQDGgEP7vcc?t=87).
gaming,A river in a desert
gaming,Jumandi kid + X-men's beast
gaming,"He’s home, he’s just invisible and naked."
gaming,Sonic just looks like someone went up to a street artist at a festival and had them draw thier pet as a human.
gaming,"Explaining: 
His son died (i dont want share the reason) both father and son played together and i am feeling bad after this"
gaming,The movie is so bad its good.  The sonic movies only hope is for it to fall into the same criteria.
gaming,"Can you mail that to me, it’s for research"
gaming,Just looking at this my gooch hurts.
gaming,"What happened? Is this real? If so, Rest In Peace."
gaming,gg SOMETHING TOXIC AT THE END
gaming,Thank you for the input. Appreciate it.
gaming,Skate 2 was way better than skate 3
gaming,"What FPS games are you playing? Edit: looked through your post history, with those kinda games it's just practice, practice, practice. Just focus on one element of the games, dont worry about winning, dont worry about teammates, play solo games if possible, if playing with a team turn your voice chat down or mute them if possible. Focus on learning the weapon mechanics while standing still, moving, jumping and stuff like that. Itll take a lot of time to get better at anything especially video games. But your most likely going to have to focus on 1 game at a time until your comfortable with it before you switch between different games, if your constantly switching between games your going to be thrown off by the different game mechanics with each one and wont be able to get any better anytime soon."
gaming,Don’t worry legends never die
gaming,And that’s how Apex/Fortnite are made
gaming,"So soon? What?

Xbox 360 came out 4 years after Xbox

Xbox One came out 7 years after 360.

It'll now be 7 years since x1.

Like...seriously. 7 years is a long time. It's a 10th of your life."
gaming,So did they just not run the Sonic model through any kind focus group do see what they thought or did they just not care what people thought
gaming,Gangsters paradise right there.
gaming,Is this a fresh pasta or have I just not heard this before?
gaming,"It took four friends all sitting in a room with me, everyone pissed off (some at each other) for me to realize how stupid it was. None of us were actually enjoying ourselves. Moment of clarity I guess. I scooted back from my chair, went and got a 12 pack while they started another game, and never touched it again."
gaming,"Too late. Oh god, what have I done..  
Some trolls are the most cruel people, but holy fuck some of Chris-chan's actions are downright disturbing."
gaming,why is this in r/gaming?
gaming,I'mma hurt you real bad.
gaming,I guess Kye is not a hero then.
gaming,He’s gonna carry the whole movie
gaming,"I don’t think it matters what they do.  Sonic is just too uncanny valley me.  Realistic or cartoony, pick a lane.  A bit like Bay’s TMNT.  I don’t think I can look a that thing for 90 min."
gaming,Sounds like what a McDonalds lover would say
gaming,"Two things:
&gt; Relax, and try not to get too anxious

&gt; practice. You'll be bad at the beginning, but with enough practice with people your level, you'll improve!!"
gaming,"I wish I could freshly experience the Persona series again. I'm holding out hope for remakes of the first three, especially three."
gaming,"Don’t start with this “kids movie for kids” rhetoric.

If that were the case, this would be Sonic BOOM! Movie.

This is a movie that is banking on nostalgia, and to claim otherwise is either naivety or ignorance."
gaming,Just make sonic look like he could be there. I guess they are trying to get the classic sonic feel. But the sonic adventure style is what they should try to reach.
gaming,"1 not everyone cares about fps, like me, 2 i never said consoles or choosing them was bad, only that you cant pull shit out of your ass like ""consoles are more powerful than any pc"" and not expect backlash"

gaming,Welcome to the Island of Dr. Moreau . [https://youtu.be/JR6KzLR4xnA?t=4](https://youtu.be/JR6KzLR4xnA?t=4)
gaming,I think the logic was probably that the original looks too cartoony and maybe too jarring juxtaposed next to real actors... but what they ended up with just looks like a deformity that needs to be dealt with with fire
gaming,"Not secure men. Some of us can handle intelligent, capable women."
gaming,I’ve got one word for ya Kim: product placement.
gaming,"When I was an idiot child, I thought the pokemon center sometimes increased your pokemon’s total hp, so at one point I was just spamming nurse Joy because I didn’t understand that leveling up was what increased my hp."
gaming,"Sonic has a very, very long track record of horrendous games that killed a lot of their fanbase and those that stayed kind of relish in the despair in a weird way.  I haven’t even gotten to the weird fanart types because that is another can of worms.

There are bright spots like Sonic Colors and Sonic Generations but since Sonic Adventure 2 we’ve had Sonic 1 GBA ports that are more broken than a Chinese RAM knockoff and the infamous Sonic 2006."
gaming,Cant you do the same thing with r/playstation?
gaming,Then they should make a new different movie with that character in mind instead of applying that into what is already an established character
gaming,"Hey, I shower twice a week what more do you want from me?!?!?"
gaming,"Online team games are always toxic shitholes. Even PvE ones, but it's much worse in PvP games. And in single player PvP games you get by your opponents. Really doesn't matter which game you chose, only way to escape that hellhole is play alone vs AI or with friends."
gaming,Just what somebody who plays LoL and doesn't want other people to think he knows what it is would say
gaming,I think the production team got confused and thought “gotta to fast!” was their MO instead of Sonic’s catchphrase.
gaming,"+10 for Buster ~~Skrugs~~ Scruggs reference.

gaming,F for Kyle everyone
gaming,The people in charge don’t know what they are doing
gaming,"A trailer for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie came out today. People are saying it's ruined the franchise. But the franchise has been on the decline for over a decade now. It's older fans have declared it ruined several times. 

So this image is suggesting that while the newer fans are seeing this as ruining Sonic, older fans have been here before."
gaming,This looks worse than the monkey kid.
gaming,I think *boat* is a little bit of an understatement.
gaming,Turns out they neither could nor should.

gaming,"It actually is fallout new Vegas then fallout 4 then fallout 3, i don’t like fallout 76 as it’s still buggy as fuck"
gaming,Dr. Eggman looks good though.
gaming,He looks like the flippin Honeycomb Crunch monster on the right.
gaming,"The majority is usually wrong. In the modern era being massively popular requires appealing to the lowest common denominator, which means being shit. Walmart, McDonalds, Nickelback, Marvel movies, and League of Legends.

I see your strikethrough there. If you fail to understand why time and space balancing factors must exist in an action pvp game and how their removal leads to homogenization like the champ kits in LoL then I feel bad for you son... because you probably listen to Nickelback."
gaming,Dota is way better and such a higher skill cap.
gaming,"Because they're way more complex to do/program/whatever.

gaming,"&gt;You can't hold Paladins accountable for the actions of a company that owns controlling interest in one of Paladins' developers.

This is a clear example of you not knowing what youre talking about.
Tencent WORKED on paladins.
They worked on the art.
They practically traced Dragon Trainer Tristana skin from League of Legends for the RoboForce Ruckus skin.

Goblin Network had the Lex artwork (Covert Ops) that was removed from Paladins strike, because it literally stole a screencap from Overwatch.

Im not going to argue with you.
Its clear lex was based (read: entirely ripped) from Lucian. Hi-Rez has had a VERY long track record of ""copying"" with Paladins AND Smite. Whether it be designing characters or straight up artwork.
Its fine if you think they didn't. Its not fine, hypocritical, and outright foolish to claim that fortnite is copying but paladins doesn't.
You can believe they aren't copying, but thats not the truth or anything outside of falsehoods."

Dreamcast sonic actually has spiky teeth like real hedgehogs.   

Modern sonic has conjoined teeth, just like his eyes. 

Boom sonic has more seemingly human teeth, but not as much as movie sonic.   

So basically we saw sonic constantly evolving into more human across the years. Epic"

He needs a goddamn makeover not an easy fix lol."

Second, play more. Obviously, the more you get into confrontations and the more types of situations you experience, the more comfortable you'll get. You see how situations play out and how different reactions garner success or failure. I used to be the same way in R6 Siege when our team got down to 1 or 2 players, but I improved over time. 

Third, learn the game mechanics for the specific shooter you're playing. Map knowledge, the guns' handling and behaviour, or character skills are all important. Then just do activities (or just play) related to what you wanna improve. Train your reflexes or muscle memory, try aiming exercises, or just play in a private lobby to get a feel for a new character/weapon/whatever."

gaming,"Ya,  I sense a sequel to dragonball evolution in this. 

This is definitely a movie that I will have to go watch on my own."
gaming,Nice that one made me laugh
gaming,"Literally just click+dragged his eyes a little bigger. Makes his nose and mouth even seem more cartoon-y without actually touching them.

I feel like sonic looks way too human-adjacent.  Those eyes, the teeth, and (of course) that odd choice of body shape (looks like it was easier to just mo-cap a human and scale them down rather than warp the structure, itself).

Just wanted to see if small changes would have made this Sonic more approachable. :\"
gaming,That's good to know lol
gaming,"Depends on the game. 
If it's a straight shooter. It's literally just practice makes perfect. 

Or you could find something like Overwatch, where there's mechanics aside from shooting. And you'd just have to try different playstyles until you find what works for you."

gaming,"If you want to keep it on earth, an asteroid crashes on earth, doctor eggman begins researching it and then gets infected by the nano-tech. The nano-tech begins converting the natural world to robots (ala the games). Half an hour in, Sonic shows up to save the day.

Sonic is super cocky and gets beat by robotnick (the new bad guy name he takes on).

Sonic is rescued by robotnick's ex-assistant/son/wife who is themselves a brilliant scientist. This human is the brain and Sonic the brawn.

Sonic learns that sometimes it's good to slow down and think through problems. The human learns to stand up to eggman (who was abusive) and assert their strength.

There's a plot that makes basic sense with some character growth."

I'm just saying that the similarities you'd brought up prior like the Lex/Lucian moveset comparisons wasn't a very strong argument, because a number of their similarities are recurring tropes in media such as the double gun shot, command dash, and ""black guy with two guns""."
gaming,Yasuo mains in a nutshell
gaming,"Titanfall 2 ain’t free but it has been as little as $5 in recent months. Not too hard to pick up and be alright at but there is a decent learning curve after that to be amazing. A really fun game to sink some hours into imo. 

To be honest you are really limiting yourself with the free part. Most free games are limited in what they provide and any extras provided are usually behind a paywall. You would be better off selecting a game as a group, something like Rainbow 6 Siege, dropping $30 on it each and those games provide a good amount of content with a good amount of support and replay value.

Edit: 2 free mobile games I have enjoyed are Forward Assault and Modern Combat: Versus. Free, pretty good looking for mobile and have some form of esports scene if you’re looking at getting good. Forward Assault is kind of a CSGO for mobile deal and Modern Combat Versus is a bit more of a futuristic military Overwatch."

gaming,"old gamer here.  If this is the first experience you've had with media pillaging your childhood for the sake of a nostalgia cash-grab, I'm afraid i have some bad news regarding the rest of your life."
gaming,"See I’m a bit older. Pokemon was about 4 years after I was age-appropriate for it. I might have seen 5-10 episodes stoned in college. Never played any of the games. With no nostalgic tie to the IP and only knowing about it through memes, Detective Pikachu is the first time I’ve considered seeing something Pokémon-related on purpose.

Sonic 1-3 and ever Spinball were big parts of my childhood. This looks terrible.

But even though I loved those games, I never wanted or cared about a Sonic movie. There’s no story there that needs to be told. So even though this looks shitty, at least I wasn’t looking forward to it, and I don’t think most people were.

It’s hilariously bad-looking, but without letting anyone down because no one was counting on it in the first place."

gaming,They kinda remade 1 and 2 on the psp. They were pretty fun as far as I remember.  They were like the Star Ocean remakes for the psp. Not so much a remake but a revamping with the same mechanics as 3. I think they ended up porting a shortened version of 3 to the psp as well after FES came out on ps2 though. I imagine it was a task tofit all 140 hours of it onto a umd disc.

gaming,"There's a difference between a game dying and just becoming irrelevant. 

Dota 2 is irrelevant.

WoW will only die by suicide. 

The whole investment thing is really only  relevant to WoW. If a better mmo did come along, it'd have to compete with WoW on several different levels and be twice as good for people to even bother ditching their 20 year old accounts. 


League isn't even the same and Riot knows this. It's entire identity is competition. Riot is also not handling the game well at all. There is near zero investment in merchandise and people aren't forming any kind of bond with the game like people do with WoW.

Theres just no real competition for Lol. When dota and league were head to head both games were great, now theyre both just terrible and catering to the casual player (even more in leagues case). Dota lost to league and just have up then copied league. League then just amped up the in game shop and started taking the game in a new direction. 

The FPS market is just trash now. CS had no real competition and still can't compete with league after gambling got nerfed. I have a lot of qualms with the engine and direction personally. It's just a complete mess all around in typical valve fashion.

Just an example of league being on the edge of death is how big new games are when they come out. Apex is still leaching the top league streamers and that games essentially not relevant either. I'm fairly sure when Halo mcc comes on PC you'll see another huge decrease in league for a couple months. The issue is it'll die our fairly quick bc people grinded halo for years and won't be interested to do it long term again. Happens with every remake release"

gaming,They’re great until *you’re* the recipient of said physics.
gaming,"That's funny, because that same advice applies to you. Stop whining and keep scrolling."
gaming,"Remember kids, YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!!"
gaming,Make sure you give it human teeth also
gaming,"Many of the negative responses from the movie trailer are similar to the top panel, feeling this is the death of Sonic. Some of the more vocal criticisms have been over the character design of Sonic for looks and visual features.

However, the Sonic franchise has already been shaky over the years w/ many of the releases since the glory days of the franchise. It's a series that's underwent many transformations in game play/style/graphics/story over the decades sometimes vastly different from the original form and not always for the better..."
gaming,"After seeing and posting so much dumbass Sonic memes, it feels good to look at this beautiful artwork. Thank you, you saved a Dark Soul."
gaming,Dang I was mistaken
gaming,"I can hear it now.

""People don't want to see sonic like he used to be. People want to see a new, modern sonic! The kids of today don't care what he looked like. Just make sure every hair is animated on this cash cow!"""
gaming,HOLY SHIT HIS TOO OP
gaming,Me 99% of the time. Just happened to have photoshop open and some downtime from work haha.
gaming,"Nope, but now I want to know."
gaming,"No 3 things:

“Quick! Change the channel!”"
gaming,"Sorry to disappoint. No photoshop. Sonic in all his glory.

gaming,Looks more like a cat
gaming,What pokémon center is that!?
gaming,"What family
 I see him on the weekends and he lives in his parents basement. Hes also 39"
gaming,"Am I the only one seeing that sonic in the first pic looks like he’s...

Well

I’m just not gonna say"
gaming,"In this pic he looks like that thing Katie in that meme when she's back ping up look in all creepy as Hell when the elephant talks to her. Jesus the animation  looks horrific,  and just so bad"
gaming,"Studios release multiple trailers now, containing more and more info. I think it will be a bit formulaic, given its a kids film. But I say give it a chance. Its got Jim Carey as eggman in it."
gaming,"Just wait till you play the ""Wine and Blood"" DLC... It's almost a full game!!!"
gaming,Looks nothing alike but okay.
gaming,I commented this like 8 hours ago on one of these posts. It looks SUPER similar lol
gaming,"Super Mario Bros was a colossal failure, yes.  But at least they took risks.  They took Mario and Luigi and set them inside a Total Recall universe.  Still one of the most fun super 90s movies out there."
gaming,Why can’t they make a good Sonic game?
gaming,"1. Why does he have human teeth?
2. Why is the theme song “Gangsta’s Paradise?”
3. Why am I so unsettled by the fact that he’s nude?"
gaming,You’re welcome for the idea... way to steal my post. Congrats for all the karma due to your photoshop skills.
gaming,Eehmmm I think you mean soda
gaming,"Oh don't worry you can tell by the end of the trailer that he will ""discover"" his hidden power and be so fast time stands still."
gaming,Didn’t know Sega were also Paramount Pictures.
gaming,"Not sure what's worse, this design or Captain anti-vax (Jim Carrey) being Dr. Robotnik."
gaming,It would honestly be better if Sonic was just replaced by Mark Ruffalo in a blue unitard.
gaming,Loved those games but would only want to see HD remastered not remakes.
gaming,Never skip leg decade.
gaming,"She also has an insta-spell when touching his goods to get him as hard as Death March on command that she used in a hot-tub post one battle.   


Handy thing. Pun intended."

But then again, I might just write him a letter of appreciation and condolences instead."

gaming,So we are basically fucking a bunch of magical Uma's the whole game? That is pretty messed up.
gaming,Its not really Addiction but more of Stockholm syndrome
gaming,You leave Sonic alone! Can NOBODY live up to your impossible body standards?!!
gaming,*Still types GG ez*
gaming,This must be close to double figures on this one though. It's every month or so.
gaming,Pokemon and monster hunter pls
gaming,"Hope you're doing a little better, my dude."
gaming,It almost looks  like a tower defense game. I have no idea what it is but I want to
gaming,I ask myself the same thing about Detective pilachu all the time.
gaming,And let’s not look past that Nike advertisement
gaming,"The biggest problem with this movie isn’t going to be just the look, it’s that it’s so obvious the creators don’t give a shit about the source. Sonic is a known name, that’s all they wanted. This is reminiscent of the 90s/2000s where adaptations would always use the bare concept of a character and everything else would be completely different.

This is just a generic buddy movie with the Sonic name on it. “Alien teams up with guy and takes on baddies”. We’ll get eggman in a poor version of his source material appearance and some very poor bait for a sequel we know will never happen."
gaming,I can't tell the difference.
gaming,"The same for me.  Though I understand the basis for it is from a fan artist who created hyper realistic Pokemon.  But Hollywood just took this fun fan project and decided to make it into a big movie.  

And it perfectly encapsulates the problem with Hollywood.  They look down on video games and animation as a third tier form of art.  Many don't even consider them art.  So whenever they get the rights to adapt them, they 1) Make them live action and 2) Make them hyper realistic and as opposite of the animated designs as possible.  The upcoming Pokemon movie is a rare exception where the original designs were already hyper realistic.  But I mean, just look at this new Sonic film to see the path Hollywood usually takes.  

All anime and video game adaptations go down this route, usually fail spectacularly, and Hollywood still doesn't change.  It's almost as if they're intentionally trying to sabotage them.  Which begs the question, why even make them?  Why spend $100 million making a live action adaptation of Dragon Ball, Speed Racer, Ghost in the Shell or whatever, movies which don't make a profit, when Japan can just make another animated movie for $5 million and get 10x profit back?  If Hollywood actually cared about profit, they'd be trying to make animation more popular, not less.  But they don't care about profit.  They're prideful and think only live action counts as ""valid."""
gaming,"I wanna say it's Dwarf Fortress. I've never actually played it, but it looks very similar."
gaming,"I dont know about you but I have played PLENTY of older games that have issues, and they always will since they CAN'T get fixed, unless it's a re-release/port. You should count your lucky stars that we at least live in a time where we can easily go online to see if a game has any known issues. Back in the day you got to read a game had a 10/10 in a game magazine just to find out you spent $50 on a piece of crap"
gaming,"I know, it's BS you're being attacked for this. My comment was instantly removed, here's one example of the repost: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/bj3kql/what_the_fuck_is_this/em55n1q"

gaming,"Just realized he’s wearing Nike, fuck them!"
gaming,His reaction to getting nuked by a meteor is similar to if he had accidentally touched a hot stove.  That always bothered me.
gaming,"I wonder if they had a focus group to test the design on. At this point, when trying make a cashcow out of these IPs, they really need to double check. It's been decades now and so many video game movie adaptions flop"
gaming,"I think this one is better:

gaming,Roguelike of some sort.. trying to find it now
gaming,IMDB has him listed as Dr Ivo Robotnik.
gaming,Huh I just assumed their site still had full versions. If not...what a loss.
gaming,There’s also an episode on Stargate SG-1 about this too.
gaming,"Lol it wasn’t an add—he just said, didn’t he get fucked by the Phoenix and then deleted it. Please, I welcome all the jokes. For example he could have said he got fucked by a Wolverine"
gaming,That’s the best comparison ever haha !!
gaming,I keep thinking of those three ugly sorceress and now that’s all I picture Yen as
gaming,"Maybe with all these memes making fun of this horrible looking sonic will entice the producers to change him to how he should look, we can only hope...."
gaming,"Clearly the greatest anime is Pucca.
The best anime protagonist is Bowser from Sonic."
gaming,"Same here. Looks like dwarf fortress, but never played that."
gaming,His teeth are going to give me nightmares.
gaming,Sonic games been garbage since 2000.
gaming,Yeah to an extent its just a thing that happens because sorceresses are the members of families that can't get married off due to being deformed. The counterpoint being some like Ciri's mom naturally were pretty.
gaming,Is this a vr game? Ive seen this making the rounds.
gaming,"I still don't understand why it wasn't fully animated like Sonic Unleashed or Sonic Mania, or THE ORIGINAL SONIC MOVIE! If the Adventure games and '06 are anything to go by, Sonic does *not* work in a realistic setting."
gaming,I was gonna do this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
gaming,"False. This game is terrible for many reasons, which is why I only have 2,800 hours in it."
gaming,Deviation from this system will cause you to be switched out by another nurse joy clone &amp; never seen again
gaming,Look how they massacred my boy...
gaming,It's so the Nike shoes still look like nike shoes
gaming,God. Damn. It. I made this comparison in head when I fucking saw it.
gaming,"Did you watch the trailer?

Everything about this looks terrible.  It's possible these scenes aren't in the movie, but Jesus Christ.  The lines Robotnik has when talking to the army guy?  Shoot me now.

It would be different if it were JUST Sonic looking like garbage, but it's not.  The CGI is terrible, the jokes are awful, the script is abysmal, the music choice is nonsensical, the voice acting seems horrendous, and all the shitty videogame movie tropes seem to be in full effect.  And this is a *trailer,* mind you.  It's supposed to sell people on the movie.  

People aren't just saying it looks awful to hop on the bandwagon.  It is transparently trying to copy all the other pop culture movies that came before it, and doing an *awful* job at it.  

Just the ""talk really fast and use big words"" gag when Robotnik is talking to the army guy... the execution of that is *so* bad, and yet they thought it was good enough *to put in the trailer*... I mean, this movie is not for me.

Honestly, what I have seen so far actually offends me.  I don't say that lightly (nor do I expect anyone to give a shit about me being offended).  There just seems to be *absolutely* no redeeming artistic merit to this.  It's like they didn't even try.  At any part in the process."
gaming,"I hate the idea that time everywhere is relatively stopped to sonic. Part of the game was the uncontrollability.

Also, I hate this movie"
gaming,I want this so bad for DND make my whole world and then drop my players in it
gaming,Let's just say I don't have any of my games consoles that came out before the Xbox 360 any more apart from the Nintendo 64 because I told my dad I would kill him if it got sold
gaming,"Got the call I’ve been waiting for all day literally five minutes after I posted that. 

Was fantastic news. I have to see sonic now since it’s lucky, I guess. Although it looks like a teletubby. I still have nightmares about those demons."
gaming,Someone call Natalie Dormer!
gaming,"Please, Dragonball Evolution had some vision and coherence to it. This just seems all over the place and disjointed"
gaming,"Oh boy, you aren’t the brightest bulb in the hardware store."
gaming,Its all downhill from here

gaming,I agree. The overreaction is a bit much.
gaming,can someone link the controller that there using?
gaming,"But why use Sonic? I’m 19 and Sonic hasn’t been popular in my whole lifetime. 

The only audience of kids I could imagine them getting would be the ones who watched that recent animated series, but if they wanted those kids, they should have just made an animated film"
gaming,Has Kirk ever won a best kiss award? Didn’t think so
gaming,"LOL is way more popular, even though it's so much worse than Dota, balance, graphics, models, mechanics... So it makes perfect sense. Riot is just a better marketer, and the game itself is easier to get into and get reasonably okish at."
gaming,“Reporting” ... “Moving out!”
gaming,"From the trailer, it seems like Jim Carrey might at least be funny, since he does well with characters that are rude assholes.

The rest of the movie...meh. I stopped playing Sonic games after they moved away from the 2D platforming genre, so the franchise has been fucked up the ass for me for a long time. Shit like Sonic and the Black Knight already killed the franchise for me."
gaming,You ever done cocaine? The highs are comperable to the lows.
gaming,A wild Bidoof is spotted and immeditely cut in half by a huge ass anime sword
gaming,"Yeah it will probably be the world ends or some thing, weird giant green hill zone mushroom forests. And he survives and wants to kill Sonic because he blames him.

And then the games start. =/"
gaming,"I mean, Nuts and Bolts. Especially if you were waiting for the 3rd game in the series and were excited beyond expression for the new release and the trailer sold it as being a continuation of your favorite franchise.

gaming,His Teeth? Wtf what about his nostrils?!?
gaming,"League is like pizza rolls.

gaming,"Insurgency: sandstorm, in my opinion, is probably the best made shooter of all time. I don't play it very often because I guess I'm over shooters now but I'm kind of blown away at the sounds and immersion when I do bring it up. Teenage me would probably decide it's my new religion."
gaming,"oh man, ghost in the shell. A visually stunning movie but they took out all the depth of the original movie just to make it dumb enough for western audiences. The OG movie never really explained anything to you, in fact the first time I watched it I'm not sure I fully understood it (as in the specific plot points, not the overall theme). But the Americanized version had to have this weird, watered down plot that somehow tries to explain off everything in a frankly cringey way. People over the world loved and understood the original! I get it, you want newcomers to watch this and ""take it seriously"" as it were. You want new audiences to approach this and not feel overwhelmed with a quasi-philosophical movie. But the original wasn't an unsolveable riddle, either. If you wanted us to take it seriously then fuckin' keep the complex plot in there. I shudder in thought if they were considering making stand alone complex, too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shame because man, those visuals. Beautiful. And the subpar story made it so hollow."

It started as an April fools joke in 2015, and proved so popular that they brought it back every year since, with some changes to keep it fresh.

They haven't made it a permanent move though, as it apparently leads to massive player burnout, and significantly drops the active player count a couple of weeks after it goes live."

&amp;#x200B;

Like, I don't hate the fact they want to make a movie. I'm not even entirely hating on it being live action. But taking the cartoonish anatomy of Pokemon and adding fur and very expressive eyes just FREAKS ME OUT. I can deal with it in a static illustration. I also really love the realistic Pikachus that actually look like animals! But going down that middle route of ""keep the anatomy but add fur"" is way too uncanny valley for me. I ain't hating on the illustrator, good job man and good job for getting attention to your work. But yikes."

gaming,"Absolutely true, I believe it might be when they're in a hot-tub under armed guard and going to take their own lives as Emhyr granted them some time together &amp; a private death. Geralt and Ciri between them almost accidentally talk him into leaving without Ciri though and so they're spared, in the books Emhyr actually wanted to make incestuous babies with his own daughter to fulfil a prophecy. Funnily enough they skate over that in the games. Probably for the best.

&amp;#x200B;

I got through all of the books on audible last year, minus an incredibly grating high pitched Scottish voice the narrator chose for Siri (he'd been brilliant otherwise, in his defense) they're a fantastic listen.  


The first or second time they meet each other Yennefer effectively mind controls Geralt into marching around the town that they're in and kicking the shit out of everyone who mocked her. She's inherently bad for him but he's head over heels. They also bang immediately after almost being killed by the Djinn that Geralt uses to bind them in the now wreckage of a two storey house."
gaming,"Obviously, they did it for the Nike product placement. It’s so shameless."
gaming,There is absolutely no way this movie is going to bomb with the amount it's getting talked about
gaming,"But even if they had accurately remade the movie, it wouldn't have been necessary.  The idea of remaking an animated movie into live action, be it anime or Disney or whatever, is just an insult to animation.  And that's Hollywood's intention.  This upcoming Lion King remake is going to be the biggest insult yet."

gaming,You might think you don’t want that but you do
gaming,"Space Jam was my first thought. I just watched it again a couple weeks ago (it's on Hulu!) and it still holds up surprisingly well. I think maybe because they weren't trying to make them look like anything other than cartoons. Whereas this monstrosity... it doesn't even hold up well now, let alone in 20 years."
gaming,"Idk who thought this seemed like a good idea but literally everything about this movie smells of puke covered turd.

Side note: I have never been into Pokémon, however that movie preview has me wanting to see a Pokémon movie for the first time in my life. It actually looks good.

But sonic? Well...let's just [Punxsutawney Phil](https://giphy.com/gifs/bill-murray-groundhog-day-gif-14saZ73y5Ik5uE) would be ashamed."
gaming,I like this pluralization. It’s like Attorneys general
gaming,She's way too arrogant to let just anyone hit.
gaming,The only thing that bothers me is the teeth.  Otherwise it would have looked even worse if they had tried to make sonic look more like the second image. They probably even played around with something like the second image and realized the nightmare fuel they had created would have done untold damage to the brand and our psyche.  I said this about the live action Aladdin before they even showed us a blue Will Smith.  Some cartoon  characters just don't  translate well to the real world and sometimes even the best animation artists like those employed by Disney can barely make it work.
gaming,What year is it?
gaming,Never skip leg day
gaming,Thank you!!! I've been saying this all day!

gaming,"You’re missing a “?” After Jumanj. That reads:

gaming,"It’s unfortunate that Sonic has been let down by Sega so much, those games and Legend of Zelda were my childhood.

In my opinion, the best sonic games (that weren’t the old school sides scrolling ones) were Sonic Adventures 1 and 2. Sonic Heroes was meh, but made way for the story of Shadow The Hedgehog (also kinda weird for a Sonic game with the guns and swearing), but I enjoyed playing them all because their story connected.

Sonic 2006 I never played cause I was poor, o o watched it online. It was interesting with the new characters, and the graphics and cutscenes were fantastic for it’s time, but the beastiality/romance thing between Sonic and the human princess was kinda creepy and weird.

Sonic and the Black Knight I actually enjoyed playing regardless of how odd it was, because I love the Arthurian basis of the story.

Seven Rings I couldn’t play because the controls sucked on the Wii, and Sonic Unleashed seemed to be rushed, as the cutscenes were poorly done and the story was overall weird. 

I haven’t played another Sonic game since (considering the ones released after all seemed to be racing games which was just a knockoff Mario Kart).

One thing I will say is that even if the games let me down, which they did very frequently, the soundtracks have always been fantastic and always made it worthwhile. Crush40 always brings back nostalgia."

gaming,Lol what a surprise
gaming,My regular edition has been doing just fine if you ask me
gaming,It actually is better. This pushed him out of the uncanny valley at least.
gaming,"Terribly unpopular opinion right now, but I totally agree with you. Had they not completely screwed the pooch with Sonic's design, then this movie would probably be getting a lot of positive PR at the moment."
gaming,Glad that your N64 wasn't taken from you :). Recently picked up a N64 and I love it :)
gaming,"This is exactly what happens to me after I talk about LoL for two minutes:

 ""UGH fuck this game... NO one listens to pings, team is blind and brain dead. Im going to uninstall! I've had it with these kids...""  \*hits play again\* ""....I hate myself."""
gaming,They made sonic look too cute.
gaming,This game is damn worth 60 usd. For 2 bucks it's a steal
gaming,"This sonic is the thing no one wanted, and feels like was a decision by committee.

A compromise between human and cartoon that makes everyone unhappy."
gaming,the two literally look nothing a like but we cant stop circle jerking away
gaming,"If Sega is smart, they will be on the Genesis Mini.  It has 2 Mickey games, so it's not a long shot."
gaming,"I didn't watch the new Ghostbusters. I didn't watch the new TMNT. Probably not going to watch this either.

Childhood preserved."
gaming,"I’m always surprised about all the whinging Tencent and China’s investment in Reddit caused, and yet tons of kids in here will happily jump on LoL"
gaming,What is this? Are y'all migrants from tumblr
gaming,This is one of my favorite games ever.
gaming,At least get the eyes right smh
gaming,The kid that's into sonic is cause their parents are (most likely) and will most likely share the same sentiment. If this is only being marketed towards kids that's just a terrible idea when the much larger demographic of people with nostalgia exists too.
gaming,I knew it looked familiar!
gaming,"That whole ""I prefer 30 fps"" is a placebo effect. It's just people lying to themselves so they can cope with the fact that they weren't able to play 60fps"
gaming,Nash was changed to Charlie.
gaming,"Your forearms are gunna be tired, but I'll give it perfect 5/7"
gaming,Definitely $2 worth of fun.
gaming,Gotta get that product placement. Fan service be damned.
gaming,I'm actually saving this comment for when the movie comes out
gaming,I dunno I watched the trailer and I think it looks like fun.
gaming,Fucking low elo ivern jungle bullshit
gaming,Go ahead and downvote. Thieves gonna thieve.
gaming,The more accurate version makes the movie version look like a furry.
gaming,"Holy shit, a company wants to make money? In a capitalist country?"
gaming,Nice cable management. 9.7/10
gaming,"Stole my karma...

Thanks mang"
gaming,Holy shit that's spot on
gaming,"When I want to see something that I label ""it's so bad it's good"" I wait until it's released for home viewing. I'm not spending the kind of money it takes to go to a theater nowadays for a bad movie. I'll definitely end up watching this someday, but probably while drunk at a friend's house so we can make fun of it."
gaming,Dude fuck yeah!! I was just talking to my coworker about this earlier today. I'm so glad I'm not alone.
gaming,"totally, not sure why they are acting like it was an original idea as well when they are replying to people saying good post. its totally ripped from a comment in anither sonic thread ftim hours ago..."
gaming,that shit looks stupid. strong work paramount
gaming,Yeah that’s where I got the idea but they don’t allow memes over there :(
gaming,They had to put that Nike sponsorship in there.
gaming,He's busy hunting Graboids.
gaming,SA 2 is $2.50 right now on Steam
gaming,Mods are salty trash that's why
gaming,So how was the movie? Could you provide me with some details as me and my child are going to go see it when it comes out because he just likes sonic.
gaming,Never underestimate Hollywood's stupidity and incompetence.
gaming,What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
gaming,He must be a Dunkey fan
gaming,"who is this ""@$$h0le with sunglasses""?"
gaming,He looks like a fat Charlie Cox.
gaming,It’s been driving me absolutely insane to what he fucking reminds me off! Now I know!!
gaming,I think he’s probably got a top end PC but only uses it to complain in forums at a Diamond level about games and watch anime.
gaming,"But ya, these are the reasons I hardly buy day 1 releases of anything anymore. Skyrim and No Man's Sky are prime examples of being games I bought day 1 and was pissed with how broken they could be... it didn't keep me from sinking 400+ hours into Skyrim though lol

I played about 100 hours of No Man's Sky before I traded it in so I at least felt I got my money's worth"
gaming,On the hanging man's face u need to put sammy
gaming,Look at Chris Chan over here...
gaming,I thought TF2 was like Arma
gaming,"I would be the first in the line waiting for the movie if Sonic was well made but they really fumbled the ball on that one...

Sega... I wonder when you will stop ruining Sonic."
gaming,"I mean, it’s a realistic perspective. It ain’t too bad but what killed me was the Nike sign lmaoo"
gaming,You fucking nailed it.
gaming,"Honestly, the top version would have been better"
gaming,"Naw, it’s a god damn bank robbery"
gaming,That's cuz they wanted him to look realistic duh..
gaming,Where have you been sending the bread?!
gaming,"Respectfully disagree. Just research everything you can, then use something like PC Part Picker to ensure compatibility between the parts."
gaming,"I can't believe this actor is in this movie, I kept thinking sonic looks wiwedly like him and then he's the cop?? Can anyone else see the resemblance? The odd mouth, the eyes??"
gaming,*Sweeps with dragonbreath the entire area*
gaming,"I never drink... tea.

gaming,"A big part of why Raul Julia was so amazing in that movie was that he knew that the movie was awful, so he decided to simply enjoy himself."
gaming,I remember the Joe DiMaggio hospital in FL had these alongside a GameCube stand
gaming,It's funny how many players LoL has when so many of them hate the game
gaming,"Nuts and Bolts was a fun game, it sure as hell wasn't a Banjo game, but it was fun. Kinda like Assassins Creed 4."
gaming,"it broke my PS4 so, no it’s not fun"
gaming,Human teeth? Seriously? I’m getting Justice League CGI Mouth-Man flashbacks.
gaming,Is what you did when you said a sequel to one of the most acclaimed Disney films of the past decade was a bigger gamble than the Sonic movie
gaming,"Video game tournaments in general. 

I will not allow someone to attend if they smell offensive. 

I get it, its work. I sweat. I shower in the mornings and before every event. I apply deodorant several times per day."
gaming,Seriously. Who did this? That looks like it’s based on a drawing I did of Sonic when I was 7.
gaming,That was my first thought
gaming,Wait is it really going straight on Netflix? Like no cinema releases?
gaming,"Im a simple guy, I see TF2... I upvote"
gaming,"If you're running windows 10, it has a capture program built in. Search for game dvr in your start menu and you can adjust capture length and folder."
gaming,"Must be cold. It's only six degrees, Kevin Bacon."
gaming,Im thinking Paramount just threw away money on this one
gaming,"SNES is superior for both versions, fight me.  For Aladdin, yeah SEGA has a sword which makes it the cooler version when you're a kid, but the SNES version by Capcom is a better *game*.  And then Lion King, they're the same game but the music is better on the SNES (with the exception of Hakuna Matata, which is better served by the Genesis/Mega Drive percussive sounds)."
gaming,Lmao i commented this a couple hours ago and didn't get any response. glad to see you think the same.
gaming,"Robotnik is supposed to fat as hell though, I could never see his character played this way."
gaming,This Sonic reminds me of when Peter from Jumanji turned into a monkey.
gaming,Gamma ray exposure or hypertension?
gaming,She looks like a who from the live-action Grinch movie
gaming,"The only thing I want from this movie is a scene of Sonic on a small precarious ledge and Tails helicoptering onto that ledge, pushing Sonic to his death. 

Fuck you, Tails."
gaming,It looks exactly like sonic if I described it somebody who had never seen him before
gaming,"I'm an IT Manager, and before this gig I ran my own brick and mortar computer repair shop for 10 years. Yea, generally it's a bit more expensive to build one and if anything goes wrong it's much more complicated to warranty the part with the manufacturer. If you want to learn how to build a computer I suggest finding a really really cheap computer for under 100 bucks on eBay or Craigslist and take that apart and put it together a few times. Don't learn on expensive brand new parts. If you install the processor wrong you have the chance of ruining a 150 dollar motherboard and a 200 dollar processor.

I'm happy to answer questions.

Edit: learn not leave."
gaming,If only the cuts were cleaner... then again you could just cut out some red vinyl sticker and place them around the buttons and ports. It would look good and hide the ugly at the same time
gaming,There was no blue kid in Jumanji...
gaming,Damn even r/gaming hates this
gaming,"Whether you should live or die

Oh you'll probably go to heaven please don't hang your head and cry~"
gaming,If you have blue colorblindness this is just a picture of Tyrion Lannister and some raccoon
gaming,I need the template for this!
gaming,My elementary aged son was excited about the movie until we saw what sonic looks like. He was horrified.
gaming,Space Jam had literal fucking Looney Toons in the movie and that is considered an absolute classic.
gaming,They had Castlevania Symphony of the Night. I've sunk hundreds of hours into that game.
gaming,Obviously there'd be an acclimatisation period. It's just so much deeper and more rewarding of a game though
gaming,"I mean , I’m still gonna watch it though"
gaming,"""LET ME FUCKING HEAL"""
gaming,"That's kinda the point I'm hinting at.  Hollywood thinks they're superior to everything else.  And this mentality leads them to think they not only can change a product, but should.  Because obviously their changes, no matter what they are, will be better than the original source.  Be it adapting an anime, a Star Wars sequel, rebooting Star Trek, ugly Sonic, whatever.

Then the fans hate it and the film does poorly in the box office/BD sales.  And instead of reflecting on the cause, they just blame the fans as being misogynists/racists/whatever and move onto the next project, repeating the same mistake.  It's all blind ego.

The few properties which have succeeded in the last decade, like Marvel and MLP, are ones which DID pay attention to what made the IP popular in the past and implemented that in the new movies/show."
gaming,Live action Sonic hurts my soul it looks so bad.
gaming,I am seriously not bothered by the cgi but the dialogue we get in the trailer is so so so bad.
gaming,I really hope we got a plot that is somewhat similar to that of the sonic bible.
gaming,It's like the 2nd episode of The IT Crowd.
gaming,I'm not sure why everyone is making fun of this movie. I'm genuinely excited and can't wait to see the visual effects.
gaming,Have you seen yongyeas video on this
gaming,"I mean, they are speaking the truth thru that bumper sticker."
gaming,"If you want to reply to somebody, you have to hit the actual reply button.  You just added another parent-level comment, telling nobody in particular ""Yes that is what I meant."""
gaming,"Showed this trailer to my kids who love watching my DVDs of the original cartoon and the OVA sonic movie. They think he looks extremely weird, and wanna stick to the games and older cartoons..... when you got kids saying that about your movie that's supposed to be marketed toward them you got a problem."
gaming,Honestly after watching the trailer this movie looks like it could be a goofy movie that would be fun to watch. The only issues I had with it was the music choice and the look of sonic but honestly that second one doesn’t bother me all that much.
gaming,The internet has chosen their movie to circlejerk. Most people are incapable of deciding on things for themselves
gaming,"Doesn’t mean it’s okay for almost every Triple-A/Big Company Game to throw in crappy Microtransactions/F2P P2W/Gimmicky downloads and charge for them. 

Games shouldn’t cost me $80 and then waggle a bunch of $5, $10, $25 Bonus Pack and bull crap skins. It’s stupid. Yes, you don’t *have* to buy it, but the average person will usually do it maybe a couple of times just because the option exists, and gives them some exclusive skin/look that they can also show off and brag about. It leaves people who don’t make purchases feel almost alienated from a certain group.

Usually you can earn everything through normal in-game playtime, or leveling up, but it’s usually much slower and spread out as you go. So they throw in the option “Hey, skip ahead a level for just a dollar! Buy this pack and get 6 level skips, it’s only 5 bucks man!”"
gaming,"One of the best games of all time
Played it everyday since launch
Worth every penny"
gaming,"Your submission has been removed because we do not allow redd.it link posts except for static images. Why? Our spam controls get screwed up by the v.redd.it domain.  Please use Youtube to host videos or imgur/gfycat for gifs, thanks!

gaming,"OG to me, a westerner"
gaming,Also why the fuck did they pick Gangsta's Paradise as the song. This entire thing feels like Hollywood is just trolling us.
gaming,his mouth is still gonna give me a nightmare
gaming,"yeah... but you need a texture pack to take full advantage. Vanilla texture dont (much?) have reflection data. In this video OP is using Vanilla Normals Renewed (I think 1.12.2, thats what I am experimenting with at least) another popular texture pack is ""Defult improved + PBR"". The shader pack and texture pack will bring an overclocked 2080ti to its knees. I am getting 30fps 1440p with both on and had to do a lot teaking to get 30fps. 

Honestly I would advice most Nivida gpu users to stick with the base SEUS shader pack. Its still amazing! has parralax support, and I think support 1.13 which the ray tracing pack does not."
gaming,"I almost hope they go for a setup for Sonic and Knuckles as the sequel. Post credits scene, Robotnik's all like ""The hedgehog caused all of this. All so he could steal your master emerald"" and it pans over to CGI abomination Knuckles."
gaming,"People go on about his teeth but the real creepy part is his weird, wet hyper realistic nose with nostrils"
gaming,I love me some Jim but the writing sounded awful in the trailer. I don’t think even he can save that.
gaming,I guess it's a fresh pasta. I'm flattered that you would call it a pasta at all.
gaming,If I’m gonna buying a pre build computer what should I look for?
gaming,"It's definitely an odd take, but no bullshit, I still really want to see this movie."
gaming,"Oh awesome! Looked it up and found their website, it looks like they do great pieces. Thanks for sharing :)"
gaming,Honestly I would love it
gaming,"You're kind of a weird one, huh?"
gaming,Its dwarf fortress i have spent enough time watching Joel play it to recognize it immediately
gaming,"I wished they made Sonic look more like Sonic. 

This thing looks like Tonic the dehydrated squirrel LOREAL used to test out its shampoo on. 

Jim Carrey is probably where the budget went for this. 

It has a very Rocky and Bullwinkle movie feel to it. And that's not a compliment."
gaming,"Yes, mecklejay that is what I meant"
gaming,lego batman is a beaut game
gaming,For king and country!
gaming,Omg. I think this is the best description of what’s wrong with sonic 😂
gaming,He looks like a kid who bought a sonic costume from Hot Topic.
gaming,"I fear no hedgehog, but that thing... it scares me."
gaming,Everyone knows Dota 2 is where it's at
gaming,"1v1 me monkey baseball, you won't"
gaming,"Yeah, he looks like a person in a furry costume."
gaming,Lmao his face is like I went from young Super-Man to this smh
gaming,Because Nike said so.
gaming,Hollywood: Cartoons are for babies so make a 3d monster for the kids.

gaming,Just get the normal version. You'll be able to get the DLC later on if you still care.
gaming,"Probably suicide attempt. They were serious, too - Down the lane, not across the road."
gaming,"It's not remotely new. Redstone has been a thing for a long time. Same with villagers. If you trap a farmer villager in the right way, you can rig it so he'll come out and plant plants for you and you collect the harvest. He'll go back inside and become trapped through the right setup and only be released once you harvest.

Or you could just build a tiered wheat aqueduct with pistons to release water that washes all your wheat/seeds into collectors, meaning all you have to do is plant the seeds after each harvest, but again you've built this thing in a fully protected area."
gaming,"No, I think it is going to theaters, but probably won't stay for longer than 2 weeks. I imagine whatever marvel movie is there will outsell it for months"
gaming,Came here for the Dunkey comments. Wasn't disappointed.
gaming,This is what people call a “movie made to appease a board of directors with zero movie making credentials”
gaming,"Fastest man in the world. “I need to get faster!”
“I wasn’t fast enough!”

Maybe try strategy. Also how do you lose fights with slow people. Take a judo class and maybe train boxing."
gaming,Probably because the literal Dr. Robotnik is funding this movie and wants to destroy our beloved Sonic memories. Only explanation.
gaming,If you didn’t jizz on them the sand wouldn’t stick to them so much
gaming,This reminds me of total annihilation. Rip :'(
gaming,This is Sonic... One Eye Ball and all
gaming,He’s a Vayne main through and through
gaming,"Okay, seriously Paramount:  Just fix the fucking face.  That's all I want. I can deal with the weird body, just fix the face."
gaming,TFW your mom gets you a Sonick the Hedgemon backpack from Chinatown
gaming,"I am so tired of these posts.  Don't fucking watch it of you don't like the style, or better yet, stop crucifying people and go enjoy a different style/telling of the character.  People are so childish."
gaming,Very clean but a little too much RGB. 5/7
gaming,Thing 1 and thing blue
gaming,Maybe it's like Attorneys General or Courts Martial when you're talking about plural instances :P
gaming,I try I guess
gaming,thank you so much:)
gaming,"Oh, now I get it.  Suck your mum and thanks."
gaming,"Toxicity ran me off. You literally get friends you get along with just fucking morphing on you in that DOTA shit. I'm sure it made *me* salty, too.

Left that shit behind and never looked back."
gaming,I think it'll be good. :)
gaming,That’s a lot better but still looks weird must be the Shoes
gaming,Yup he looks like a who lol
gaming,"&gt;Stop feeding the ADC!

Me, when im top, with plenty of kills as fiora and bot lane feeds a veigar up the ass"
gaming,Yeah lol I was thinking all day that he looked really familiar. Now I guess I know why .
gaming,It's on purpose. They don't care about any source material. They just want to make a soul-less junk-food movie for kids. Sonic looks like that because they're looking at the lowest common demoniator of theater goers. His body's fucking goofy looking because they don't want to spend anything beyond basic motion capture. It's just somebody wearing a suit with a green mask on so they can add in the face later.
gaming,"You mean ""gopher monkey kid"""
gaming,"How should it look, then?"
gaming,You're trying too hard
gaming,True i stopped playing around season 3 or 4. When they were getting rid of alternate builds such as ap yi
gaming,This picture smells like my childhood
gaming,I feel like this version took more effort to make than the good version would’ve.  Do less!
gaming,"Yeah, but Sonic fans have gotten used to accepting shit for at least 10 years. This is just par for the course at this point."
gaming,oh maybe that is why. I been trying to find the right game but never settled for one. Thanks you sooo much
gaming,"It’s all CGI anyways, why couldn’t they make it not creepy as shit in the first place?"
gaming,https://imgur.com/gallery/W7jZWZD I fixed it
gaming,"He wasn't wearing  his uniform in that scene. He probably heard some rustling around and thought it might be a wild animal. Boom,  explained!"
gaming,Super Mario was a childhood classic
gaming,Like a god damn mother fucking hedgehog
gaming,Tails is the voice actor for the new Sonic.
gaming,"Strange, refunded game on egs and they only ask (automatically) about transaction ID"
gaming,"Execs behind Sonic Movie:  ""this is the nightmare, boys!"""
gaming,I get that reference!
gaming,"Makes me think of this:

https://m.imgur.com/BDfVm"
gaming,"November right? That means it’s up against: Frozen 2, terminator dark fate and that mr Rogers movie.

Frozen 2 alone will murder it"
gaming,"I buy it.

In Tetris Attack, the title screen theme is a remix of a title screen from Yoshi's Island, and [the baby Yoshis ""sing"" it](https://youtu.be/qHshZtfeBns)...it sounds a *lot* like the soundfont instrument used for Yoshi's Island's Flower Garden track!"
gaming,Make monkey boy green and he could be child grinch.
gaming,It's all from /r/justfuckmyshitup
gaming,I was having an okay day.
gaming,That looks way better
gaming,"It is its spiritual successor so don't feel weird! 

They took a lot from chivalry but they definitely improved on the forumla quite a bit."
gaming,"Damn Tails you wild, wyd?"
gaming,Ouch I am so sorry for your loss. =/
gaming,That’s all that matters
gaming,"I hope Jim Carrey saves the movie and it's amazing. I want to see so many youtubers eat their words. I personally don't like how sonic looks, but I think people are blowing it out of proportion for YouTube views and karma. I'm actually more upset that Dr. Robotnik is not a fat ass."
gaming,Literally the only thing they got right is his hair and ears... that's really embarrassing.
gaming,Or he could be beast boy
gaming,Could a Sonic movie ever be good?
gaming,Why does Sonic look somewhat like James Marsden
gaming,Or the green ranger in the new Power Rangers movie...that wasnt green lit.
gaming,Oh we all know
gaming,Still old school in my eyes. Pokemon died when they stopped naming the versions after colours. Which I'm guessing is a total coincidence.
gaming,These adaptations are getting out of hand
gaming,"Frozen 2 will be in theaters for like 6 months, like Captain Marvel is still in theaters and it came out in November."
gaming,At least it's art
gaming,And a preverted pyschopath
gaming,This makes me think of mike wazouzki being watched
gaming,Wowwwww why is this so much better? This would make the whole thing more bearable.
gaming,I don't like this trailer.... ima have to down vote this
gaming,?/10 till you say what game is in there
gaming,"I think they were trying to be truer to the animal sonic is based off of. Tbh as a kid, I used to be surprised seeing actual hedgehogs after seeing sonic first. Now, it’ll be a less jarring experience for the new generation"
gaming,He can play a good eggman the problem is sonic looking like hes an STD baby
gaming,I always find larger fov footage from pc games make my head spin from that tunnel effect.
gaming,And everyone is going around talking about how Triss tricked him. This story is a lot more messed up then I thought
gaming,Titanfall 2. it’s like 4.50 USD rn
gaming,I'm glad at least one person got it :)
gaming,"QUICKLY! THE HOLIDAYS ARE COMING!

To be fair though unleashed wasnt bad, it was just different."
gaming,it's not work fuck off
gaming,"This was all kinda funny at first but now the internet is just being insufferably negative because they want the same attention all the other memes are getting. 

Anyway I can’t wait to see this movie. I’ve been a sonic fan for like 24 years. The fact that a movie even exists is dope and y’all just need to let people enjoy things"
gaming,Have you not seen Game of Thrones? Melisandre?
gaming,You mean record long Nike commercial
gaming,I said the same thing. I was like - his legs aren't that long. And Dr. Robotnik was fat - so... lots of confusion...
gaming,You're asking us if a game you already purchased at a discount is fun? Also /r/untrustworthypoptarts
gaming,Reading this made me want to take a shower.
gaming,Wonder who he mains
gaming,"You may ""kontinue"" XD"
gaming,"Is the one on the left how they animated him for the movie?

That looks awful.

I can't render anything at all with computer graphics, so I can't claim to be able to do better, but that's really bad."
gaming,And DeVito was almost the voice of Pikachu in Detective Pikachu.
gaming,We have got to work on your ability to check context clues: /
gaming,I want this so i can just drive through an area where LoL players be hanging out.
gaming,"SnooPING AS usual, I see?"
gaming,"People just  want to hate the movie because their precious sanic, doesn't look the way they wanted him to. Personally the movie looked intriguing to me and I was not interested at all before but I love speedsters. If the whole movie is just a long quicksilver scene, I'll be happy."
gaming,"I don't think anyone's still playing it, if that helps? I really liked that game, but those gimmick attacks were a pain in the ass. Killing someone who used them was satisfying, but didn't make up for the frustration."
gaming,The final Xenoverse 2 DLC is pretty fun with branching quest lines. Bring Captain Ginyu as your master. He's hilarious.
gaming,Knack destroyed League.... HERE COMES THE MONEY!
gaming,I lost my legend of Zelda 4 season cartridge to battery loss last month so I feel you bro
gaming,And he has a piece of the fur/dna and make robo sonic or shadow

gaming,Because league is a video game. Not a public forum.
gaming,Nike and Puma's decision.
gaming,"Seriously though, these people... it's blatantly obvious. https://imgur.com/V5JgkwF.jpg"
gaming,"Because some studio exec/producer/director has an absurdly massive (yet absurdly fragile) that makes them want to make their ""mark"" on the movie they are working on regardless of whether it hurts the final product.  Alternately, it's possible that they used ""focus groups"" to kill the movie by committee."
gaming,Push A once then spam B
gaming,Sonic is incredibly near and dear to my heart and i just have no way of expressing how fucking ignorant it is of the producers/creators of this movie to make Sonic look absolutely NOTHING like Sonic.
gaming,"Sega has been giving away the rights to sonic since they weren't a fucking console anymore, lol."
gaming,"I *WANT* to start playing again, but I haven't played since season 3 and I was d1 50+ LP. Everything is different now, even champions I used to main. Usually give up after a game or two of being confused as hell about what every champion does."
gaming,"Hair needs to be more prominent, eyes need to be bigger and more angled too. Also I don’t think that expression on the top left looks like anything sonic would make."
gaming,Jim Carrey is the saving Grace for me
gaming,"I've never seen the second one. I was like 15 when the first one came out, and the hugest Christopher Lambert nerd. I didn't even know he was in it. Man I loved that movie so much!"
gaming,Sanic teh horge heg.
gaming,"Very simplistic, I like it :)"
gaming,Pretty sure Sonic has become a joke since Nintendo acquired his rights simply to make him look bad
gaming,"His eyes I could live with. His creepy human teeth I could live with. His weirdly proportioned limbs I could live with. 

But why does he have a hyper realistic, giant nostrilled, WET nose."
gaming,How are you liking Fi on that S10+?
gaming,"Am I the only one who thinks he looks fine? Serviceable at least? Everyone's talking about how this basically ruined their childhood, but honestly he could've been a lot worse"
gaming,"Lots of negativity towards the trailer, but my 10 year old sure liked it."
gaming,Hey..... thanks for the free parking.....
gaming,Dark Souls 3 Season Pass
gaming,As much as I hate Sonic's design I hate Jim Carry as Eggman even more.
gaming,Modern problems require modern solutions

gaming,"""but it's different from the source"" that is not an excuse to claim the movie is going to suck. stop being so stubborn. outrage porn is all the fuckin rage now-a-days fuck. get over it. jim carrey made me laugh in that trailer. who knows maybe he becomes fat some point later in the movie. maybe an experiment gone wrong."
gaming,"Just get under cover, prone when you need to. It takes a little bit of luck, too. A lot of the game feels impossible but most is luck based I think, along with figuring out the safest strategies."
gaming,Are we doing game canon or book canon.
gaming,Me too!  Yummy yummy 😋

gaming,He looks like Sonic and Tales got mashed together.
gaming,So it’s like Maria from the Silent Hill HD Collection?
gaming,I've been getting back into it a bit after a hiatus of about 2 years. I find it more fun now that I don't care nearly as much about it.
gaming,"Pretty good. Not as good as on one of the ""made for fi phones,"" but I hardly miss the other features."
gaming,Look how they massacred my boy
gaming,I was wondering where tf I seen this before lool what I dont get is why it looks like sonic has really soft fur
gaming,"Yo sonic, I got one question for you:



WHAT ARE THOOOOOOOOOOOSE?!

WHAT. ARE. THOSE?!"
gaming,First time playing a CoD game on veteran? You definitely wouldn't have survived Cod 2s hill 400 level. Fuck that shit
gaming,Isn't it just galactic basic or something
gaming,outrage porn is all the rage now-a-days
gaming,"Warframe. They’re always adding new stuff, constantly, and there are options for everybody. Dozens of different weapons, classes, and abilities."
gaming,You didn't play Mania?
gaming,Where can I buy this?!?
gaming,"If you can't make a good movie, then make it so bad, so cheesy, so stupid that people will hate it and go see it so they can talk about how they survived it like it was Armageddon. Ez monies"
gaming,And he's a blue talking hedgehog
gaming,Borderlands 2 makes you FEEL like an ocd hoarder on your best violent killing spree. And fuck those truxicans!
gaming,Bruh no he looks like the cat in the hat cat
gaming,Something tells me this guy was done being hardstuck silver
gaming,I think it's the arms.
gaming,I honestly think the game is dogshit but so many people love to play it. I've played like 10-15 games max and think it's pure trash.

gaming,Cursed image for sure
gaming,Now I just wish we got shoe companies hiring athletes to team up with cartoons.
gaming,"From what I could gather, the mages in the Witcher universe has permanent reconstruction, but it can be reversed again with magic. Melisandre's trick is closer to a disguise or veil than anything."
gaming,My brother wears slides and that’s how he always walks around in them.
gaming,Yeah I remember crazy taxi and twisted metal had no glitches whatsoever.
gaming,I think sonic looks fine. I don’t understand why everyone is so butthurt
gaming,Eh it's one of 'em
gaming,"Baby zombies are actually one of the most dangerous mobs due to how small and fast they are, so this doesn't surprise me at all really."
gaming,Most Dreamcast issues are easily fixed. Rebooting itself? Bend the power supply pins. Only turns on for a second? Replace the fan. Doesn't read discs? Adjust the pot or the whole laser assembly (1 piece). Clock doesn't stick? Replace the 3V rechargeable battery.
gaming,Sounds and looks about gay

gaming,"Its true. I'm currently on a 0-6 losing streak. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yet here I am, in queue right now."
gaming,Because they paid for Jim Carrey. Hollywood.
gaming,Don't threaten me with a good time.
gaming,"There used to be one, the Xperia Play."
gaming,No one is claiming that. It’s totally banking on nostalgia (and the fact that it’s geared towards kids) because so far Sonic looks awful. That’s the feeling around here.
gaming,Maybe they were thinking it might show how much of a shit show the real Normandy landing was
gaming,Would it be cheaper to animate with a more anthropomorphic character? Then you can use those dudes with little balls on their spandex.
gaming,"Tons of kids no who sonic is, lol. Are you joking here?"
gaming,IIRC she does worse in the books.
gaming,Is that a whovillian or Night crawler?
gaming,Is the one on the left the actual thing? It looks like it belongs in /r/badtaxidermy
gaming,This was a character in Undertale.
gaming,"The 90s and that style of humor is dead. Ask Will Ferrell about Sherlock and how well that worked out for him. 

They don’t make those kinds of movies with that kind of humor anymore for a reason. It isn’t popular anymore."
gaming,No but they’re ignorant
gaming,Lazy mouth results in a southern accent.

gaming,"There are the 3 base gameplays

FPS   (Black ops,fortnite, pubg)

3rd person follow camera (Assasins Creed, gta)

Side / top scroller (vintage stuff)

There hasnt been a new base gameplay mechanic in a long while.  


The physics engines and graphics are the only thing that anyone cares about so they apply them to these basics.  Theres nothing else to innovate on unless you completely break out and try to use multiple ones (think paper mario) 

Or Theres always VR..."
gaming,I was thinking that crossed with Night Crawler
gaming,"Looks like they hired a meme artist and a furry artist to design him. When the artists were done they couldn’t decide what was “better” so they did something from both concepts.

You know its bad when my fiancee, who has no frame of reference for how he is supposed to look, finds him a little “off.”"
gaming,Where that sonic kid at? We need him
gaming,It doesn’t make sense. They should have made it a cutscene because it’s so unplayable. Terrible way to begin to game.
gaming,Lock the doors and close the blinds we're going for a ride~
gaming,"I personally found that with Driveclub.
Yes, there are way too many vertical slices being shown."

gaming,No one hates League more than League players.
gaming,"Yup. 


I've got the joy joy joy joy down in my heart.."
gaming,And those aren’t the only vertebrates. My wife tells me that she likes how *Greg* has a spine.
gaming,"To be fair, they should certainly judge Triss too. She's the sweeter human being but she knows of Geralt's history with Yennefer and refuses to tell him post amnesia because she can keep him for herself that way. It's a highly immoral thing to do.

Morality is all over the place in their stories. Also I've just checked, at least two of the books are openly on youtube. If you google for the right order to listen in (you can skip the short stories ones if necessary, though they're also great reading/listening) then I'd highly recommend giving them a shot. I loved the politics of the North/South and all those goings on as much as I did Geralt and his story. The North only won the war against Nilfgaard because a few scouts failed to go over a hill and fully check for opposing troops, on the other side of the hill sat a full league of Redanian cavalry.

There's also a great bit about the Dwarves being totally abused in general with less pay, worse rations and the worst tasks on the battlefield. They're under attack as the worst part of the line and are asked to go further and reinforce elsewhere despite on the verge of being overwhelmed. They literally up formation from their holding phalanx and march a fully ordered phalanx around the battlefield under constant attack. Brilliant little bit that conjures some great imagery."
gaming,He'll play Tryndamere mid and wonder why his team always loses.

gaming,"Now I'm convinced he's going to put on goggles at some epic moment and look exactly as we'd like, but they don't want to spoil it in the trailer."
gaming,"The only issue I have with Made for Fi phones is that the network always switched to Sprint and never changed, always had to force it back to T-Mobile. Decided to just use unlocked or T-Mobile phones."
gaming,"Most of the time, when games are shown at E3, they aren't even finished yet, and a lot of changes can happen during development. Tbh people would probably be more disappointed if they saw gameplay on E3 but the game itself turned out to be different."
gaming,"This is not going to be a popular opinion, but I never liked sonic. I was In the Mario camp 100% growing up."
gaming,You can’t even unlimited sprint😂 worst part of any cod game. Such a poor decision on the game developer’s part.
gaming,He’s probably a hardcore lol player too
gaming,I still have hope that the universe will somehow break itself and this turns out to be a good movie.

gaming,Playing right now and can confirm the validity of that statement
gaming,"A furry in a fursuit would have looked better. You can actually make fursuit pretty damn good with a big enough budget.

This is just tragedy"
gaming,Unpopular opinion but I'd like to see it. All y'all hating on this movie probably LOVED the Super Mario Brothers movie when it came out with those weird goombas.

gaming,I disagree but I'm a degenerate kha'zix main so what do I know
gaming," I'm saying his teeth because they're so human-like, something about that just makes me uneasy."
gaming,It’s a movie based on a 20 year old franchise. Are you just going to ignore that there is an adult fan base for Sonic?
gaming,"Really, that's your only issue? I just got bored of the game after a couple evenings. Repetitively boring."
gaming,"&gt; Can't take any frames from my game because I don't have that good of specs 

encoding video (and audio) realtime is one of the most taxing things you can ask a computer to do.  if you have poor specs already, forget trying to record on the same box."

gaming,Uhh extreamly recently actually. Sonic mania was massively popular.
gaming,Its actually a Dota player lol
gaming,"I agree, they should have made Sonic look like Sonic."
gaming,"Sonic looks fucking ignorant....not sure why it would have so hard to stick to his original features with how well they can do CGI these days. 
Dumb. His look was botched. Jim Carrey looks great as Egg Man."

gaming,This is gonna be the new Pikachu meme
gaming,Depends on your budget. That is the single largest factor that dictates what your choices are.
gaming,WELL TODAY'S YOUR LUCKY DAY!!!
gaming,"All just depends on what your playing. If your playing a simple fps like cod you just gotta get used to looking at your mini map and peeking your corners. If your playing battlefield you gotta learn the weapon mechanics, some guns are good aiming down sights some are horrible and have to be hip fired. More objective team based games like overwatch and rainbow six siege are more about learning characters and maps. Most fps games are in reality all the same ""shoot to kill"". All it takes is time and learning mechanics of said game and eventually you'll be on your way to playing better and even having strategies of your own. Best of luck in your journeys friend"
gaming,Thanks for having my back and all other weirdos out there haha
gaming,"They were thinking ""Let's make this just as impossible as the thought of storming head first into machine gun fire with little cover""

Did you expect it to be a cakewalk? Good on them for making it somewhat realistic."
gaming,"I feel alone in mildly liking Super Mario Bros. It felt like a different universe than the game of course, but how many Batman's are we going to see?"
gaming,Just pretend that this is the time the studios will have put out a psych-out trailer that makes people think the movie is about something its not.
gaming,The part where Jim shocks himself with a sonic hair had me bust out laughing.
gaming,Everyone here talking about sonic when dr. Robotnik is just as far from the game as physically possible.
gaming,It really is the weird human body. Like how do you make the head proportion right but draw a line at the hands and feet.
gaming,"the run will never be impressive the game is designed for children to play it, actually its impressive he didn't get bored of that single world."
gaming,They still teach cursive writing?
gaming,That didn't stop Sharknado.
gaming,"Mass Effect? Not post apocalyptic but alien worlds. So similar? If you squint..

Squint harder."
gaming,"I guess. After you get past this first level there's gonna be a lot more scenarios where you're gonna be like what the actual fuck for a long time, just stay cool and think of the safest ways to clear each section. Who to kill first, where to move, what teammate assist things to call and when, etc."
gaming,"Hollywood giveth, but Hollywood also taketh away."
gaming,That movie was one of the highlights of my childhood. It was cheesy in the best kind of way.
gaming,"Gimme Dune II and we're golden.

Actually, believe it or not, there was an N64 C&amp;C cartridge, and that's where most of my memories of this game are from.

But Dune II is the OG and don't you fucking forget it. 

RIP Westwood."

gaming,Shani should have been an option that wasn't a dead end!
gaming,"Triss and Yen, both truly love Gerald and he loves them aswell, but Triss is manipulative, she wants to shape him into something he isn't is (like getting him to settle down, lay off the witcher being and start a family in Kovir). This starts in the books and Follows up in the games. Also even though she is aware of Geralds relationship with Yen, she still exploits this, by starting an affair with him. Yen loves him the way he is, she would not dare trying to change his character. Also she is cold at the beginning because they haven't seem each other for multiple years, and she is super pissed at Gerald for his affair in W1 and W2.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!One thing to mention in the game. If you played W2 you can give Triss the ""Rose of Remembrance"" a rose, that blooms as long as the gifter and the gifted truly love each other. You can find the rose in Triss' abandoned house in Novigrad still blooming.!&lt;"
gaming,That’s a true rage quitter
gaming,Well your kids are an exception since they've seen the original. How many other kids can say the same? Not many.
gaming,"It is by far worse, but SFW so it has that going on."
gaming,That’s the problem. You can’t kill anyone on the first level. Your only option is to run and then it makes you stop sprinting after 3 seconds
gaming,Still debating based on reviews. Hearing fecent stuff from player base however. Does it get quite repetitive quickly as mentioned in most reviews or are ya finding it enjoyable?
gaming,Super Mario Bros is a goddamn treasure.
gaming,Antsy. There's a difference between spiderman &amp; deadpool.
gaming,Or he's in the Mushroom Kingdom and this is the first scene of the Smash Bros. extended universe.
gaming,I have seen GOT but as it wasn’t touched on in the game I had assumed those sorceresses in the Witcher 3 just aged slowly. There was nothing to tell me it was any kind of trick.
gaming,Sonic and Sega all stars has some kickass tracks
gaming,"Compared to the movie, even Sonic 06 seems nice.

*mindblown* oh. My. God. They wanted to make something so awfull that their other failures wont look as bad! THIS IS GENIUS /s"

gaming,He looks like he's doing well
gaming,Thanks. I’ll give those a listen. Maybe if they make a fourth I’ll actually be able to understand what’s going on
gaming,"It's a lot, that much is true.  I skip back a lot with physical copies of books too.  I have a problem where I'll read things and I'll just be going through the motion of reading it and it won't log into my memory at all.  I passively watch a lot of shows while doing other things so I imagine an audio book could be similar, in that I have to go ""woah wait how did they get here?"""

gaming,Sega will release a new console with a new exclusive 3d Sonic game with a soundtrack scored by Limp Bizkit and Vanilla Ice.
gaming,"I mean it's an RPG for a reason, doesn't mean he's necessarily into that. It's just an interesting outcome. And Geralt does kinda come across as a womanizer sometimes, at least in the game."
gaming,"And really. Everyone starts somewhere. 
Everyone giving you grief was just as bad if not worse. 
It's why I usually turn voice chat off in any game I play. 
I don't mind picking up the slack of a newer or less experienced player. That's why it's a team. Lol"
gaming,"I dont wanna play games with someone who smells bad enough to make my eyes water. All I ask is that you shower the same day and wear clean clothes. BO is fine, people sweat, but I dont wanna smell your ass from 10 feet away."
gaming,"Definitely the one with the most character for sure, never felt dull the entire time"
gaming,Can someone please tell me wtf they were thinking?
gaming,That was the fucking best back then
gaming,Sonic has survived over a decade of mediocre to bad games on the strength of his design and they fucked it up completely.
gaming,So I don't have a Satellite of Love in my basement.
gaming,looks like he ends up a fatass at the end. Maybe sonic is what made him an absolute unit.
gaming,Oh my is that brow unfurrowed? If only just a little?
gaming,Also dislikes short nails.
gaming,Fuck me now I’m taking a shower
gaming,Oh right let me fix it. I forgot the third gen is called Xbox one lol how out of tune I am with gaming
gaming,At least the Mario bros had the decency to wear pants.
gaming,Hedgehogs have quills not hair
gaming,"We need a full cgi rendition of sonic stat for the new trailer.... sir if we just reuse the monkey boy from jumanji and add a little more hair we could save the studio thousands. 

-Paramount sonic boardmeeting-"
gaming,I had no problem with the sprinting. literally follow the instructions and take cover behind the hedgehogs and inside the impact craters.
gaming,That’s a really good point. I’ll leave my post up without edit but I think you’ve just shut my whole argument down.
gaming,Fornite isn’t an FPS

gaming,wheres his dick tho
gaming,"This is very true. As a kid, I actually enjoyed the dystopian Total Recall universe of Super Mario Bros The Movie. Call it a guilty pleasure, but I loved that movie, and found the darker storyline refreshing compared to the Super Mario Bros Super Show that was on TV.  I loved Spawn to death too, but it seems like the critics forgot that movie was ever made as soon as Black Panther hit the scene. 

The way she goes Bubs!"
gaming,"Adults, That want to see a live action sonic movie. Yes, I am going to ignore them"
gaming,"Same, this is why I never really pay attention to reviews"
gaming,"The books make everything crystal clear, if this helps. A final point, in the scene in the game when Geralt finds Ciri with the Seven Dwarves you have the option of asking her about several things from the past or just general curiosities. All of those are stories from the book that are fully fleshed out, you get Ciri's rebellious street gang years (hence the tattoo, a previous romance with a young woman) and other such things. I played through the game a second time on Death March post all the books and everything made sense to me then."
gaming,why does it look like anime porn ?

gaming,"You cant convince me that whatever the heñl its this thing, its not just a guy in a furry suit"
gaming,my latest BFH gameplay
gaming,"If they would have made the anime like this and currently used it for the new movie coming up, I would be way satisfied. I can't believe this was released in the 90s! And seems way better.

However I do like this style of animation stand it's still interesting to see this new type of Sonic. Just wish his proportions and everything still fits the animation style rather than try to come up with this realistic body shape of a person over an animal."
gaming,Oooohhhhh shiiiit... I never knew!
gaming,"Okay, then Sega did it wrong back in '91."
gaming,"Everyone shitting on it today brings me huge nostalgia lol yes it was a terrible movie, but that was its charm. Kinda like Hulk Hogan in SuburbanCommando and Mr. Nanny haha"
gaming,"Yeah, T-Mobile network is treating me pretty well. It's good stuff."
gaming,"It’s almost like a nice, blue version of satan."
gaming,"Hop wasn’t a completely terrible movie, maybe it’s just because I liked everyone in it."
gaming,"He's looking like he's taking care of himself, at least showering. Lost some weight though. And that cosmetic surgery he got makes him look like a fucking suicidal mouse"
gaming,"If you have to ask, then you aren’t ready for the answer."
gaming,Mark my words. His mustache will end up being frizzed by the electric powers Sonic apparently has now.
gaming,I showed my 6 year old the trailer because she loves Sonic and all she had to say is “ that Sonic sucks!”
gaming,"Sonic as a brand is built almost entirely on character design. I doubt the average person could give a detailed explanation of the story or even describe most of the personalities of the characters, since both change so often. However, most people would recognize the style, and the district and unique design of each character is what people recognize and cherish. 

This movie is drop kicking all that into the sun and relying on Jim Carrey to be funny enough to pull the film along. I haven't even seen the full trailer yet (or played a Sonic game) and yet I already know I'll be rooting for the villain because he is not only Jim Carrey, but simply by being a human, is the closest thing to the source material in terms of style in the movie."
gaming,"If reposters really cared about sharing to those who may have not seen it before than they would give credit to the source or at the very least the oldest example of the content they could find.    The reality is reposters have zero care and just want to farm karma.

This is why Reddit and the community should change how reposts are handled and treated,    The option should be present to  check off a box of a repost.   If the box is checked  the post earns no karma to the users profile  but it could still be potentially highly exposed on the Subreddit.     Those who fail to check the box will be challenged by a auto reverse image search  and if caught will have to go check the box.   If a reposter manages to get around this intentionally the account should be barred from posting content."
gaming,Doing a lot worse doesn't mean this is fine. The design looks like crap. .
gaming,And buttholes like puckered mouths.
gaming,"The logic is that if the face is too stylized, you can't just do 1:1 mocap."
gaming,"Oh yea definitely, he looks terrible it’s so sad"
gaming,What an asshole answer. Ok Mr. I'm too mature for everyone
gaming,"Yeah, but I wanted to see Jim Carrey playing Eggman, not Jim Carrey playing Jim Carrey."
gaming,Probably. Razer roughly translates to ‘tri-fang’ in Latin by the way.
gaming,I think you are mistaken. This is Dr. Robotnik.
gaming,Most definitely a yes
gaming,Click bait and stupid.
gaming,That’s a fucking who from grinch idc what you say
gaming,The folks over at r/buildapcforme can set you right up
gaming,it's what an actual hedgehog looks like... do we really need to get mad about this or just see how the movie turns out
gaming,why couldn’t they see pikachu and think gee maybe we should change sonic before releasing this?
gaming,"Also, Sonic's design is goofy as shit. Big head, feet, and hands with skinny legs and arms. In a live-action movie with a CGI Sonic, using the original design would have made it look like some Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Space Jam type shit."
gaming,"I just got Sonic Mania two weeks ago.  So happy it's such a good game!  ""Do I really want to spend $20 for disappointment? Oh hey, it doesn't suck"""
gaming,This isn't even the worst form of this. It's the owl in Ocarina of Time.
gaming,I never noticed the nike ad on the shoes until now omg what if the reason they did this as to put the nike symbol on realistic looking shoes.
gaming,"I've been collecting for about 22 years now so yeah, I've got a few more than two."

Definition of so terrible it became awesome."
gaming,Logical increments for buying parts and building pcs.
gaming,"Sonic isn't even that popular with kids these days, so that won't do much either."
gaming,Thanks! Didn’t know there was a whole subreddit for naming games!
gaming,Wha the fuck have they done with Dr. Eggman
gaming,"Just don't put him next to real actors, simple. 

Why this wasn't an animated feature after his successful cameo in Wreck it Ralph I'll never know. Sonic is perfect for the family friendly market. Colourful and cartoony, strong environmentalist themes, simple story and great soundtracks"
gaming,But wait! HE ISN'T DEAD! SHIA SURPRISE!!!
gaming,I guess their only hope is that this somehow becomes a cult hit?
gaming,"Actually I'm in my mid 30s and several of my friends and co-workers said they thought it looked fun and wanted to see it in the theaters. So, no, not everyone."
gaming,This. I am super excited for the movie.
gaming,Do you really think the movie is going to be that bad? It does look like it will be better than a b rated movie.
gaming,"I used to play that shit all the time with my sister when I was younger. I think 10 year olds and under are already covered in plenty of germs as is, I doubt that made any difference"

gaming,It’s amazing how some Hollywood directors just don’t fucking get it when it comes to video games. They just don’t make any damn effort to even try.
gaming,Am I missing something? Are you intentionally replacing those 'c's with 'k's?
gaming,oh shit I forgot about that one lol
gaming,One had this obscure Sonic Heroes multiplayer arcade cabinet thingy I can’t find any information on. Every good play place was remodeled.

gaming,Yes! Great game. Been really hoping Ubi would make another.
gaming,8.5 out of 10. No headphone jack and apparently volume buttons. Overall great setup I think you should invest in a miniature mouse as well.

Competition breeds toxic behavior."
gaming,They replaced it with insufferabilty
gaming,"I'm around 10-12 hours in and it doesn't seem to be repetitive. Yah there's plenty of outposts and freaker nests scattered across the map. And while the task is the same, each outpost and nest present themselves with different positional challenges. The devs took alot of time in the details of the map and enviornment itself. Everything seems to have a purpose. Every thing from the placement of wrecked vehicles to the placement of garbage on the street seems to be planned."
gaming,"I think this is trying to market to the parents who had a Sega Genesis, literally was a bullet point ""Genesis"", in some awkward nemesis joke, and I feel weird saying this, Jim Carrey is also that actor the same age group  ""now late 20's to late mid 40's"" that also grew up with him.  Thinking of it as a business, the choices make sense, will I see this in theatre, fuck no, but will I watch it online for free ""when I'm at a friend's house and he bought it on Amazon prime"" yes, as soon as it's Blu-ray quality."
gaming,and always end up burning you?

I've heard an even split of tomayto and tomahto, but I've never heard anyone says potahto."
gaming,Why does that look like thing 1 and thing 2 from the cat in the hat
gaming,Both. Broken apart. A part of a broken apart toy.
gaming,There are literally 3 hedgehogs and 2 impact craters. I know it’s not impossible as I keep getting very close and dying at the last second but this doesn’t seem worth it. I just want to play a fun game on Veteran difficulty and this is not that.

*EDIT: His current game of choice is LOL."
gaming,An abomination unto the Emperor. Purify it.
gaming,Honestly I dont see the big deal about the design. 99% of average movie goers dont even care or know the character well enough that something is off with the model. Why does it even matter?

gaming,I’m glad I could provide the idea. Seems like a cool way to share your work with others.

gaming,You're not even kidding.
gaming,"By request, I recorded them seeing it...but it wasn't that great.  My ex told them to behave because I was going to record it, so the surprise was kinda ruined.  Wasn't just these stations that I built for them over the weekend either.  I did them a set of bunk beds and another multiplayer game station that houses their WiiU and Switch consoles/controllers/etc.  (Not the games though, they have a separate area)"

gaming,The more you guys chat shit the more upvotes I get hehehe karma obtained chief
gaming,"Oh wow that the best reimagining I've seen so far that isn't just a straight copy of the game version. 

It fixes everything wrong with the movie version while being unique from the games. I'd still prefer a full animated movie over live action but this is great for what the original was trying to be"
gaming,Looks like real life. Just replace the psp with phones.

gaming,"Hey now,  we've all done dumb shit at work away some point."
gaming,"Sonic is on YouTube and I’m sure it’s on Hulu or Netflix or one of the platforms out there. Kids can find it without their parents having an influence. I saw the trailer, it seemed like a movie directed at kids. 
I’m not saying it wouldn’t be more lucrative to direct it at both audiences. I m just saying that this particular movie is a kids thing. 
I think the design bothers people because it’s not the one they’re used to."
gaming,"I've been saying this all over reddit and no one cared, till now."
gaming,Instead they gave him the demeanour and physique of Winnie the Pooh
gaming,I ventured to Sonic for an ocean water.

gaming,Disney wouldn’t do that they’d get it right
gaming,"Did people think Double Dragon was that bad? That's actually one of the better video game adaptations imo. 

Don't get me wrong; it's not great. But it's not Mario Bros. bad.

This Sonic movie, though, this looks Mario Bros. bad."

My bad for mixing up the two :("

gaming,looks really dumb Oo
gaming,"Not really, I believe it was a Puyo Puyo game just reskinned to be tied to the Sonic franchise, but Puyo Puyo was not owned by Sega until 1998, 5 years after Mean Bean Machine came out... which is kind of fitting that Sega bought the franchise after and gave the development to Team Sonic.

Either way if you want to be accurate the you can say Puyo Puyo ripped off Dr. Mario a year after it was released ;)"
gaming,Yeah. Jim Cummings and Frank Welker are freakin wizards when it comes to voice manipulation.

gaming,Nike not having it
gaming,"CS has no competition? Overwatch, Siege, PUBG, Fortnite?

Dota copied League how? By adding talents that make a deep game deeper? 

Of course Valve would like it if DotA somehow became the most popular moba but I can guarantee you they never expected it, nor considered putting in the work to make it so. They knew they were developing a much more complicated game and the niche would be smaller. Maybe part of them thought that all the old dota 1 players would flock to dota 2 but Im sure that thought was extinguished pretty quickly. 

Now dota makes a good amount of money on it's own, but its also just an excellent way to get people to download steam and buy games. Valve realizes this and that is why they put on the most prestegious esports event of the year- to get people to try dota, but more importantly install steam."

gaming,I kind of do.
gaming,"Yeah here's a version without a connected eye that still fixes Sonic: https://i.imgur.com/MD6GWdI.jpg

gaming,That is cute. I’ll have to play W2.
gaming,"Im ok with this, but we don’t speak about sonic"
gaming,It pays great homage to the old 2D sonic games while adding in some new mechanics as well as pretty good level design that allows for more playthroughs because of different ways you can go about the levels. As an old school sonic fan you will feel right at home playing it. It was primarily made by people who were big into sonic when they were younger and wasn't actually made by Team Sonic. It isn't too long which is my only critizism of it.
gaming,"I’m too poor to give you gold, will you take this: 🥇"
gaming,"It got a good beat and a catchy chorus, which was all they used. The trailer was cut to match the music; I'm pretty musically ignorant but even with  that I still recognised that the music matched well with what was shown, as the trailer get more action the music also increase in action. If you ignore the context of the song, yeah, it works.


Though obviously you can't ignore something as iconic as Gangta's Paradise, so ... Again, they only had the beat and the chorus, but I feel like people who know Gangta's Paradise would know what the song is about and that'd ruin the experience for those people. That said that's gonna be a pretty big demographic cuz, it's freaking Gangsta's Paradise.

The bigger problem for me though is *not* using any of the songs in Sonic's great soundtrack library. While I did say that the music worked well with the flow of the trailer, that's because they cut the trailer to fit the music, and they could've done that with any songs instead of picking one with very specific well-known and serious messages."

gaming,"I think the movie will be fun. And tbh, it's made for kids, not 30y/o butthurt weenies."
gaming,"I’ve spammed hours of split screen with my best mate on Outward. I actually love the “you are a normal NPC adventurer” style of game that it is. 

That being said I recently got Dragons Dogma Dark Arisen on the Switch and have barely put it down for 3 days. 

I would say as a single player game with more exciting combat Dragons Dogma is the game for you. But if you like a chill but difficult RPG, especially one you can play with a friend, try Outward.  At $30 each you might as well get both."
gaming,Same thing when I watch porn just skipping skipping skipping then wondering how she got a 10inch stuck in her asshole time to go back and find out
gaming,Portal? (Or maybe something similar to it). That could help her get familiar with the concept of fps controls and it's a great game too.
gaming,Triss is a sexual predator...
gaming,"That's the only respectful response to my comment yet. Do you have experience in league? Cause I feel its rewarding, and after playing for years I am miles and miles ahead of when I started playing. But I can totally see why you would say that. It's strange because I love hard games, games that make most people turn away at first glance. Perhaps I am just spoiled by how smooth and streamlined league is, making dota just seem so janky. I do respect the game more than Heroes of the storm especially after getting diamond after my first month playing that game. I played probably 100 hours of dota and just never felt the love."
gaming,i thought his resemblance was because of the [whoville characters](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/0f/01/2a/0f012a8923c1d254c4da1cb5de84429d.jpg) from Jim carrys movies.
gaming,"I agree. If they made Sonic look like what they did in Wreck it Ralph, it probably wouldn't be getting half the hate it's getting now."
gaming,Why. Is. his. Goddamn. teeth. So. HUMANLIKE.
gaming,No no no please don't down vote me! What shall I ever do!?
gaming,You can’t love league of legends if you don’t hate the ever living fuck outta the game at the same time
gaming,"Halo is easier because you don’t have to aim down the sights. I suggest getting an Xbox Game Pass trial and downloading MCC for the campaigns. Maybe the Modern Warfare remastered campaign. She can start with recruit and then bump up difficulty as she gets better. No MP until she has the feel down since it will discourage her.

The Xbox controller is better for FPS movement because of the stick placement but the DualShock 4 is better for smaller hands. 

Either way she will get the hang of it in a couple of weeks!"
gaming,Nah that was just straight up awesome. Like the dungeons and dragons movie
gaming,lol now as an adult this and walmart video game section is nasty but as a kid that was the shit while parents ordered food or were shoping
gaming,"I don't understand. Why would they do this? How did even one person think this was ok, much less all the way up the ladder comprising the gaggle of clowns who make these things be? This is instead a thing that should not be. I want that absurs monstrosity put into a meat grinder."
gaming,"If you liked the classic Sonic games you'll like Sonic Mania. It's a strong return to form. I'm not as certain you'll like it if your only a fan of the adventure games or the 3D sonic games. Those were completely different games. You'll still probably like it, because it's a solid game, but I won't guarantee anything."
gaming,"It's written on ships in Sonic The Hedgehog 2, which released less than 2 years after the first."
gaming,Haha it’s from Malcolm in the Middle. https://youtu.be/HUxbnadlIz4
gaming,what about that trailer made you think they were holding anything back?
gaming,"Dragons Dogma. It also has a little bit of Replayability, especially if you're a completionist"
gaming,"Unless you're looking to get into shooters right away, then you could try Farcry or something."
gaming,What if it’s blood
gaming,Reminds me of when someone fixed Michael Bay's Ninja Turtles look to look like the [80s cartoon](https://i.imgur.com/dXMziLO.jpg). It's almost as if a movie entirely meant to capitalize on nostalgia should have gone with the nostalgic look.
gaming,"I don’t know, be creative for once in your life?"
gaming,Halo on Easy isn't bad but gives a lot of room to grow.
gaming,But it's a movie about a video game.
gaming,[be careful what you wish for](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/yjp7n)
gaming,Except earlier someone linked a live action insurance commercial earlier from a few years ago where sonic looked like sonic and it wasnt that jarring.
gaming,The male lead is definitely named Tails somehow.
gaming,"Production wise there's definitely money behind it, but a high budget does not a decent movie make.

Also Jim Carrey will likely be a heavy influence on the numbers for this movie..

Honestly all they had to do was adjust the look to be closer to the character we already know :/"
gaming,"Nevermind I fixed the issue: All I had to do was click (Windows key+G) and click the ""Allow microphone while not recording"""
gaming,How did you find this comment?
gaming,"I get so mad about that too. It’s even worse when it just one of the ones that skip frame to it, like keep your secrets."
gaming,Super Mario was somewhat ground breaking back then in regards to special effects.
gaming,"Oh I remember avatar, that's the show that (and I quote the director) ""is a cartoon for kids"" right?"
gaming,I honestly didn’t think it looked that bad. But I may be clinically insane idk.
gaming,Halo would be pretty good actually. That’s pretty much how I learned
gaming,Is it wrong for me to find Sonic's design in this film so bad it's funny?
gaming,Jim Carrey will pull a grinch again.
gaming,Snooping as usual I see
gaming,AKA the 30 under 30.
gaming,The only one I have seen was hatred and that was a..... it was something
gaming,Because 60 FPS is why.
gaming,Sonic Generations was good. Come on guys
gaming,Punctuation is a sentence killer.
gaming,"If you want a live-action Sonic, you can't have that weird one-eyeball-two-pupils thing."
gaming,"To be fair, none of the Sonic games have really added more than 3 or 4 characters at a time. Even Sonic Heroes, notorious for having 14 characters, 12 playable, only actually introduced 1 character, Omega, who was just a replacement for Gamma who died in Adventure 1. I guess SA1 did introduce 5 characters in Big, Froggy, Tikal, Chaos, and Gamma, but Tikal, Chaos, and Gamma don't return that much, and who really cares about Big and Froggy?"
gaming,Which he isn't going to do. It's go to be another generic Jim Carrey character.
gaming,"Huh huh huh, I think it’s cool. You buttmunch. Huh huh huh"
gaming,Already played them. Nothing against the games.
gaming,"&gt;He calls himself Eggman in the later games though

His ships have ""Eggman"" written on them in the Sonic the Hedgehog 2."
gaming,It’s for copyright purposes
gaming,"[OMGOD read his bio](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0682300/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm)


Wait, **what**:

&gt;Pierce and appeared with Patty Duke and Melissa Gilbert in the TV film Cries from the Heart/Touch of Truth as an *autistic* child named Michael.

Why is Sonic so inextricably linked to autism? What's actually going on here?!"
gaming,Oooh I forgot all about that. I need to give them a shot
gaming,His reaction is appropriate.
gaming,THAT'S why he looked so familiar...
gaming,yo wtf why does this bastard have human teeth
gaming,wtf is up with the contrast on this image. You cant even see the bottom of Tails' face.
gaming,"It's not permanent, it's an illusory spell. I havent watched GoT though."
gaming,"They play gangstas paradise in the trailer. Jim Carrey is playing an over the top weirdo, akin to all of his 90s roles. This is aimed at nostalgia money, as much as it is kids."
gaming,I'm so sorry brother
gaming,Get New Vegas instead
gaming,WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
gaming,When it's not a live action cgi abomination.
gaming,I don't get where they're going with this design. It's like they tried making him more realistic. Except he's a giant anthropomorphic blue hedgehog.
gaming,cough cough X button
gaming,"Okay, I am gonna say that this isn't what happened. Sega sold movie rights to Sony in 2013, and the Sonic movie sat in limbo while Sony tried to find traction, but eventually that whole deal didn't work out but the character and likeness was already licensed for one movie so they just sold it to Paramount. Sega has actually publicly stated that they did not approve of the Sonic movie's design, but because of some legal jargon, Sega lost any and all creative control over it and it is literally in its entirety, Paramount's fault. Sega is strongly opposed to the designs, and I'm sure they will say as much after this trailer, but they can't pull the plug, make edits, or anything. Paramount can literally and legally ignore Sega and fuck the hedgehog how they want, as we just saw."
gaming,Honestly I would just put them into something like cod it will be difficult at first but eventually they will get it down.
gaming,"Yeah and it’s simpler than modern shooters. Also lots of fun and it never gets old. 

Portal is a great suggestion too that someone else mentioned. The Orange Box is a really great deal. Half Life 2’s story is amazing. Episode 1 and 2 are also great.

The AI in HL2 isn’t that good so it’s good practice for sure and very satisfying when firing the sub machine gun. That sound never gets old."
gaming,Sega really fucked up when they introduced 3D trying to keep up with mario64 and it just plummeted rock-bottom tbh.
gaming,"Damn, too obvious I guess. GG"
gaming,"Oh rlly? dam

f"
gaming,Probably for fresh merchandising.
gaming,Never a good sign when theres multiple artist renditions done in a single day that look better then the big budget blockbuster movie.
gaming, was searching for this one
gaming,"I was not a fan of it, played it for the first couple days after it came out but haven’t touched it since"
gaming,Knowing this fact made this post 10x funnier
gaming,Why do people judge it when they haven't even seen it yet?
gaming,I should eat your ass for saying Sonic Heroes was meh
gaming,Ahhhhh yes club Nintendo. The new rewards system will never be the same
gaming,I agree. The music is great. The stages are a pain in the butt. I’d probably like them if they fixed that stupid radar thing. Sonic Adventure 2’s was a nightmare.
gaming,"I remember when I was a kid, mid to late 90’s my local giant eagle had a spot to let your kids stay at while my mom shopped. Had a SNES inside and I think maybe a N64? Either way it was the best time ever going to the store with mom. Man those were the days.

Edit: was called the eagles nest"
gaming,Well now you know they do!
gaming,"Jumanji the Sonic Hog

Or

Sonic the Jumanjhog"
gaming,"ah sorry its the way i write sentances  the internet kind of

conditioned me"
gaming,Now he just looks like Beast from X-men.
gaming,I reported the trailer for abuse
gaming,Is this dunkeys car?
gaming,Looks like Cat in the Hat Mike Meyers version
gaming,If only they had had some existing 3D models to work from...
gaming,u/photon45 smh I know you did this first man
gaming,Malcolm and the middle where the dad takes up the speed walking sport.
gaming,In a champagne supernova in the sky
gaming,The new Sonic looks like they created him based off of a guys description who only saw him once back in the 90s and was high on speed when he saw him but he really didn't remember how he looked so he guessed
gaming,Consider my mind blown.
gaming,"Jesus... you got so mad over a guy explicitly saying that he was stating his opinion... yikes.

The thing is, Dota isn’t better than league, but league isn’t better than Dota either. It’s literally a preference. Resorting to ad hominem when there is no objective right is just pathetic.

But, just to humor you, you missed the entire point of his argument. Just because a game has simpler rules doesn’t mean that it is easy. If it was, then there wouldn’t be so many people playing it-all of them divided into clear ranks. Why wouldn’t everyone be challenger/pro? Because it takes time to master. 

Let me give you another example just to make it abundantly clear for you. Riding a bike. Really easy. You probably know how to. Takes maybe a few days? To learn. Does that mean that the sport of cycling is easy? Hell no.

The impressive part about league is that the basic rules are very plainly painted out to user from the get-go, yet it maintains a very high skill ceiling due to the multitude of skills you must master to get to the highest levels. 

Just screaming “I do this and people who do that is stupid” is a very very foolish way to go about doing things."
gaming,It's bluewho from whovile
gaming,This shouldn't have needed to be said...
gaming,Lol I’m weird and I like to play crossover games. Ryu and Shovel Knight happens to be in most of them.
gaming,"Do I? Because based on the trailer, which I admit didn't show *much*, he's going for ""Dr. Evil minus the funny"".

Which is sad because I love his movies so much. Let's hope the crazy comes out quick."
gaming,Have you played the Bioshock games? Your actions don’t effect the game dramatically but they do alter things a little. Heavy rain also comes to mind although it’s not post apocalyptic.
gaming,"Great. This is going to be a meme, I just can't wait..."
gaming,Far Cry 1 is a little bit hard imo. You really need to move around a lot otherwise you’re a sitting duck. Never played 2 or 3 even though I have them on my Xbox One X. I also bought Far Cry 5 during the last sale for $15 but have to finish RDR2 and AC:Odyssey first!
gaming,Sonic is getting ROASTED- I’m all here for it
gaming,"It began to rain. It's still raining. 


It's still raining.


The sun is shining. Shits still shining."
gaming,"Um I do remember being so excited about that Mario bros. movie. That was awful, but that Mario bros. TV show was pretty great. So was Sonic. Soooooo video game should never be movies, but TV shows a solid."
gaming,"Would the plural be Geneses? Genesii? Genesissesses?

I think your way is best..."
gaming,"Ehh. Not really. The controls/camera are mediocre at best, the story is pretty damn basic, and the voice acting is god awful. I recently replayed it and still enjoyed it thoroughly because of nostalgia reasons but it really isn't a good game."
gaming,"Bioshock Infinite. It has an amazing and gripping story that might press her to finish till the end. I only say this because my wife hated games and she fell inlove with gaming after Bioshock Infinite. She never thought game could carry such a gripping narrative.

Not an FPS but my wife really liked Mass Effect 3 as she is a Star Trek fan. And loved the characters

Mirrors Edge (the original) is also a interesting take on first person controls that might grip her aswell."
gaming,"Shut up nerds, it looks fun"
gaming,Does this actually work?
gaming,You guys should give Hungry Shark Evolution a try.
gaming,"Mothers-in-law, crèmes brulée, passers-by..."
gaming,Ah fuck.  I can't believe they've done this.
gaming,"Honestly, play 2, 3, and Blood Dragon and you're pretty much solid. I haven't played Primal, seems like something that I'd enjoy, but definitely like something you wouldn't need to play."
gaming,I feel like they modeled him after Chucky.
gaming,"Try to get some sleep after playing it for hours and hours the first time you pick it up. 


It's that good."
gaming,"Except the sad part is that Lucas really did try, at least for Ep. 1. My theory is he put his heart and soul into that movie and was crushed when people legitimately hated it. He then focused only on the technological aspects of filmmaing in episodes 2 &amp; 3, and phoned in the story, script, and directing."
gaming,"Whoa, I stopped reading the comics around the SA1 crossover happened. Is that from the Archie canon or the more recent comic canon?"
gaming,I remembered learning that from a YouTube game facts type episode from someone I can't remember lol I had took up the dates though because i forgot those
gaming,What is up with this sonic thing
gaming,the game is just damn good
gaming,It looks like the CG team only had pictures on sonic Popsicle.
gaming,"The director said that Sonic looked too much like he was nude and that it wouldn't work on screen without causing a lot of people to be triggered over it. 

It also doesn't work the way it's been changed.

That means it's just something nobody should make a movie of."
gaming,Yeah I just decapitated him.......
gaming,I can't believe how irrationally bothered I am by this Sonic.
gaming,Found a Rand Paul voter in the wild
gaming,I haven't been this giddy about a trailer for a movie so guaranteed to be terrible since The Core.
gaming,"Sega isn't at fault. Sony purchased the rights to make a movie before, but that never worked out and through some legal bullshit, Paramount obtained the license in a way that Sega is not able to have any creative input. Sega has actually come out against the Sonic redesign in this movie when the initial images were released. But again, through legal assfuckery, Paramount can ignore Sega and do what they fucking want to with the Sonic movie."
gaming,Plenty of online porn ones sure
gaming,I might have 2 and 3 from PS+ as well... 2 for sure
gaming,"Imagine all the Big Hands Big Shoes jokes we are gonna be missing out on, if we see the movie."
gaming,Movie’s going to bomb so hard Japan will surrender.
gaming,Sonic's body makes me feel really uncomfortable.
gaming,Malcolm in the Middle. Competitive speed-walking
gaming,"Lol is declining now anyways, especially outside china"
gaming,Thanks I hate it
gaming,Farcry 4 was really drab. Lack of story following 3.
gaming,Yeah bro I think it's called the brain
gaming,But if they used that design they couldnt have him wear Nike® shoes.
gaming,Yes we're all triggered by your weirdness
gaming,It's very rare. It's from Connecticut.
gaming,"&gt;  just hope that the jim carrey scenes make it worth it 

I'll just wait for the ""all the Jim Carrey as Eggman"" video on youtube"
gaming,"OH MY GOD, IT HAS TEETH!"
gaming,"Hot take: I'm actually really looking forward to this movie, since watching the trailer. I don't think it'll do well, but I think that it's just being whatever it's going to be. We all just have to figure out how to deal with that. And I respect it."
gaming,"For a new character, he doesn't look terrible, but the thing is we already have an idea of what sonic should look like, and it ain't this. His proportions are way off (human proportions don't work for most cartoon characters) and his eyes are really ruining his look. He looks way too childish and ""realistic""... Compare this with the amazing job they've done so far with Pikachu, it's night and day."
gaming,"*Flashbacks to the Tempered Deviljho that appeared in my 2 Tempered-Bazelguese hunt*

gaming,"Jfc just throw him in already, why do you have to dig his grave deeper than the Mariana Trench?"
gaming,Literally about to start it lol and that’s good
gaming,Sonic looks good. The aura is a bit messy.
gaming,That is so cool👍
gaming,Jim Carrey is in this movie....
gaming,It's gonna be trash fire.
gaming,Bro looks like your grandma's rug
gaming,Wait. Who made that image on the right? That’s what he should look like without a doubt!!!
gaming,"Sega has been trying to kill sonic for years.

  


It's the only reason they would make Sonic 06"
gaming,"Pikachu movie looks awesome. Not even a pokemon fan, didn't play any of the games or watch the TV show...

Played sonic back on master system II and various versions since. This movie, wtf?"
gaming,Never before have I needed something so much and not known until I received it.
gaming,"""IGN"" say no more."
gaming,"sonic has been around for like 20 years, why do you feel like you can alter it at this point?"
gaming,I literally don't understand how anyone can think this looks good. It's fucking hideous.
gaming,Sonic Adventure 2 was the shit
gaming,DiegexTheChilean On Ps4 Brotha'
gaming,"Archie. 

Issues 121-125, I think, although I might be a little off."
gaming,And packed with dried bbq 😧
gaming,"Oh don’t get me wrong, I still loved playing that one, it was just odd for a sonic game, but still fun."
gaming,I still enjoy that mario movie
gaming,"Genuine question, why are people upset about this movie? The CGI looks descent. Or do people just want to be mad about everything?"
gaming,Too many chilli dogs?
gaming,"Which one had the chick scream and it exploded mountains?

Who cares, I loved them both."
gaming,Furry in charge of design lost their way
gaming,Now I know this guy is a furry.
gaming,Don’t threaten me with a good time.
gaming,"As many times as you motherfuckers post this exact unoriginal comment, I'm surprised you don't know the answer already."
gaming,You know it says a lot about this movie that it’s already not following its own rules in just the trailer
gaming,90’s had plenty of broken games and glitches but the games were more basic and even if there was a bug you weren’t gonna be able to hook your Genesis up to dial up internet to download a patch.
gaming,"Played Pokemon Stadium 2 on one of those. Washed my hands after, of course."
gaming,"Let's be real now, if it's anything close to that bad it'd just be all the more memorable for it."
gaming,Don't know what that guy is talking about. The game is generally better than BF1 I would say.
gaming,Is he supposed to be an alien.
gaming,"John Leguizamo is my reason.

Sexy *stupid* Luigi."
gaming,I find putting my gimp mask makes my poor sadness go away
gaming,"Sega had no control with this. They sold the rights to Sony in 2013, the production sat in Limbo, and through some legal bullshit, Sega lost creative control and Sony sold the license to Paramount. So Paramount legally ignored Sega on any and all input and just assfucked the blue hedgehog. Sega itself even said they were displeased with what they saw before the trailer dropped. I can't wait to see Sega's response to the actual trailer."
gaming,GG I really cant wait to die!!
gaming,I can’t even count the amount of times someone trolled and made us lose the game and I get pissed off and then off my computer only to turn it back on 10 minutes later and pour another 3 hours into the game

gaming,"Actually? Best part of the trailer imo, at least in terms of looks. If only Carrey wasn't a terrible casting decision. Upon reflection, Robotnik is a surprisingly serious villain."

gaming,"While discussing the Sonic Trailer with a friend, he brought up Super Mario Bros and the reason I think they don't compare is what they were aiming for.  Sure, goomba doesn't look like a goomba and bowser doesn't look like bowser, but they weren't aiming to show you a mushroom and a giant fire breathing turtle.  Sonic is aiming to give you Sonic, but falls into the uncanny valley which is why it looks so weird to everyone: because it really is failing on 2 counts, not just for not looking like Sonic.

Also, I'm of the opinion that movies that ended up so bad they're good don't end up that way because of the visuals.  'So bad it's good' is achieved IMO by the genuine attempt to make it good outshining the ridiculousness of the movie.  Something about how much passion the actors are putting in and the fun they seem to be having shines through the absolute stupid of the film (which means sonic could still achieve it, though I'm not holding my breath), but that's my 2 cents."
gaming,I’m sorry but super Mario bros the movie was the shiznizzy. Nothing like the dumpster fire that is the sonic movie.

it was a comparison of sonic screaming and live action grinch screaming,with edits for both in eachother's colours"
gaming,"Upvote this higher. This was what I would have loved. This would have been fine. 

NOW UPDATE THE WRITING AND GIVE ME SOME GOD DAMN PLOT AND BACKSTORY... Ty"
gaming,If I have to suffer this then so do the rest of you
gaming,"What a wholesome way to say ""fuck u"" to someone."
gaming,"Only if you can choose to play as different characters. 

Pick Littlefinger and try to manipulate others to the top and try to fuck Sansa. 

Pick Wheelchair Bran and stare at people to manipulate their souls and read their futures.

Pick Jamie and fuck your Sister Queen. Tap ‘A’ to thrust."
gaming,"Because that actually looks palatable.      Of course, we *can't* have that!"
gaming,"Oh, now I get you, I must have been a page or 2 behind on this one.

But yes, I completely agree."
gaming,"Depends on what you want to play, if your skipping out on GBC games get a ds, if your playing all of them get a GBA SP. Both have a backlight and don't require AAs every once in a while."
gaming,YOU LEAVE MARIO MARIO ALONE
gaming,"It feels like whenever they make movie adaptations from video games. They never reach out to people who actually worked on these games to make it as accurate as possible. The Assassins Creed had nothing to do with the games and the movie producer specified that, it was still kinda bad but the Sonic one was bad ever since they released the poster and showed Sonic. I am a bog fan of the games and seeing this happen to a game I enjoy is kinda sad."
gaming,"Agreed, the entire thing looks awful, and then Jim Carrey just shows up and just plays every character he's ever played and I'm sold. And by sold I mean probably going to watch his bits on youtube, which is more than I expected out of this movie."
gaming,Movie studios should work on the characters first and release a preview and see the reaction. Then change it to what the fans want.
gaming,Why are you proving my point even more? Also my comment doesn’t even indicate me being mad.
gaming,They didn't have to make the movie live action. I don't see why they couldn't have just avoided the problem completely if they just embraced Sonic as the cartoon mascot he is. It's not like CG movies are doing poorly or something.
gaming,"&gt; This upcoming Lion King remake is going to be the biggest insult yet.

Upcoming Your Name remake: “hold my beer”"
gaming,"I love that terrible mess of a movie, and I can learn to love this one too!"
gaming,"Did you want me to not say all that again?

Yes

--&gt; No"
gaming,"&gt;What the fuck is this? 

A decent meme template I guess."
gaming,Isnt there an age restrcition on game?
gaming,"It's a joke, grow up"
gaming,"If not soda, do you call it pop or by a different name?"
gaming,"Yep, u are defenitive mad bro xdxd."
gaming,It's the internet. Who cares
gaming,"Source - [Awkward Zombie](http://www.awkwardzombie.com/index.php?page=0&amp;comic=072516)

Game - Fire Emblem Fates"
gaming,Wow some janky animations.
gaming,I love and hate this.
gaming,How old are you?
gaming,He wasn't naked through he was in his boxers
gaming,The fact that you even sometimes call it coke makes me not care where you live.
gaming,"Jim Carey is a great choice (as a number of others would have been too) but they did it all wrong. 

Sonic looks way too humanized and it’s so off putting, it’s almost disturbing. 

The entire premise looks so forced and cliche. 

I’m very disappointed, and usually they show you the best clips in the trailer. 

0/10. No hope."
gaming,was it removed? i can still see it but i don't reddit a lot
gaming,Sonic 1 was the best. I knew the cheat code to get into dev mode. Could create crap all over the place. Was fun as hell.
gaming,I'm just fucking around. Clearly it's working
gaming,No one. This movie has to have been made solely as a way to move money around. It's the only plausible scenario.
gaming,"I love the game. Hate (most of) the community. If you’re trying to learn a new champion, you’re not playing the game right apparently :/"
gaming,"Your submission has been removed because we do not allow redd.it link posts except for static images. Why? Our spam controls get screwed up by the v.redd.it domain.  Please use Youtube to host videos or imgur/gfycat for gifs, thanks!


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gaming) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
gaming,Very well worth a play is generations for the right price anyway.
gaming,"I actually did completely hate the trailer. Loved Jim Carey. The biggest problem is the same as the games- they can figure out what kinda universe Sonic exists in. Had they just gone all the way into the silliness like Speed Racer, this likely would be pretty fun"
gaming,Don't put a space in between
gaming,"Wow, I feel so dumb right now..."
gaming,17 years old and you? 7 years old xd
gaming,i think you mean Heroic
gaming,Just looks like more of the same... TAKE MY MONEY!!!
gaming,for me it says [removed]
gaming,Whenever he does his stretching he looks like an Oompa Loompa from the Johnny Depp Willy Wonka
gaming,"Well, no promises but you probably *did* just help your chances."
gaming,gatekeeper to what? Difficulty? Quit projecting.
gaming,Oh no please tell me you've played pre MHW
gaming,No one hates SEGA screwing up Sonic more than the fans.
gaming,Where do you live where buying a home release is cheaper than going to a theather?
gaming,Usually happens with these type of movies after VHS release.
gaming,"I agree I’m sick of the ads, I prefer 1st or 3rd person view not a locked birds view"
gaming,"Skyrim, she go first person or third and it is simply awesome."
gaming,"Sonic Generations was a great game... So was Sonic 4.... I feel like I played another one, oh yeah sonic colors was acceptable back in the day"
gaming,Sonic has done something amazing though. It has made Will Smith's Genie look not so bad.
gaming,Donkey Kong tv show was the pinnacle of humanities achievements.
gaming,"Most of the midwest says pop. I was with you until that was your example. By that reasoning the midwest is all goblin people. You want weird, look at the trend around Milwaukee to call drinking fountains/water fountains a bubbler... Now that's weird."
gaming,But wait you've almost convinced us!
gaming,In true Sonic fashion: it's already shipped.. last week :|
gaming,"Worked better than my stepped on, tripped over, cord wrapped in a weird x pattern around the controller, controller...Must have been the McGrease."
gaming,It has the character models of hoenn and the map of Kanto I think... either it’s a specific Pokémon center or it’s a rom hack?
gaming,How is warframe not on this list
gaming,Do you put “xd” in literally 99% of your comments?
gaming,Why are the legs toothpicks? This rat isn't even proportional.
gaming,"I feel like you just pop instantly, always."
gaming,I dunno. I'm kind of looking forward to seeing Jim Carrey as Dr. Eggman.
gaming,"Yah wrong buddy. You may have the internet to play on, but we had couch multiplayer. 4 Xboxs linked to play 16 player local Halo matches. Even better was stealing my uncle's 56k settings to dial up to play PSO online for Dreamcast. Nowadays it's shallow games riddled with mtx traps."
gaming,"it's not that bad. I bet the reason why they did this was because the internet was going to find some way to complain and say that ""🧐 oh, oh, t's not realistic enough, make it realistic""  so they made it realistic and look this is how it looks, this is what it looks like. instead of making it exactly like the cartoon/animated sonic we all know, which the inter will still find a way to complain. but they're trying (director's) to be proactive , they even got Jim carrey on this thing, and no. People are complaining that this movie is dragging Jim down. It's not he's elevating the movie ^.
But the internet always wins I guess."
gaming,Y'all ever just try to have fun with fun stuff or are y'all always mad about inane shit?
gaming,"Me: ""wait, monkeys aren't blue""

Nintendo: ""hold my pansear"""
gaming,Oh sorry lady lol
gaming,Don't forget the fucking human teeth
gaming,"It works, I mean you can settle for a charmander.  I'd have to figure out a way to make Squirtle work.  Squirtle is the best starter ever!  Fight me!"
gaming,"You’d think so, but I did one commission and it just turned my fun time into work time. I strongly believe in separating work and pleasure. Not that you can’t enjoy your job, but y’know... boundaries and such."
gaming,"&gt;had literal fucking Looney Toons

I mean, [so did Who Framed Roger Rabbit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKjUtTC3e0Y&amp;app=desktop)"
gaming,"It's permanent. But it's a top notch magic and not something sorcerers would do on daily basis. And women are not the only ones who use such magic. Men use it to keep them look like middle aged men because they look more representative, when women tend to keep their appearance close to young age to look more sexy."
gaming,"You were probably thinking of Realm of Forgotten Legends, or its expansion, Realm of the Fantastic Legendary Magical Arcane Overlords."
gaming,Oh god... He's Poochie...
gaming,And he’s cooking his bacon
gaming,"A whole bunch of people, who get paid tons of money, got together and agreed this was a good idea?"
gaming,this should be on cursed images
gaming,"I think I’m the only one that wants to watch this, even though he looks like a bootleg version of the actual sonic."
gaming,What a world we live in!
gaming,I’m so bummed for Ben Schwartz
gaming,"Why are his arms blue? Would it look to weird for them to be the same color as his tummy like they normally are?  

Also, needs more gloves."
gaming,It's the only way to achieve Godyr status
gaming,none of them have analog sticks
gaming,"For all the hate being leveled at this movie, Jim Carrey appears to be having a really good time."
gaming,"Flashbacks? Akali is very new

Edit: I'm an idiot, I'm thinking of the rework. Thanks."
gaming,"Maybe so, but it's undeniable couch multiplayer is far better than internet play."
gaming,"Unfortunately The Lost is so difficult to pull off a Delirium or Greedier run that pretty much any advice tends to be ""yeah just find brim"" advice lol

The newer content is so much harder to pull off compared to what it used to be (Mega Satan is super easy in comparison to Hush and Delirium, for example)"
gaming,"Sonic '06 and everything after has been an absolute trainwreck. Sonic's been down 'n' out for years with no signs of recovery. So long as they stick with the same, tired formula, it won't get better. Sonic Forces seemed to be the admittance that it's just a niche furry fanbase now and the complete surrender to fate. The movie won't bring Sonic back, it's only going to drive the nails further into the coffin.

Only thing bringing him back is to finally give Sonic an appropriate, huge, open-world environment for players to really run around in and experience Sonic's speed. Basically, make Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, but, instead of Hulk's strength, Sonic's speed is the focal point of power along which you craft the experience."
gaming,We’ve strayed too far from god.
gaming,People assume they have no life. Maybe they just practice efficiently. I'm unable to spend long hours at a time playing games. I'm still able to beat 95% of players I encounter though
gaming,If you are trying to use the touch pad and keys at the same time all you have to do is change the settings to allow you to do so.
gaming,Lmfao yes. Yes you are.
gaming,Bombing hills in San Francisco as the opening never gets old tho. I still like the story.
gaming,"Yeah thats right, i need to change :("
gaming,"I think a lot of Sonic fans were exited about the *concept* of a sonic movie, including me. The problem was it was *executed* so horribly wrong. The tried to make the characters look more ""realistic"" but only succeeded in making them really unpleasant to look at."
gaming,"Or you could build an automated watermelon farm like my roommate did. It would harvest all the melons with a push of a button and they could all be picked up in one location, with a chest conveniently nearby. He always had an endless supply of melons that fucker, I think he even made a melon house."
gaming,"The Speed of Sound will forever run my heart aflame. 

But yes you nailed it pretty spot on"
gaming,"""I'll take a coke"" ""pepsi okay?"" ""yep"" or vice versa. They're interchangeable. I don't call Sprite or Dr. Pepper a coke."
gaming,Robotnik boss theme from Sonic 2 is a clear winner for fighting off missiles. Oil Ocean theme always did it for me too.
gaming,It was one of my favorite episodes!
gaming,Yeah my friend group does this pretty frequently. Olivia Wilde Tracker instead of Ulvenwald Tracker. I think it's natural as you end up saying the card names over and over
gaming,"They should ask for a ""sucrose syrup sweetened (flavor) soda"" like any civilized being, right?"
gaming,*shoots him and quarters fly everywhere*
gaming,Unpopular opinion: League of Legends is really fun and good game.
gaming,10/10 would wife again.
gaming,Yes thank you! People are overhyping how bad it’ll be but not giving it a chance. People will complain about anything
gaming,"Batman fan, checking in. Nolan's trilogy should never have happened."
gaming,"No one thought it was going to be the Godfather. That was/is not the expectation. Criticizing something isn't virtue signaling. This is pretty obviously crap - cheesy dialogue, terrible design, weird and inappropriate music choice for the trailer."
gaming,They grow up too fast
gaming,I will bet money that is dunkey’s car
gaming,"Is that really considered gameplay tho lol. 
But the design does look much more refined if that’s a good example of the rest."
gaming,"Yes, it skips text just as fast and doesn’t automatically open it again."
gaming,edited my post with a link
gaming,"Oh shit, thats fuck"
gaming,This looks better than the actual sonic movie
gaming,"If 9 years ago is very new, ok"
gaming,"Try ""pahp"". Smaller adjustment."
gaming,"Agreed, Super Mario Bros. Was my damn childhood"
gaming,"Thing is, it doesn’t matter if the movie is awful. Tons on people are still gonna go see it because it’s Sonic and the fact it looks horrible is gonna make even more people go see it ironically."
gaming,"The head's still kind of off but the torso and legs look way better. Still think he should've had gloves, too."
gaming,So people guessing and saying something looks like crap means they must be clairvoyant now? People can't have opinions based on a shitty trailer?
gaming,Camera was shitty for sure. But the sonic and shadow levels control very well with great flow and level design. And the soundtrack was killer. The story and voice acting are nothing great but when I replay I’m mostly going for higher ranks replaying levels. Probably never playing story again. But the game definitely holds up
gaming,"if i were stuck in a room with cigarettes, like, a dickload of fentanyl, and league of legends, i smoke every cigarette and then overdose on the fentanyl to avoid playing league"
gaming,God fuck the one on the left just looks like a mutilated version of the one on the right now.
gaming,To make sure he never goes fast again.
gaming,Ya I liked it.
gaming,And Kylie Minogue’s... pants
gaming,League always brings out the best comments on reddit.  Just like how the game brings out the best in people.  And exactly like how Riot Games brings out the best work environment for women.
gaming,30 dollars I think.
gaming,I cant believe he achieved super saiyan blue
gaming,That's basically what they did in the newer movie. Only with a touch more skill points invested in BUFF.
gaming,"No, I'm not. In the year 2019, where would 'tons of kids' know Sonic the Hedgehog from. Smash, right? Except there's really absolutely no indication of who any of the characters are in that game unless you know them originally."
gaming,I know that was one of the better parts about him.
gaming,Too boring to hold right the whole time?
gaming,"Lol idk how many times I've bought that game. My first Sonic game, Gamecube version."
gaming,I felt so uncomfortable zooming on those dead eyes
gaming,"Accidentally left green hill zone playing on a loop while high on mushrooms. 

Can confirm it is a special kind of hell"
gaming,I am the walrus!
gaming,My favourites will always be Open your Heart and Live and Learn. As I’m typing this I realise I have more favourites and cannot pick just those two.
gaming,"Disclaimer: posting for non-redditor friend who made the image.

She says: Original character do not steal."
gaming,no Kirby's just wearing a Sonic fursuit
gaming,We found the bronze 3.
gaming,"Yeah, but reshoots can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Solo, for example, basically doubled in cost form 150mm to 300mm. So, even though the budget’s probably lower (let’s say 110mm, the same as that Smurf’s movie), it could go as high as 220mm with reshoots, which’d mean it’d need to gross &gt;450mm dollars to break even. And IDK if that can happen.

If I were Paramount, I’d quietly drop the turd with little advertising and hope and pray there other properties, like Terminator, Nickelodeon movies, and Hasbro movies pan out, cause a studio things aren’t looking good. Their Transformers movies have been making less money as time goes on, Star Trek’s on hiatus for an unknown amount of time, and Mission Impossible might be gone when Tom Cruise retires, and they don’t have any other big franchises."
gaming,"Just so you know, titles never respect line breaks. So hitting enter would never work. OP should've just put a period there.

Heck, even on Reddit comments, hitting ""Enter"" doesn't create a line break. You have to add 2 spaces at the end of a line, and *then* hit ""Enter."" Or for a paragraph break, you have to hit ""Enter"" twice.

Neither of those work for titles either, though. No line breaks allowed."
gaming,This one has Jim Carrey. I'm seeing this.
gaming,Has the movie leaked early or something? I'm confused.
gaming,I never even noticed his arms weren't peach. Fuck me it's so bad...
gaming,"Not what I said, I said they probably demanded what the shoes would look like. Then the designers had to work with a look of the shoe and proportioned him to match his feet."
gaming,"“Awesome, thanks. HELL YEAH! READY, AIM, AND FI-“"
gaming,"Because Sega never gives their staff enough time, money, or personnel to actually create a good game. Sometimes they manage to make a good one by accident, but that's always the exception rather than the rule."
gaming,"it's everyone's car who is either an ex-LoL player or someone who knows of LoL and hasn't played

my fucking god i hear more positive feedback on people's opioid addictions than i do LoL. even if LoL's only 1/10th as bad as what I've heard. i don't understand how a game with such a wretched reputation manages to attract new players."
gaming,I mean does the movie really look that bad? I mean geez. People are killing the movie over a 2:30 min trailer. I didn’t think it looked that. Yes he looks weird but get over it?
gaming,There's actually going to be a live stream of borderlands 3 gameplay in 15 hours (3am local time for me - alarm will be set).  😜
gaming,Just one of the many reasons I want to fucking kill myself theses days
gaming,Both played by the same actor? Looks like it.
gaming,"If you said I could watch only one movie all year and I had to choose between seeing detective pikachu and sonic after seeing the trailer for each...

It would be detective pikachu. 11/10 times. Not even a choice, this looks *that* bad."
gaming,"They made Sonic Mania, which is amazing. They can make good Sonic games, it patently clear that they just don't try most of the time. Just look at how bland and mediocre Forces is, they had a good foundation with Generations and then proceeded to squander it."
gaming,Except its primarily meant to appeal to nostalgia from sonic fans who are in the 20+ demographic. Many kids these days probably dont even know who sonic is.
gaming,Teen wolf gets the blueberry treatment from Willy wonka
gaming,Even by photoshopping the top one it doesn’t look the same.
gaming,"Unfortunately, it is objectively poor game design if someone needs to go find in-depth guides to minute tactics just to get through a difficulty of the game."
gaming,"I dunno man, I can't be the only one who's regularly watching the Live Action Rocky and Bullwinkle movie.

Can I?"
gaming,It was brand new
gaming,"I'm worried Carey won't actually bring the scary evil quality and will just be cartoon-goofy the whole time, because this trailer really doesn't demonstrate anything else."
gaming,"I’m sorry, but sonic looks awful. I just can’t handle this.... (scream into a void) lol"
gaming,Most of Canada calls soda 'pop' as well so maybe we are an extension of Ohio
gaming,A who from whoville duhh
gaming,"It’s definitely not as good as Zelda, but it’s a solid game. I’m really enjoying the enemies, atmosphere, and alchemy aspect. The alchemy is very easy to pick up. I would highly suggest it for just $10."
gaming,No you wouldn’t stop lying to yourself. That other one is bullshit.. so boring. I want to see Mickey Mouse like this too.
gaming,Touché.  I admit defeat.
gaming,"I think so. I know it has DOOM on it. I'm not entirely sure if that version includes DOOM II tho. That may be Final Doom. But yes, that does include the first game."
gaming,"Yeah dota 2 players don't really go around saying league sucks. (But if it comes up in passing, they have lots of strong opinions to that effect.)"
gaming,"To be fair, the reviewer said in a podcast that the game was just too long for its own good and wasn't really a bad game. I decided it was worth it to me as it sounds similar to other games I like even if a bit less polished."
gaming,The shampoo is tear-less if it removes your eyes!
gaming,This statement feels true
gaming,The work culture equivalent of that one GED Math class back in highschool.
gaming,"But, I mean, kids ate up Sonic when he looked like... Sonic. Just ask the 90s.

So it's not like updating it to this abomination is ""for the kids."""
gaming,I get it. I want to separate myself from work completely.
gaming,"Sonic 2 on the Genesis is my favorite.
But not as much as Ocarina of Time."
gaming,Only gonna watch this movie because of Jim Carrey
gaming,"G O O B L E   G O B B L E

[G O O B L E   G O B B L E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C4uTEEOJlM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=16)"
gaming,Idk if it counts as rpg but i fell in love with hollow knight
gaming,"Yeah, I’m definitely getting a switch for mario maker 2."
gaming,"Kids still know what Sonic looks like, I don't think they'll be fooled"
gaming,lol what movie is this scene from?
gaming,People think the movie is ruined cause they don't like how he looks? Pokemon isn't gonna be good just cause Pokemon look good.
gaming,I'm still furiously angry at that kid for not chopping a single giant spider with that axe
gaming,Me too. I doubt I’ll be seeing it in theaters though.
gaming,I’d be Robotnik by the end of the week.
gaming,"RT was doing it up to a few months ago but not anymore thanks to Captain Marvel, so it is now more common in gaming. In boardgames (BGG), hundreds of people give 10s (and some 1s) to games just announced just because they like or dislike the author. The result is that most heavy games, which have the more hardcore followers, end up with inflated scores."
gaming,"The problem is that they try to re-invent the wheel literally every time they release a new game.

They occasionally hit on some good stuff (Colors &amp; Generations for example) and then throw EVERYTHING out and start over.

They need to learn to iterate more."
gaming,Holy shit Sonic looks like one of the Whoville people from that live action Grinch movie.
gaming,"Did everyone see the trailer and hate it? Weird, cause it looked good to me."
gaming,"Like I feel like the general idea of the movie could actually be not terrible, and maybe even like....good? Except for the horrorshow that they made Sonic into, and just how badddd Robotnik's dialogue is, and probably a bunch of plotholes that an hour of extra script editing could have fixed."
gaming,"It is permanently indeed. Reconstruction magic doesn't fade off with time. Of course, you can use this magic again to morph mage into some ugly man, but it's not like you disenchant previous spell.

Reconstruction magic is also used as medicine. Triss, for example was burned like Darth Vader on Sodden hill, but brought to normal state (almost normal in books, she still has scars on chest, as she mention that she couldn't wear dresses with low neckline anymore)."
gaming,He wasn't in the OG sonic.   Gonna have to wait
gaming,Yeah even with the recoloring it doesn’t look the same. Folks want to be mad.
gaming,She seems....large (not fat) for a &lt;4y/o....
gaming,"Clearly, the guy wielding the gun is using hax to cheat."
gaming,I only played Shadow The Hedgehog game for like 10 mins and nothing else before and barely know the history. So after watching the trailer I genuinely want to watch this movie just for the fuck of it (when it hits streaming services)
gaming,"Jesus man, they fucked it."
gaming,"Sonic heroes wasn’t so bad, there was also that sonic game on the Wii, I can’t remember the name, but it was an enjoyable game"
gaming,"pfft, J recently had someone afk because his support got the kill."
gaming,"Sonic 2: Chemical Plant Zone

https://youtu.be/-LYB7iLZNWE"
gaming,"It's about time a raccoon made its way to the big screen. I mean, sure, Marvel had a hamster but that's not quite the same..."
gaming,"That is completely false, RT never let people review movies early, only let people say whether they wanted to see the movie or not"
gaming,"His cheeks arnt fat enough to make it work. 
He’s not all round, he’s not fat enough in general. It’s like egg man got old and hit the gym a bit"
gaming,"He was never alive, S.O.N.I.C. was a vessel created for kirby to travel quickly on land discreetly without using a warp star."
gaming,This is a cursed image.
gaming,"He’s from another planet/dimension/something in the trailer though. I feel like that excuses the one-eye thing. Just make him go back to the way he was, PLEASE"
gaming,Synchronise your death watches
gaming,"When I first started playing ranked I got up to Gold 1.

Three months later I was down to bronze 3. 

Now I'm a solid Gold 2 again!"
gaming,‘‘Twas a simpler time
gaming,"Dunkey, is that you?"
gaming,Was redstone in the game 10 years ago?
gaming,More games should do things like this; Reward platinums with exclusive avatars and themes. Would make me brush the dust off my trophy hunting rifle.
gaming,Let's not forget that he was also *dead* during that scene.
gaming,"Ya, that show.  Wonder what happened to that rumoured live action movie though."
gaming,"Good job, when my now 9 year old turned 5 we started playing Minecraft together on console. We spent the whole summer playing every day. She'll be turning 10 soon and we still play 3-4 times a month, it's a great game for creative minds."
gaming,He must fight Kevin spacey
gaming,This is actually amazing
gaming,"Xbox one.  we had our second baby girl born in December and I just haven't had a chance to play, glad she discovered it."
gaming,I actually want to watch this on streaming but then again I barely know shit about the history lol
gaming,Is vr coming to this game? If not then it should.
gaming,"Microsoft: Fuck you, thats what happened."
gaming,"i dont know, it there?"
gaming,One of my all time favorites. I've replayed it at least 20 times.
gaming,"There is a pretty cool game of thrones mod for attila total war, if that interests you. Idk much about I just know it's a thing."
gaming,"I wouldn't say he's *extremely* versatile, but I didn't mean to imply that his roles were all the same.  He makes 'Jim Carrey' work in a lot if different roles, unlike actors such as oldschool Clint Eastwood who basically starred as himself.  

My point is more that we can, on a base level, predict how he's gonna approach Robotnik and it's not likely to be a dud role no matter how they write the character.  I'm pretty sure his more comedic roles are heavily ad libbed anyway."
gaming,I mean...a video game movie isn’t exactly an original production.
gaming,You got turned into rare candies along side all those metapods you “release”
gaming,if story and voice acting is why people play sonic then i think i understand why the fanbase seems to always be upset.
gaming,Outward is great but I can almost guarantee that if you play dragon’s dogma after you’ll find yourself wondering why you didn’t play it sooner - especially if you like playing a mage/sorcerer character.
gaming,"I get what you're saying, but I think there are two huge differences between Detective Pikachu and Sonic.

The first is that the Pokemon look weird because it's jarring to see those designs rendered realistically, whereas Sonic's design is just awful regardless of whether you're familiar with the source material. The Pokemon designs have grown on me in a way that I doubt Sonic every will.

The second is that the Detective Pikachu trailers are competently edited and the beats land. The jokes actually feel like jokes, the action and spectacle looks exciting, the music works, they're paced well. The Sonic trailer is... the opposite of all that. They somehow made Jim Carrey Jim Carreying it up in a ridiculous costume not funny in the slightest."
gaming,"Ah, another victim of EA"
gaming,I haven't had issues yet but if you are worried about some of the really bad bugs I'd say wait a month or two if you can. I ended up doing that Kingdom Come Deliverance and it was basically bug free by the time I got to it and I didn't have to go through those frustrations.
gaming,"Lol, you'll have to wait until November like everyone else! This is just the trailer.

I'm sure he'll like it."
gaming,Its called Sonic....I mean what did you expect him to look like.
gaming,It looks like it will give you a hug if you walk up to it
gaming,Sonic makes Will Smith's Genie look great.
gaming,Just like this post
gaming,LoL back in the day that's still league now
gaming,"This comment reminds me of the new woody wood pecker, just own that shit or fail."
gaming,"It’s from Always Sunny In Philadelphia, a TV show"
gaming,"your not wrong, she's in the top 98% in her height/weight.  my entire family and my wife's family are all proportionally large."
gaming,I just scrape it off with a plain tortilla chip. Why waste money on Doritos when I can get cheaper cantina chips that I can season myself with myself?
gaming,At least give the OP cred for the meme
gaming,Me after eating the Carolina Reaper
gaming,"With the magic of cgi, this can be done!"
gaming,I once clicked it too many times for the 4th time and just turned the game off. I then realized that I didn't save since Pewter city. I was level 30 something at that point.
gaming,*snorts cocaine* WHAT THE FUCK IS A SONIC!?
gaming,Looks like box office poison.
gaming,Made better by the Hollywood legend that Luigi was consistently sauced during filming.
gaming,"He'd better say ""I hate that hedgehog"" at some point in an extremely exaggerated, teeth-clenched way, like Jim Carrey is known for, or I will be disappointed."
gaming,I didn't know that was a tranq gun at first and thought that Sonic was literally bout to get gatted down
gaming,I actually really liked Mario Bros. 🤷‍♂️
gaming,"I'm a little rusty on my characters, but I'm guessing that's the Sonic CD iteration of Amy on the left? IIRC, that's how she looked in the days before Sonic Adventure gave her the makeover that we know of today.

I kinda like this old design, actually. In a way, it reminds me of more oldschool female cartoon character designs, with a bit more class than the current iteration of Amy."
gaming,It was a fucking ambush
gaming,Bradley Pierce (kid from Jumanji) does the voice of Chip (the kid teapot) in Beauty and the Beast costarring with Frank Welker as the voice of the footstool (he also voiced Nibler). And of course Frank Welker was in Balto with none other than Kevin Bacon.
gaming,I still haven’t found a solution to “can’t remember who I loaned my Dreamcast to”...
gaming,i cant wait to introduce Minecraft to her.
gaming,"It's extremely engaging. ""Fun"" isn't exactly the right word, but it feels so good to play. Until your midlaner starts shouting racial slurs. That's less fun."
gaming,"It’s not even the animation, it’s the design. It’s just so bad. It looks so weird. They took a cartoon hedgehog and for some reason tried to make it look way too human and in the process tossed it screaming into the darkest bowels of the uncanny valley. Whoever approved the design it should be ashamed, and whoever *did* the design should be shot."
gaming,"Yeah thats the thing 😐

Hopefully it comes on netflix at least, till then i wouldnt mind watching it"
gaming,"You are wrong, you could post reviews for movies not yet released. [Source](https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/26/18241312/rotten-tomatoes-movie-review-changes)"
gaming,I fucking love it honestly. Cannot wait to watch the movie!!
gaming,"Man, I've put a bunch of hours into Tetris/Puyo Puyo for Switch and I am still just as horrible now as I was back then."
gaming,When ops pic is such high res it shames the Paramount one lol.
gaming,Since 2013. It's been in the game longer than it hasn't been.
gaming,"Dunkey, is that you?"
gaming,Shes not new just reworked. Like Galio and Aatrox
gaming,People saying he is addicted LOL player. I think he is just DOTA 2 player.
gaming,How can life get any worse at this point?
gaming,"You're walking in the woods, 

There's no one around and your phone is dead

Out of the corner of your eye you spot him:

Shia LaBeouf."
gaming,You should try mania.
gaming,That is a bold statement
gaming,"Way to oversimplify my statement, take a lap"
gaming,"Yeah, it wasn't absolutely true to the source, but he'll that was an awesome movie! It's so  much fun and totally entertaining. Shame on you for trying to compare it to... this!"
gaming,My favorite game was the shrek game
gaming,Why is this marked as NSFW lmao
gaming,"1) side note, love your username

2) it's true, over the years even to the old side scrollers the themes have been amazing and iconic. Def showing the later legacy games we know and love that music is a key part today the gaming experience. 

R.I.P MJ"
gaming,"Or just normal humans with ice guns.

Like. Ok?

Its...a cloud of ice.

That moves...what?

10 feet per second? Maybe?

 #HARDFLASHCOUNTER."
gaming,Its hard to keep the frustration in sometimes but i bite my tongue.
gaming,"If I remember right, I think you can jump on the ropes if it's giving you a real problem"
gaming,*ABOVE AND  B E Y O N D*
gaming,Pretty sure Heroes of Newerth is better.
gaming,I was thinking of a blue version of thing 1 and 2 from the Mike Myers cat in the hat
gaming,I dont have a PC unfortunately
gaming,I'm putting hours into hots already so I'm afraid to try lol
gaming,"Tbh, growing up with modern Sonic, I don't see Eggman as ""fat"". I'd know what fat is, cuz I'm very much so. Eggman is more ... eggshaped. Like an otherwise normal dude, but with the biggest beerbelly ever, not fat all over.

That'd look fine as a cartoon. Realistically, that describes 2006 Eggman though, and ... man that's even more of an nightmare than this movie's Sonic."
gaming,I tried that and ended up running off the side of them ...
gaming,Um excuse me my 7yr old is very excited about this movie thank you very much.
gaming,Your overall point seemed to be that Hollywood is unoriginal lately. A point I agree with. I was actually trying to bolster your point about unoriginality.
gaming,Heroes of the storm has the added advantage of not having to deal with either dota players or league players.
gaming,"I... disagree about Sonic Adventure 2, aside from the first level, but there have been multiple good ones since then. Sonic Generations, in particular, was very good."
gaming,"As a casual gamer myself I couldn't play online because it seems like the other people there do nothing but play all day and are extremely good, after getting annihilated over and over it wasn't fun. Some have suggested joining other servers but I haven't tried that yet."
gaming,Personally I enjoyed Sonic Generations and Sonic Mania MUCH more than any Sonic Adventure game.
gaming,A good rogue-lite game is soul knight.
gaming,"To be fair, it's no worse than most things Sonic Team has created."
gaming,"Come on movie makers! This commercial did it better too:

https://youtu.be/S8UEOk_wpNY"
gaming,thank you i will try my best
gaming,That is still your best bet. Take your time with it. I lost over 70 lives to that level before remembering the ropes.
gaming,Thats how i make my hair gel
gaming,"I'm doing the same also but with other video games. Trying to do Mario Bros 1-3 &amp; SMW sprites of small Mario, an iconic powerup from that game, a brick block and question mark block"
gaming,"Eh, unless I see actual pics of it happening, I find it hard to believe"
gaming,"I strongly suspect that they saw the rest of the script - the non-authentic and ALSO unoriginal Robotnik, the bland machines, the human cast that makes Transformers' look competent - and decided to just let it burn."
gaming,"You can, that's not my point. Trademarking and Branding are very tight for some companies. For example, Pepsi trademarked the colours in their logo so for product placement they would probably have some strict guidelines for the use of their product. Pretty much every company you can think of is like that.

It turns out that the shoe in the trailer is a Puma (I was going on this picture) so if Puma said: ""we will sponsor you but he has to wear a realistic version of our shoes"" then the design would have to change to make those sponsor bucks."
gaming,"I dont know what youre planning to do there, but i think gloves should suffice."
gaming,Ben shwartz? More like Ben ^(i want to die) ***lol Xd 😂😂😂🤪🤪🤪😭😭🤣🤣😫🥚😁😂😂😂***
gaming,With that logic though why wouldn’t the design cater to older fans? If the kids it’s targeting wouldn’t care either way wouldn’t it seem smarter to appeal to a larger audience instead of making a  massive effort to steer so clear of the original design?
gaming,If it came out in the 90’s with the rest labelled as sonic 4 or similar I’d have lost my shit. It’s fantastic..
gaming,"Nice, I pretty much just find other peoples patterns I like and go for it."
gaming,thank you really encouraged me. thank you soo much
gaming,"I really liked my psp, i was poor in high school so i could never buy games"
gaming,I gave up on it for a while... played through the entire second game and almost finished the third one too and went back to it and still am stuck on it... I’ll get through it but my god is it frustrating
gaming,When you finally find that magical owl in GTA.
gaming,So all you have to do now is put info on a nice looking graphic and say it was leaked and people believe you? What a time to be alive.
gaming,"Makes the title of the post ""This movie is trash""...

Must have travelled back in time to tell us his opinion of the movie because no one has actually seen it yet due to the fact that it hasn't come out yet..."
gaming,"There is a problem in character design through the games. Triss in 1st and 2nd games was Yen-substitute in half of her behavior. Especially in 1st game. In Witcher 3, where we have real Yennefer, all that Triss can afford is being cute, as all other feature of her character were given back to their rightful owner."
gaming,I’ll forever associate “thank you very much” with Brie Larson .
gaming,"He...actually looks more like Sanic that he does the actual official design for Sonic.

How does that even happen...?"
gaming,"unpopular opinion: i don't mind the new sonic design and i thought the trailer was good. the only thing i didn't like was the gangster's paradise theme song. it's so unfitting and the song itself didn't age well either. like common, it seems like a real missed opportunity to use a re-mix of the original green hill zone song."
gaming,He looks like the kid from Jumanji after he gets turned into a monkey.
gaming,"is this just in regards to the community? because yeah I do think the community in dota is pretty bad, but that just comes with the territory"
gaming,I think the movie looks like fun midday TV with the kids on the weekend. Not sure if I’d pay to watch it though.
gaming,\**cough*\* \**clear throat*\* **Enter button**
gaming,"&gt;	I’m pretty sure

This is the part of the meme that forever haunts me."
gaming,"I was going to say that it reminded me of a blue version of Mike Myers as the cat in the hat. But you're right, it is even closer to those abominations."
gaming,Someone felt really smart when they came up with that.
gaming,"Ayy that's me . Used to be a tryhard , got into diamond s5 . Quitted playing a few months ago for 2 reasons: got frustrated with the game , cannot enjoy it like i used to be even when i tried to chilled . Second is im in my final at uni and life is getting busier and busier."
gaming,"*The one part that would’ve made the trailer not a complete disappointment 

FTFY"
gaming,"i'll stick to shooting heroin up my ass, thanks"
gaming,"I mean if you played so much it's probably just not for you. It may be dependent on which you start with but for me I could never tolerate what seems to me overly simple, especially as I haven't even played dotes in a while and am not feeling the desire to even with battlepass/TI coming up."
gaming,"There is a reskin version om SNES too, Kirby's Avalanche."
gaming,"I saw Detective Pikachu last week. Im not going to say this is completely off base but.... well, all i can say is you need to stay for the after credit scene."
gaming,"I am not a particular fan of league, but this argument is inherently flawed. ""Deeper"" is meaningless here, because both games are far too deep to be played optimally; the depth created by compounding even a small set of mechanics with each other is easily in advance of what humans can comprehend, so saying DotA is deeper than league is like saying starcraft is deeper than chess."
gaming,"Your not. I saw the trailer, and instanly found a friend at work and they watched it too. We both got super stoked, and we're very surprised by the negative reponses"
gaming,"Dang, Sammy06 really grew up!"
gaming,"Grew up in Indiana, it was pop. Live in Iowa, now it's soda. Not so much all of midwest. More of a state by state thing."
gaming,"I have the AO San Andreas and used to have Manhunt 2. 

Haven’t seen any AOs outside of a few."
gaming,"Balanced, as all things should be."
gaming,Incoming Tron crossover that no one asked for
gaming,"Still love that movie, but man is it a hard watch now. Such terrible, terrible acting. BUT, Goro..."
gaming,Sonic and the Secret Rings was the only Sonic game I've ever played.
gaming,"Ima mechanical, ima mechanical, I’m a mechanical man."
gaming,Why you gotta throw shade on HotS like that?
gaming,He’s honestly looks like they try to make him human then add all his hedgehog feature later
gaming,It's fun with a group of friends. Other than that? Not so much
gaming,Must be a dota player
gaming,If we attack this from any angle it'll just be more normal-ass sonic
gaming,A freeze frame. You literally chose the one pose that doesn’t look cool.
gaming,Where were you the day God stopped paying attention and let this ^ shit slip through the cracks?
gaming,"**""Ah shit, here we go again...""**"
gaming,"It's probably the angle, but this shot actually looks pretty decent to me.  Not good, just...not horrifying, per se.  But that other shot with the teeth...oh, the teeth..."
gaming,"“*Soldier, what are y- A CIVILIAN?? WHAT IS A CIVILIAN DOING ON THIS BASE? I’LL HAVE SOMEONE’S ASS FOR DINNER! GET THIS CIVILIAN OFF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY!*”"
gaming,But everyone still gonna watch the movie just because it has sonic
gaming,Her(???) eyes scream previous traumatic experiences. What has happened in her life to produce such a malicious picture?
gaming,and they were only slightly more sanitary than licking a dog's asshole
gaming,I don't know. I loved it for 2 or 3 years. Last time I tried to play it was just shit to me. That said I'm really not big on multiplayer games anymore.
gaming,Right? It's basically impossible for 2 or more people to independently come up with the same idea. What a stupid concept.
gaming,Literally everything he did or said was gold. I watched the VHS for that so much as a kid when I saw it on bluray I had to buy it then and there.
gaming,[You call that a long link? Now here's a long link.](https://d9nvuahg4xykp.cloudfront.net/-5532739316566377918/-7897737142073531794.jpg)
gaming,"Yup, fuck it. Bout to stream it aswell"
gaming,WHEN WILL YOU LEARN
gaming,The fact that we can now go around memeing about Sonic be tranquilized makes me jubilant.
gaming,"Well, you can't anymore, as explained in the source I provided. It had been going on for years before that though, I'm surprised you would be so adamant to deny it, it was super common."
gaming,No cartridge. The gameboy logo is different if there’s a cartridge in the slot.
gaming,I don't think his needles should look so much like hair. But I getcha.
gaming,"But, he could scare the competion away with his face. *taps head*"
gaming,We got a Raul Lilja as M Bison situation going on here.
gaming,"Everyone will either tell you their moba is less toxic or all mobas are this toxic, but, speaking as a heavy League player who spent several years in heroes of the storm, the difference is night and day. I have as many flaming players in a typical week of LoL as I did in three  years of HotS, and that's not an exaggeration. If the community is what's turning you away from the genre, try Heroes.

edit: typo"
gaming,This was the first PC game I played that wasn’t bouncing babies to an ambulance as they were flung from a burning building on DOS.
gaming,"Nuke it from orbit, just to be sure"
gaming,"I personally dislike his acting, and dislike him in the majority of his movies.

Typically I find the plot carries him, not the other way around.

But everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I just personally don't care for him in movies."
gaming,"The only way I play Minecraft is with gameRule keepInventory true. It's the only way to enjoy the game without constant rage quits. I can say ""Golly that was a dumb mistake"" and resume basically where I left off instead of quitting the game for a few months."
gaming,It looks like the live action cat in the hat got into heroin and paint sniffing
gaming,"I remember these, and loved them. I also miss the Target game watching stations; was the first time laid my eyes on my favorite game of all time: Chrono Trigger. Good times :')"
gaming,Why tf he look like Katie from the Horton Hears a Who
gaming,"You do know this is a recent picture, right?"
gaming,I always thought tails was Sonic's girlfriend or something when I was a kid.
gaming,I think dota is an order of magnitude more likely.
gaming,Its pure white fluff. ♡
gaming,"It’s giving me Ghostbusters 2016 vibes. You know, where you watch a trailer and you just instantly know how big of a garbage fire it’s going to be."
gaming,Your fault for buying that overpriced garbage
gaming,Look how they massacred my boy
gaming,"I'm also reminded of the live-action How the Grinch Stole Christmas aesthetic, mostly in the way that [the nose rounds down to the mouth](https://www.uphe.com/sites/default/files/2015/04/Dr-Seuss-How-The-Grinch-Stole-Christmas-Gallery-3.jpg)."
gaming,"Not really, I fundamentally disagree with you. The depth of skill and strategy becomes glaring to me when comparing and contrasting the pro scenes. But judging from the other comments you've made in this thread your opinion isn't going to change and I can't be fucked arguing about comparisons for fucking videogames."
gaming,"I edited my original comment (perhaps too late, I was busy) but it was Puma in the official trailer.

Anyway, I'm not trying to blame Nike or Puma. The studio still designed him that way, I'm just saying that if you want a kid to buy your shoes ""because sonic wears them"" you want them to be recognizable. There are good reasons to have guidelines on product placement, it's up to the studio to figure out if those guidelines are a good fit for the movie."
gaming,Wanna know what addiction really is? Play Factorio.
gaming,So it's not just me?
gaming,"This is gonna jumpstart so many fetishes, isn't it?  Man, I'm scared."
gaming,"I play league since i do enjoy it. Same with Dota 1 when it was just some starcraft mode, Dota 2 just seems so “soulless” to me it really doesn’t have an appeal for me. People like you do though definitely do not help in the regard of garnering new players."
gaming,That needs to stop or we’ll keep getting really bad movies.
gaming,"I mean, to be fair, if you play a jungler, you should spend five minutes on google learning what that means."
gaming,Neither is a comic book movie and yet Marvel seems to have a handle on them.
gaming,"Let's just pretend that this movie will be not about Sonic, but about Robotnik and how he became bald."
gaming,"Sonic fans have it tough. There are seriously some gems in the series, and so they know that the games absolutely can be great, but it's not something they usually get.

But, hey, at least Sonic Mania happened."
gaming,There is the wayback machine :P
gaming,why do i have to suffer again but even worse now
gaming,"Sonic 06 was bad because of the coding, not the bestiality."
gaming,"This one pissed me off 20 years ago and it pissed me off again last year lol
 
#you can do it!"
gaming,thirty or so million people and the largest esports community in the world disagree with you.
gaming,I the his face.
gaming,"Lol, ""quick"" game of league."
gaming,“They” didn’t make sonic mania; that’s why it’s so much better than the other recent sonic games.  Sega only published it but did not design or direct it.
gaming,"Rouge :p

If you think the Knuckles/Rouge levels are bad, try learning how to speedrun them!"
gaming,When can we have a good Sonic... Anything?
gaming,My friend and I are seeing this on a Tuesday.  And copious amounts of alcohol and weed will be consumed beforehand.
gaming,"The ones you've done are pretty good, I've only got 4 boards + one completely warped one that is basically unusable . Yeah I shouldve used the tape method before hand"
gaming,My daughter likes Chutes &amp; Ladders
gaming,"Not to mention Jim carry's pathetic attempt as a comeback after being a douche nozzle ""provocative artist""."
gaming,Must be stuck in iron.
gaming,"""Don't call anyone!!!"" *Sprays him in the face*"
gaming,"I guess his style is not for everyone. I used to watch all his videos but nowadays I often skip some, because he just repeats the same stuff I heard so many times already (plus even his more positive videos are written in a very cynical and complaining way - it can get exhausting at times.)

Btw I feel the same about the Extra Credit channel. I *want* to like them, their videos seem super informative, but f\*in hate that fake tinny voice. (Though now that I checked their channel, they seem to have stopped using it over the last year? Maybe I can start watching their newer videos.)"
gaming,DotA is for people who derive their self-worth from video games.
gaming,I never said it was?
gaming,This is my favorite
gaming,"Really? If anything, I'd vote for Batman Vs. Superman to have not happened."
gaming,As opposed to a child in pyjamas?
gaming,"That's it! He has no eyebrows or brow bone! It's just one big frigging flat surface. That's why it's so freaky.  

Even if the eyes weren't joined, big eyes and brow definition would've made it better probably"
gaming,Ain't no lobos out here
gaming,Some one please tell me where I can get one of these. Asap
gaming,"It actually looks like a fursuit, what the heck?"
gaming,You can't just say 'unplotholed' a bunch of times and expect it to fix the plot hole
gaming,"Was just about to ask that. I've played Emerald and Fire Red tons of times, but I don't remember a single Pokemon Center with a counter in the lower right. Most likely a ROM hack."
gaming,The ropes are the way to do it!
gaming,That looks a million times better! Why can a person with photoshop create something better in two minutes than a company that's putting forth millions of dollars. I just don't get it.
gaming,like one of those movies they showed on Sunday evenings with shitloads of commercials.
gaming,Well tell his mom that we'll be in the forest when he gets home from soccer practice!
gaming,It's the largest esport in the world and maintains one of the largest player bases in the world. I'm a bit bitter about it.
gaming,Technically spines are specialized hairs.
gaming,"Yeah, asking for a Coke when you mean a Coke (or it's counter part is acceptable and also not regional). It's asking for a Coke when you mean as you said, Dr. Pepper, Sprite, etc.

I wouldn't really refer to what your doing as calling pop (soda) a coke. You are asking for a Coke or something similar and have no preference on brand (many people do). I have cousins from Georgia that call everything Coke, that's referring to it as a Coke."
gaming,Oh yeeeeaaahh. Forgot that. I miss jumping over walls with Aatrox
gaming,"Joel, Mike and Jonah seem to being pretty good at it"
gaming,Winston was a wise man.
gaming,"Literally anything else.  
Right now it's teeing up to be an Airbender."
gaming,Are there enough people that like Sonic for them to make a damn movie? Did Hollywood run out of ideas.
gaming,Brawl Stars very good
gaming,That look when the game save file is gone
gaming,Looks like kingdom come deliverance
gaming,I never played the first one when it was originally out... they did confirm they made the games harder too when they remastered them so this seems ridiculous
gaming,"I found HotS to not suck, but I play league now instead. I'm not too bright."
gaming,"You are one of today's lucky 10,000: https://i.imgur.com/ww0IvVH.jpg"

gaming,I loved playing this game with my brothers so many memeories!!!

gaming,Buy a 20yo console if you want that.
gaming,GG you succcccccccc kidddddddddddd
gaming,This is what happens when you anthropomorphise shit.... something always looks off
gaming,"Playing on the couch, laying back and relaxing after a long day."
gaming,The only good thing about LoL is the porn
gaming,They’re appealing to the 90’s gen. gonna go out in a limb here and wager that this is brim w/vague call backs to the last time anyone has ever bought a sonic game
gaming,It's most likely Fire Red/Leaf Green.
gaming,There is a disappointing amount of truth there.
gaming,Pokemon only has like 100000x more fans than Sonic
gaming,"The amount of ""game over""s I got on those levels was too damn high... I refuse to even attempt the time trial cause I know it'll just piss me right off all.over again haha"

gaming,It's starting to look like lazy town. With more furries.
gaming,Can confirm. Spent probably 5k hours playing.
gaming,"Don’t feel bad, you improved it"
gaming,Sonic Mania was pretty cool
gaming,This is probably going to be as bad as the upcoming doom movie. Even the game developers want nothing to do with it...
gaming,"Same, in Plano Texas there's one"
gaming,"children and the most profitable esports community in the world. Also, remind me which one has computers beating the pro humans now?"
gaming,Cradle of filth if you ask me. So I have no idea what he is talking about.
gaming,That’s ok my guess is the game was canceled or didn’t make it past that trailer for one reason or another.
gaming,"Sitting on the couch,  Chilling with a controller. Also easier to do with friends and split screen. And on a big tv."
gaming,To reiterate. How did this get approved by people who want to make money?
gaming,Right. Should’ve been the other way or something? 🤷🏼‍♂️
gaming,"When will they learn?
I don't care if they have to make it a furrier version of dbz just make it INTERESTING or FUN"

gaming,"Why is it no one else mentions Yennefer to Geralt in the first game though? I find it really strange that Dandelion never brings up Yennefer. There's probably a few other characters that would know of her that say nothing.

I can see the interpretation that Triss is lying to Geralt. But, the complete lack of any mention comes across to me as either an oversight or CDPR just didn't want her to come up at all. I guess it's possible at that point they didn't know if they were actually gonna have her appear in a future game."
gaming,Console because I never have to fart around with drivers or get a new video card or ram upgrade to run a game.
gaming,If I hear Sonic say **”DID I DO THAaAaAaAT?”** I will lose my shit.
gaming,"Jesus, the left looks like something out of ‘don’t hug me I’m scared’"
gaming,I think they might do the whole Dr. Kintobor into Robotnik
gaming,"I prefer pc because I can couch game with it using wireless dualshock controllers or sit at the keyboard and mouse. And do other things when I'm not gaming. Couch gaming on pc is as easy as feeding your signal to the TV. 

I used to require a console for fighting games because pc ports of those were done by fly by night studios, but no longer.

A console would not add any benefit to my ecosystem at all, though I respect anyone that plays games as a baseline rule."
gaming,"the trick is to press a until you say ""yes."" then, you spam b."
gaming,"I wasn’t quoting dracula, i was quoting thor..."
gaming,"If Nolan's trilogy hadn't, that wouldn't've. Casual observers of Batman that didn't understand the character went to a movie by a famous director who also didn't understand the character, and they walked away thinking it was great when it was only a half-baked crime thriller that was relatively new to them, thus why they mistakenly believe the interpretations of the characters was good, let alone serviceable.

Man of Steel, BvS, and Justice League were the unfortunate consequences of executives thinking a financially successful misrepresentation would be a good formula to copy-and-paste on the rest of the DCU. As much as Batman can profit from grim-and-gritty, Nolan's vision was misguided and uninspired, and translating that to Superman with Zack Snyder at the wheel was disgraceful, to say the least."
gaming,Yes exactly that is my opinion on it as well
gaming,"no, bone is made of calcium, not keratin lol"
gaming,"That is fascinating, I'm honestly interested in movie trailers that you think looked bad."
gaming,"Oh, sorry to hear."
gaming,"I dislike the tape method. What I do is iron one side the minimum amount and flip it off my pegboard real quick, put weights on the beads so they don't warp, and if the board is hot I do the same to it."
gaming,"So you mean to say...

Why the fuck didn’t he look like Sonic?"
gaming,"Thank God we don't have fans making this shit. Thank God we are still capitalists, and can just own fucking ideas, and ruin them, because boomers don't know what fucking Sonic is..."
gaming,Don't argue with the troll.
gaming,"I haven’t seen this movie, but it sounds like it’s gonna be a rental for me."

gaming,These comments saying I like to play on the couch laying in bed on a big TV. You can do that with a PC it's not 1984 you dont have to know everything about computers anymore they basically just work now
gaming,Am i the only one who actually loves the way it turned out in the trailer?
gaming,"The trailer *is* trash.

The movie *will be* trash."
gaming,TIL that there are still sonic fans.
gaming,"Just wait til you see the video game tie-in, Sonic the Hedgehog: The Movie: The Game."
gaming,So this movie is equally afraid of us?
gaming,"To be fair, sonic doesn’t look as bad as we thought."
gaming,I mean the one benefit is the fact that the Pokemon movie is *in* *their* world. It's Ryme City. Not New York City. This Sonic movie takes place like here in America
gaming,"He said shower, every shower has a shower beer, it's implied."
gaming,"But thor was paraphrasing dracula, so I win. 

Nyeer."
gaming,"I would say that it's also arguable whether sonic adventure 2 is a great game or not. 

Sure, many may have fun with it, but the mech levels are boring and the treasure hunting levels are usually only okay (except for pumpkin hill).

Really, the only saving graces of the game are the sonic/shadow levels, the chao garden, and the memeable cutscenes."
gaming,The truth always is.
gaming,Said every League player ever.
gaming,And yet it makes perfect sense for the live action version of so many of these creatures.
gaming,I had one for 3 months and it's definitely not as bad as you make it out to be. Could it be better? Of course.
gaming,"Without a doubt pc. But my pc is an absolute beast machine:

I7 8700k at 4.9
32gb 3200mhz ram
Asus maximus x hero
Evga 1080ti sc2 with ÷75/÷375oc
1tb m.2 ssd
Acer xg270hu 1440p 144hz monitor"
gaming,"I remember them being there but they were like the frozen yogurt means, never working."
gaming,"Right, I'm like at what rate will my shity laptop die.  Ok, put it one below that."
gaming,"Honestly my biggest issue is that he had fur on his hands instead of gloves, like how is fur a better idea or easier to animate?"
gaming,Pokemon center's are the reason I spam B instead of A.
gaming,This guy is still mad cause i KS his kill in lane and took a minion wave.
gaming,"He might enjoy Dark Souls, Sekiro, Bloodbourne. 

The Last of Us was extremely well received. 

Check what’s on sale in Steam to maybe get a few deals on a couple games"
gaming,mario bros at least had that dinosaur song.
gaming,Shit like this is why SEGA went bankrupt.
gaming,"I prefer console as well. Nothing I'm interested in playing requires that bit extra of power and I don't have any interest in the PC building side of things. I would rather just get my game and know it will work. As far as I can tell, the only PC-exclusive games are RTS's and MMO's, neither of which strike my fancy, while there are a number of console exclusive games that I definitely wanted to play (The Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted 4, Bloodborne, Persona 5, etc). Not really a fan of WASD as a way of handling movement controls. I like an analog stick for that much better. Not that there's anything wrong with playing on PC. Just a matter of preference."
gaming,I know there are a ton. Just seemed like a kool idea. But someone already pointed out why it wouldnt make sense so my dreams have already been crushed. Haha.
gaming,Hey I met Sonic with Sonic Heroes :( loved the game lol also it was among my first game
gaming,"You're absolutely right, the really rare and expensive cards aren't legal in Modern. That's why modern decks tend to be in the $500-$1500 range, approximately. Legacy and Vintage decks are significantly more expensive on average.  A deck like Legacy Lands will run you more like $5000."
gaming,"My manhunt 2 is mature, was there another version? :0"
gaming,"Honestly if i had the knowledge to figure out getting a good pc set up, and linked to my tv, and then to be able to connect controllers to it, then it’d be no question that PC was better. Just seems like too much between work and school that it’d feel like another job. Not to mention the cost of a complete setup."
gaming,"&gt;""This thing is trash because I don't like it, throw it away""

gaming,Look how they massacred my boy
gaming,"I have heard really good things about that, but I thought it was shut down?"
gaming,He played Kierstan Dunst's brother in two movies? Do they share a universe?
gaming,Nope. He only directed two Batman films.
gaming,Ok. None of the one's I ever went into did.
gaming,"idk What either of those things are : ). So, I can’t say I was thinking of them. I know it was LoL. She never spoke of gameplay. She’d just discuss how she’d play the game all night and she’d lose or win often. My vision I discussed was just what I kind of hoped it was due to the shortened acronym. I do remember her being surprised I didn’t know what LoL was and that I never asked her before she spoke the name in full. I told her that , based on the way she talked, this was a popular game and I didn’t wanna look stupid for not knowing it.  I didn’t really play computer games back then. I remember her telling me that it was a free game but many people spend money playing it, herself included."
gaming,"Honestly yeah i get that id just rather not need to learn how between work and school, thatd be like another job whereas on console i just plug in and play. Not to mention reseraching, picking/building my own pc. All of that sounds like way too much effort to me"
gaming,"It's not like it's the first time Sonic has been shafted. Sonic '06, anyone?"
gaming,It was $6.... and I’ve seen at least 6 memes about the game... so take the co-sign of 6 /6 you get worth a shot right?
gaming,"Is Bob Hoskins in Sonic? No, he is not.   


Good day to you, sir."
gaming,"Luigi: ""Mario, we gotta go to dino city and save da Princess!""    
Mario: ""I'm too drunk to deal with this s*it!"""
gaming,Isn't that because Ciri's mom is some sort of elf-descendant?
gaming,"I'm not sure. The object is pluralized (attorneys, courts) while the descriptor isn't (general, martial). But in the case of an N64, 64 is the name of the console and Nintendo is a descriptor saying which company created it. I think it would still be Nintendo 64s."
gaming,My kids said this trailer looked terrible. Then I showed them the trailer for the Super Mario Brothers movie.
gaming,I don’t know what that is. Is this possibly a joke I’m missing? I’m sorry.
gaming,"Video Game movies can work. The problem is that no one in Hollywood is willing to give Video Game (or Anime) adaptations as much effort and attention as Book and Comic adaptations often get.

&amp;#x200B;

When Marvel want to make a new film franchise, they find an indie director with a good track record and let them direct it.

&amp;#x200B;

When say, Capcom wants to make a new film franchise, they just sorta pick a director or two out of a hat and go ""make this movie"". (There's a Mega Man movie coming out being directed by the people that made a hit documentary and a mediocre thriller, not really who you'd want making something as important as Mega Man.)"
gaming,Look at how they've massacred my boy
gaming,You know how the plot is going to play out. He's just normal fast in the first 2 acts and isn't fast enough to stop Jim Carrey. In the 3rd act he'll get some speed boost that allows him to be as fast as Quicksilver in the X-Men movie.
gaming,Xenominer. It's Minecraft in space.
gaming,Rubbing two bits of clay together is more likely to spark something
gaming,"Fork you, now I can’t unsee that. As if this CGI Eldritch horror wasn’t terrifying enough."
gaming,I tried doing something similar but it just wouldn't work. Tape method is easiest so you don't tamper with the board. I would make more Mario sprites except I ran out if tan beads
gaming,"Unable to comply, building in progress"
gaming,which you can do with either
gaming,"&gt; due to the ""so bad it's good"" effect

that comes in on rentals/streaming. Nobody pays good money in theatres for that shit anymore. 

Last movie to effectively pull that off was *Snakes on a Plane*. And that movie had Samuel L MFin Jackson."
gaming,I thought this. And now I'm reading this thread. Lmao. Thank you
gaming,Thank you for the advice!
gaming,"All of them. They honestly won’t cost much at all if you go to gamestop or something maybe 20-30 all together. Arkham Knight is so good, Far Cry 4 will have you playing for hours, and Borderlands is well it’s borderlands so buy it."
gaming,Bold of you to assume they were thinking.
gaming,What’s more amazing is all the people who have a hot take on this movie like it supposed to be good or something..
gaming,This guy... This guy gets life
gaming,"If Jim Carry and however they wrote sonic plays out correctly, this movie might become a ""so bad it's good"" movie."
gaming,Which were infinitely worse than Nolan's.
gaming,"It's too ingrained in my mind-thumb behavior.

You win this time, Japan."
gaming,You can use any console controller with your PC.
gaming,A sweet headset is always nice my roommate uses turtle beach's and loves them
gaming,"The average cost is almost definitely going to be more than $10, but a lot of modern staples aren't that expensive. Looking at my modern spirits deck, most of the shocks are probably under $10, and most of the creatures are as well and path will be under $10. Of course, then you have fetches, horizon canopy, aether vials, and Noble Hierarchs. It's really a small percentage of the cards accounting for the majority of the cost."
gaming,"You basically took everything i felt and put it into words, while also adding some information that i was unaware of but also supports my opinion. Thanks for the reply!"
gaming,"I wish I could say it’s a joke, it happened."
gaming,"I wanted another Sonic Movie 1999, but even longer and better."
gaming,"Budget?  Some things that gamers like besides specific games are... 

Headsets, gaming mice, gaming and/or mechanical keyboards,  gaming mouse pads, etc.   Just some ideas if he doesn't have any of that stuff."
gaming,Understandable. Have a nice day.
gaming,"I didn't know that for a long time, but I just moved pretty far North and yeah, pop is a thing with the Canadians. Pretty sure Canadians are also robots, but they're pretty alright at being robots. Definitely not goblins."
gaming,"It’s all about the ropes, it’s a pain but your best bet."
gaming,"""But when the world needed him most, he vanished."""
gaming,Honestly I liked the Mario movie. It was bad but good if you know what I mean
gaming,"If only i knew what any of that meant, maybe I’d be a fan of PC too."

gaming,"So, [This dude](https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Uma), then."
gaming,The best part of this trailer was hearing Gangstas paradise
gaming,"Nice, my sister's kids are 5 or six and still have trouble steering the characters"
gaming,It doesnt look had as bad as you are all making it out to be. Will I see it? No. It's a kids movie. Will kids see it and love it? Yes
gaming,Did you just imply Sonic games are good? Lol. Is this meme from the 90's?
gaming,Everyone knows Tails is in Sonic 2.
gaming,I can't wait for the Crash Bandicoot live action film.
gaming,"Ok lemme explain this again, you don't go to a movie for memey movies. They will lose all their money on this movie"
gaming,"Not in every aspect, but fair enough."
gaming,"That game is either pure bliss or straight, unadulterated toxic pain. There is no middle ground."
gaming,Look how they’ve massacred my boy
gaming,Original DoTA ruined WC3 matchmaking. Change my mind...
gaming,"I dunno. Maybe not an airbrushed taxidermy with a bizarrely human mouth. Then again, there's no way this shit was going to look good in live action."
gaming,"I read ""Adaptations"" as ""Abominations"" and it still works."
gaming,"As i’ve heard, fact is i’m not technically versed enough to do anything but press a connect button on the controller and on my console to make sure my wireless controller is connected."
gaming,"As a Sonic fan since colors ds

gaming,"Yea I've kinda noticed, ive returned to smite after like 5 years away from it and first game I got into I pretty much lost the game for my time cause I had 0 clue what I was doing, like I went to the wrong lane that's how clueless I was. 

Despite that the guys were super friendly to me and even after talking to opponents in lobby they were super nice as well. Hope that wasn't a rare occurrence."
gaming,"That part bothered me too.

""Where the fuck was this slow mo 2 minutes ago when he got tranq'd?"""
gaming,There were things Nolan got wrong namely the way he portrayed Gotham and toning down the supernatural and fantastical elements of some of the villains and how he relied more on brute strength than detective work. But out of all ways batman has been portrayed I felt his was the closest.
gaming,"Sonic has existed this long cuz of his amazing unforgettable character design. If Hollywood think they can make it better, they are wrong."
gaming,"Thanks, I’ll definitely think about it."
gaming,Ummmmmm.......can we check this for accuracy?
gaming,What are you on about?? Detective Pikachu looks amazing.
gaming,"I'm not going to buy the movie first of all because it probably isn't a movie worth buying. I don't buy movies I'm only going to watch once. You can rent movies, wait until they are on a streaming service (probably not going to be long for that movie), or use other means to watch it. Also, I talked about watching it with friends, so it's definitely going to cost more than buying once you start adding multiple theater tickets."

gaming,This game was great and the dialogue was hilarious. Wish I could replay it on PC like I can with the sequel.
gaming,"What are you, a ham?"
gaming,"I mean, this kind of stuff is to be expected when you post something like this.

It's terrible, toxic, and I wish it wasn't this way.  But that's what happens when you put something like this out there on a Reddit forum that is filled with people who take absolutely nothing seriously.

Imagine you went to a high school in the south and posted a picture of two men getting married next to the urinals in the boy's bathroom.  It wouldn't go well...  Would be nice if it wasn't that way, though."
gaming,I only ever played the first one which was great and replayed it actually days ago on GBA Emu

Not saying crackdown 3 was a great game it wasn't just pointing out the hypocrisy I see

gaming,There's not much wrong with him being a provocative artist. The fact that he is anti-vax is what makes his comeback attempt pathetic. Idiotic actors who hold lots of sway among the masses like Jim and Tom Cruise (scientologist btw) are a plague.
gaming,U are one lucky man to have a wife like that
gaming,"In live-action movies? *Maybe*.

In movies, including animated? Not by a **long** shot.

In any form of media ever? Please.

EDIT: Aside from the fact that I delivered opinions they didn't like above, this comment is the one that definitely shouldn't receive downvotes. The Batman: Arkham games alone are ***leagues*** better as an interpretation of Batman than anything Nolan could ever shit out, and that's not taking into account years of Batman comics and the animated TV show(s). Some people genuinely think that the Nolan movies were solid interpretations, and for anyone that was greatly disappointed by the live-action Michael Bay TMNT and Transformers movies, you know how this feels."
gaming,Where's the EA one lol
gaming,"I wanna play Heavy Rain, but I only have a PC"

gaming,Time is relative so to him it would seem very slow. Even the press of a trigger could take minutes from his perspective. He can't stop time but he can slow it down relative to him.
gaming,They have so much time to deal with the negative back Lash.  They should take the hit and redo his look.
gaming,"I'm inly going to watch this movie for Jim Carrey. Not in theaters either, waiting for the clearance bin baby."
gaming,What’s with all these negative talks? Mario was a great movie and these movies aren’t just for fans but also an intro for those who are not familiar and gets perspective of these characters. Not everyone is a gamer and this may just be for those to enjoy.

gaming,"Mania was originally being developed by fangame/ROM hack creators. From the Wikipedia page, they had been contracted to help with mobile ports before, but, in essence, they're practically third-party. That's why Mania was good. Sonic Team didn't make it.

Generations, on the other hand... probably only gets as much slack as it does because it has the retro half. Otherwise, it's more of the same shit."
gaming,Live action movies obviously. Does that really need clarification since that was what we were talking about?
gaming,Shitttt I forgot about how stoked i was to play Shadow the Hedgehog when i was a kid! I had totally forgotten about that game!! It was nowhere near as good as Adventure 2 Battle tho.

gaming,"I played league for about 5 years, in those 5 years I also tried to learn dota2 on and off for a few years, same as you I couldnt get used to it at first.


Then I kept trying, and after a few years of playing intermittently something clicked, I started getting used to the ""clunky"" mechanics such as turn rate, long casting and attack animations and realized it was just another part of the game to master, no different from last hitting.

It adds so much depth to a simple thing like trading harrass in lane, should I wait for the enemy to start turning around before I throw my skillshot so he doesnt have time to dodge it? Can I bait him into starting an attack on a creep so he cant immediately retaliate to my poke?


Dota has so much more depth than league in terms of both the micro and macro game. It took me literally years to understand enough of it to get decent, but imo it was worth it. 
No game I have ever played has come close to the complexities and intricacies of dota. 100 hours is barely enough to scratch the surface.


Watch purges dota videos for beginners on youtube if you want to get into it. Theyre outdated but many basic mechanics are still applicable."

gaming,"Huh, well its it's your money but last i checked you can't buy a single joycon and a new set cost around $80."
gaming,You mean to tell me there are legit Sonic fans under 30?
gaming,"There's a female in like half of the scenes; on the roof being held by the guy while sonic Za Warudo's the missles, when he teleports through a ring while they're falling from a sky scraper (why is no one mentioning Sonic makes a giant gold ring that teleports people, like really), and with the gym bag prior the elevator. There is obviously a female lead."
gaming,That jeopardy one gets me every time. Like how do you hear the name Donkey Kong even once and not realize that the first word isn’t just the common animal and not a completely made up word? Did she think the A in Dankey should be pronounced like the A in pAsta? At least she remembered they kind of rhymed.
gaming,"Fun fact, a mcdonalds in the city I live in has gamecube and N64 things in them! Most of them are broken but there's like 2 that still work. The N64 ones are all busted and the only ones that work are mario kart."

gaming,"Yes, but I don't mean that to be condescending. That's the problem, though, there are people out there whose only exposure to the character is through the practically disrespectful aRTiStIc liCeNSe that Nolan took with the characters. It does need to be clarified that Dark Knight, even though its live-action competition hasn't been of great merit (mostly because DC characters don't really belong in live-action, aside from Christopher Reeves as Superman), was *not* a good representation."

gaming,"Oh! Did you mean dark souls? No, I meant what I said. My description of the game in my original comment is just my vision of what I thought the game was with no information. She didn’t discuss gameplay. She just said she’d been playing LoL all night or all day on weekends.  She never got into details because she assumed I knew what it was, since it was popular. She literally spoke the acronym for league of legends (LoL) until I finally wanted to learn more about it. I didn’t play computer games back then. I didn’t have much free time."

gaming,Honestly I fucking loved that game though it had some flaws. Nuts &amp; Bolts 2 with some updated mechanics would have been dope. It's too bad
gaming,"Well, to wit... &gt;!Though Yennefer and Vesemir agreed Uma was suffering from a powerful curse, they could not reach a concensus about how to go about lifting it. Sharp words were exchanged before Vesemir stepped in and announced that before Yennefer did anything he would try one of the traditional witcher methods. 
    All that was left to the others was to wait. 
    Though Vesemir's method had worked to disenchant the famous Swan of Poviss, it brought no breakthrough here. Vesemir did, however, succeed in confirming that Uma's body was a sort of magic prison in which some other being was trapped. 
    Yennefer's method did not prognosticate a high chance for Uma's survival - yet was now the only remaining option for lifting the curse. 
    The ritual succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. The person cursed inside Uma turned out to be none other than Avallac'h, a powerful elven Sage the witcher had met before.!&lt;"

gaming,"you get used to it after a while. some of the dota heroes have a more similar feel to lol champs than others. storm spirit feels a lot like ryze for example.

the difference that really got me (back) into dota is the much more active support role. instead of babysitting your botlane adc and throwing an ult each teamfight, the supports in dota tend to stay pretty active on the map with ganking and whatnot. almost feels more like playing a jungler in lol."

I WAS JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT THE HERO'S BREATH CAPACITY WAS LIKE! JEEZ!"
gaming,They didn’t fuck it up. You just have an inability to separate nostalgia from a story.
gaming,Y'all ever play Sonic 3D Blast? I remember getting two copies of it for my birthday when I was a kid and it was literally unplayable with the Genesis controller. You had to mash the D pad in two different directions to move at all because he moved diagonally. I've never been more upset and utterly defeated by a game in my life.

gaming,"Aren't many of these sequels and remakes and things successful though? I thought that they pushed tickets enough to make the investment worthwhile and that's the only reason they were doing it.  EDIT: Literally just googled a dozen remakes and all of them profited at box office, so there's definitely a trend.

Your argument is that Hollywood thinks they're making valuable changes, but I would argue that they're *not making any changes*. They're changing source material, yes, but more importantly they're intentionally repeating a successful pattern of *remaking old things*. I don't think that they find their work particularly valuable, I think they find that it makes them a lot of the green stuff.

They can cash-in on nostalgia, and it's not even terribly risky. Even the Marvel stuff is kind of nostalgia cash-in, it's just more successful because it's adapting media that several audiences haven't heard the story for yet.

I would attribute a lot of positivity from creators to their remake creations as partially genuine, but primarily PR. It's one thing to say ""yeah, we did a great job animating the Lion King!"" and another to say ""this is a valuable contribution to cinema!"" I can't imagine there's actually as much enthusiasm about this from the creators as we're led to believe, but die-hard fans of franchises will eat anything put on their plate."

Just take the looks of the game, and put it into CG. It was really that simple.

They didn't need to make it look biologically realistic. They needed to make it look 'correct'.

Then you show what the intent is but they can decide what they directly want to use it on.

Some games have transactions within the game itself. So if he plays a game already that he loves, he can invest in ""cool"" extra stuff for that game."
gaming,"They didn't make pvz, popcap did. EA bought it. EA is a publisher, they pay other people to make the games they want and take the credit, and the profit."
gaming,This level caused me to quit playing the games. I never played the originals either so I don’t even know what’s after that. Pretty much lost interest too.

There's no way it would sell if it weren't attached to the Sonic license."

Goodness, how I've come to hate a word. There's never a leak, it's a release of information. I hate how the technology industry has bastardized what was once a real thing when someone snuck out info or accidentally released something. Now it's just clickbait, if not worse."

Sonic ether says he's working on a workaround for this though, so it may be a possibility in the future, just not sure when."

Sonic is still alive. Frustrated, he pushes on, telling himself it was just a dream. November 18th, 2008. The day has finally come. Unleash me from this waking hell! He waits. Sonic remains. The pain in him continues to grow, rising about to explode. How could this be!? Just let him die! Is there nothing I can do to end this suffering!? Third times the charm... that must be the case. November 11th, 2014. We are all feeling his pain. Ashamed and disappointed, Sonic carries on. Sad, alone, and barely able to continue on, Hoshi vows to end it all once and for all. April 30th 2019.

gaming,"Because you saw it *as a child* and have nostalgia for it. Just like in the year 2040 there will be adults who look back fondly on that wacky charming Sonic movie they loved so much.

The 1993 Mario Bros. movie is just as ridiculous and unfaithful to the tone/characters/plot/spirit of the Mario games as this trailer appears to be to the Sonic franchise. If someone wants to make the argument that they still really like it as a stand-alone film just based on its own merits and humor and not as an adaptation, sure, ok. 

But then the same could obviously be true of the Sonic film... except we've all already decided the Sonic film is absolute garbage (without having seen it) *because* it's just a bad adaptation."
gaming,Reminds me of the Car Fox ... fox.

gaming,"Very true, as an old sonic fan way back in the day. I haven't paid much attention to the movie because to me sonic died years ago."
gaming,Sega should have asked a Japanese btram to do this movie at least. This is going to be so horrible.
gaming,Does that mean all Sonic fans are Star Wars fans too? Because the parallels are stunning.

It's so much work to get a pc game the way you want sometimes but when you get it the way you want it the games transcend and become whole new works of art. It's not even as complex as what I described above, giving an old game a new graphic update or messing with the controls to fit your needs, sometimes it's more fun than playing the game."
gaming,Because that's literally the only thing I said right?
gaming,"I played this a solid 5 hours before realizing I had been playing for 5 hours, that's the sign of a good game.... it's fun so far. no regrets. After BFV got just shat on, I picked it up to just see what it's about, it's seriously the best BF game in a long time, so I'm not taking the word of these folks anymore, I'm the only one who knows what I'll like."

gaming,Best render I've seen yet. Almost made me cry.
gaming,"Lol.. Overwatch, R6, and pubg are not relevant at all in any sense. Fortnite is the only one I'd consider competition, but be real. That games competitive environment is only viable as long as the game is popular in pop culture. 

Dota has copied the shit out of league in gameplay. They drastically changed how dota was played for a decade. The entire map was sliced up to copy leagues which promotes constant team fighting. The talent selection is just the most obvious. 

Never said valve didn't want dota popular, but its asinine to think they handled their lead properly at all. League ran train on dota. 

Zero advertising from valve, riot ran a LoL&gt; dota campaign for years, and a Lol creator literally shutdown the biggest NA DOTA forum to promote league, Valves only contributions to the competition scene was TI and that novelty died years ago.

They should have done what riot did, but they didn't. They do the absolute minimum.

Valve is a shit video game Dev company. Their only success post HL1 has been HL2, portal series, and Steam. Their most popular multiplayer games never came from them and every iteration of CS got worse. TF2 was literally just a graphic update.

Dota 2 was a success because ice frog had complete control over balance. The engine itself was shit, but dota was so good it was overlooked.  

Everything Valve does is what they always do. Pluck the best IP mods and put it over their shit engine. 

The only reason CSGO wasn't another failure like CSS is because no.matter what 1.6 was never going to compete bc of graphics. 

Valve is EXTREMELY overrated as a multiplayer gaming Dev. I'll give them credit on single player like HL and Portal, but every venture into MP has been God awful and only successful because of how big the original mods were. We're talking about CS and DotA.

But it's whatever. I was in the cs and dota pro scenes for decade(s). All I hear from ex and current friends in the scene is how shit cs and dota have become the past years.  And from my understanding of league it's the same thoughts, except riot handles the competitive scene 100x better. Meanwhile, valve allows a system where Jackie cuts players before a championship LMAO"

Then proceeded to immediately not pay attention to it anymore.  Last I checked Sonic was a werewolf or something now?  Idk... I just liked the stupid chao garden.  They could have made the entire game focused on that and I would have been fine."

That and they smashed our nostalgic image of Sonic with Amy's hammer. (Does she has an hammer, i think shes craycray enough to swing a giant hammer around)."

gaming,That basically sums up modern Hollywood.
gaming,"Do kids actually care about Sonic? After Sega went years releasing terrible Sonic games, no new gamers became interested in them.

The scary thing is that the marketing people know this. The trailer has the tagline, ""every hero has a genesis,"" because that's really the last positive association people have with the character. They aimed the tagline at people who played the Genesis games.

Honestly, I don't understand how this movie got the green light. By the nature of Sonic, it has to be aimed at a child demographic, but by the nature of the lack of recent success of the property, the only people who this would have high name recognition with are outside that demographic. Maybe they're hoping those people will take their kids to see it and so create a franchise with this thing, but that's a fundamental lack of understanding of parent/child dynamics. In general, parents really don't have much success shaping their kids' tastes in media, that shit is done by advertising directly to kids and cemented through the school friend network. Kids drag their parents to see crappy movies they've been tricked by marketing into wanting to see, not the other way around."
gaming,Sweet pink eye distribution center.

gaming,"SEGA had nothing to do with the movie, IIRC they actually disliked the design."
gaming,"I don't understand why they didn't go full CGI. Characters environment everything. You can get away with so much more if it's CGI rather than constricting yourself to this. 

Then again it's Paramount, they haven't made a good film in years."
gaming,I’m guessing you were about to slap them around with a giant sack of FREEDOM.
gaming,"I don't get this.

They already _called him an alien in the trailer._

Why'd they have to anthropomorphize him? Just literally make IRL Sonic and write it off as alien physiology. Even science consultants will tell you as a filmmaker that that's _perfectly fine_ because the rules of evolution are rarely ever convergent at a macro level.

Give him one big-ole eye with two irises. Give him skinny limbs and a tiny core. Make his head colossally huge. You're already making power-ring wormholes I really don't think that you need to make the damned hedgehog look like a mutated hobbit.

---

And you know what? ~~Sonic~~ Sanic is all CGI. Paramount, please for the love of your own producers and filmmakers, spend a few dozen million extra dollars and just fix it. Just fixing Sonic alone will probably make the film graze 50% on Rotten Tomatoes rather than get the 5% it'll get now."

gaming,i just want to color sonic's arms the correct color and bear-mace a gamestop employee
gaming,I think the few people who do don't want to call him out as that guy who threw Sonic temper tantrums online. Usually people will say they recognize him as that YouTuber and that probably embarrasses him. You can tell he's trying to distance himself from it but I don't think he's changed enough to warrant it.

Even companies like logitech are offering plain box new items for less because of packaging, and blister + print is less than a CD/DVD. Sure its only a few buck, that's all I'm saying, kick down some savings even if a buck. 

DL, addons, patching is normal, and their cost to keep multiplayer and sales going, usually part of a sub too. 

It really baffles me how people defend getting shafted all the time and suck ass for Corperate greed.  They cut the middleman and kept the profits."

gaming,Ok so my theory is that Sonic is a self aware movie meaning that after the feedback they got from when the first picture came out. They decided after that to just go full camp on it and make it just as funny as they wanted. So realistically I see this movie being what they intended it to be and honestly either way I think it’ll be hilarious and rather enjoyable.

gaming,Oh? That will be one of the longest waits on a sequel ever
gaming,"More like pre-release ""in game"" trailer vs release date actual game."
gaming,"Welp, I’m 30 and I played Sonic on the Genesis when I was in grade school and it worked for me so I don’t know what to tell ya kiddo."
gaming,That's also not my problem. Frankly I havent any clue why you would make it yours.
gaming,Didn't play WD but The Division 2's open world is pretty cool.
gaming,Was that the one where you had the little side game with the creatures in the eggs you could train? If that’s the one then I had it for the GameCube and I fucking loved it. It’s still on my steam wishlist and I’ve almost bought it like 15 times.
gaming,Did you say knuckles?
gaming,"As far as the withholding of information, I'm pretty sure both? Can't quite recall, but I'm pretty sure that Geralt could end up pissed at her in Witcher 2 due to finding out.
Though in 2 she *definitely* bangs Geralt while he's afflicted with amnesia and can't remember his lover, so that's screwed up regardless of how you spin it."
gaming,"It was such an unusual design compared to other Sonic games that I feel some of the people who did play it didn't really get it. Unlike past Sonic games that were all about finding the optimal path and sprinting through, this was the first one that rewarded fully exploring levels."
gaming,And the shit memes begin to rise... This movie is already doing so much harm
gaming,Idk if it’s because I’m slightly young but when I was a kid the McDonald’s in my town had a GameCube Kiosk instead of a 64

gaming,Looks better than Sonic.

gaming,"EA
Bethesda
Treyarch
EA
Ubisoft"
gaming,"Dragons dogma if you want something more action orientated, outward if you want to avoid combat and do the side stuff. 

Dragons dogma plays like if Skyrim and a hack and slash had a baby and it got raised by devil may cry. Also the dragon battles are one of the most amazing things in gaming, I've beeten the game three times and I still feel like it's a life or death struggle each and every time.

Outward plays a lot more like a survival game grew up and wanted to be something more. There is a lot of character management, crafting, resource gathering, homestead management and such. Combat always feels like it's something you shouldn't be doing, the mechanics are there and it is a deep system ment to be used but the game stresses realism and how your character could die. It feels very real like as if you yourself were facing this bandit with just a quarter staff. Wounds are a pain to heal and surving the battle isn't enough since you can still bleed out even if you win. I'm more scared of fighting in outward than I am in dark souls while carrying a billion souls"
gaming,I'm not sure if you're being serious or...
gaming,I blame Sonic Mania.   It gave us hope that something good could be done with Sonic... We had hope... and the only thing Despair needs is hope to crush.
gaming,Are you saying enemies shouldn’t be different levels in different areas?
gaming,That and Joe Cartoon
gaming,This sonic look is so fucking disgusting
gaming,Please do not compare greatness incarnate that is Jim Carrey to that annoying lowlife.

gaming,Lol. This was insane. Lol!!!
gaming,I dont remeber cradle of filth having a song named sonic force
gaming,"Sonic Adventure 2 is pretty bad outside of the Sonic and Shadow stages. The hide n seak stages got worse and the tails/eggman stages go **REEEEEEEEE**, literally, when you're locking on to enemies. Bad level designs, bad camera, a bad story, and to top it all off... The sexual tension between Knuckles and Rouge is disturbing.

I didn't play SA 1 on the dreamcast, I'm not some old purist as I don't care if sonic's eyes are green, but SA2 is at best a decent attempt at making a sequel to SA 1.

When it's good, it's only good. When it's bad... It's down right terrible. It's about on par with Forces (which is bad for similar and different reasons)."
gaming,"I know I'm never going to get this, but until the day I die I will wish for a serious Sonic Adventure platformer with the story of the Archie comics/SATAM show."
gaming,"The teeth... the hands and *fingernails.*

I still can’t figure out how someone looked at this and thought, “yep, this design is good and should be in a movie.”"

gaming,"Jumanji, welcome to the jungle"
gaming,"Don't go back and replay it.  The first level is brilliant but... well Sonic Adventures were made at the time that was right for them, and the Gaming world left them behind quickly. 

Sonic Mania is the shit though, definitely play that one."
gaming,Are movie studios still doing that thing where they try to chase a rival movie to the box office with something very similar?  I’m talking about deep impact/Armageddon or deep blue sea/lake placid.  If so this looks like nothing more than a really hasty chase on the detective pikachu movie.
gaming,All of them because they’re never happy
gaming,"Even with the fixed eyes, the furry face instead of skin is just weird"
gaming,Technically I think there are only like 3. Most games that would be Ao don't go through the esrb and are sold through online stores and special events.
gaming,This shot is more intriguing then everything I saw in the trailer.
gaming,It was a little but I prefer it to the over corrected stuff we are getting now where ps4 games are censored
gaming,"You're taking the phrase out of context. All these characteristics could belong to an human, specially on a fantasy setting like Dragon Ball. He does not stand out like a ""slightly different human"" at all. No more than Tenshin Han, or Krillin."
gaming,"I think they length is perfect for it though.  Any longer and they would have to come up with new pieces or over tax themselves.  It's the perfect length to replay multiple times if you want, especially as different characters."
gaming,"Haven't touched a current gen since they came out.

All of the good games are on PC too, and in most cases in a superior shape, so there's no reason to downgrade. Last generation had a pretty good reason, good exclusives. Not sure why the ShitBox still has none, while the ShitPiss finally got one last year, but it does raise a question what's the plan for the next generation. One thing's for sure, higher subscription fees."

gaming,Real Lego is 3+ if I'm not mistaken so I don't see a problem here.
gaming,Critics know nothing. Mario Bros is the GOAT.
gaming,Dont care. Not like I'd see a sonic movie if he looked cool or not.
gaming,AAAAAGAAAATHAAAA- oh wrong game.
gaming,Sega needs to go ahead and sell this IP to Nintendo. I'm tired of this.
gaming,Thats not even remotely accurate. The truth is often mundane and obvious.
gaming,I would still play that. Are servers still online? Loved that game.
gaming,"Ace is the opposite of oblivious. He’s clearly extremely smart and self aware, he’s just very eccentric."
gaming,"Thank you, this is why I think the movie looks bad.  Not because Sonic looks kinda weird or whatever BS everyone's making up when they haven't seen the movie yet.  It looks like a typical cartoon-turned live action movie like Alvin and the Chipmunks or Woody Woodpecker."
gaming,Dude oath! I play every day and still love it. Sure it gets frustrating sometimes but if you don't take it too seriously it's still heaps of fun
gaming,"Funny thing is, this is a repost."
gaming,And he or she will go back home and play league of legends
gaming,Big ass handlebar mustache!
gaming,"The Alien and Predator franchises kind of have to do that because those movies would have no dialogue without human leads. 

I mean technically Predators can talk but I suspect that making them carry a whole script would be disastrous."
gaming,Hours and hours of high quality entertainment
gaming,But that movie is campy awesomeness!
gaming,And it looks like he's doing spectacular.
gaming,"I agree with this guy. Depending on what you're playing, a good mouse can make all the difference in the world."
gaming,It should be but it’s not so that is why I wanna see who will choose the side of PlayStation (the right side in my opinion) or the side of any other console (lamers) 😁

gaming,"Funny how you assume I should educate you. If you really wanna know, ask. Here's a hint: his name is Super\*\*man\*\*."
gaming,"I personally enjoyed the super Mario brothers movie. While the plot was meh, the visual design and creativity adapting the series to some dark world was enjoyable. A very good movie to watch when you’re in a “I don’t give a fuck” mood, especially since all the actors were also in that mood during filming. Good shit. 

The sonic movie? I think the main appeal is going to be the cast. Which. In this case, Jim Carrey. He’s the only reason I’m going to see it, hopefully he can fully save it. Otherwise, by the plot so far, seems like another “I don’t give a shit” kind of plot."
gaming,"holy shit, forgot about this, lol"
gaming,GLHF? Gilf lonely horny fuck?

gaming,Minecraft movie supposed to come out in 2022 I think
gaming,"When will you learn, that your actions have consequences? - squeaky sonic kid"
gaming,"awesome video! yeah, i was wondering why they were defending the uncanny sonic look, implying that making it like 'who framed roger rabbit' would have been a bad thing. their last line 'it has to look like sonic is there, and not just a crossover between cartoon reality and real reality.' like... why? sonic is clearly an impossibly designed cartoon. his pupils share a single eye for god sake. literally making him a hand drawn animated cartoon in the real world would have been better than making him look like an alien child in fuzzy pajamas."
gaming,"Most reviews these days are full of pandering and protest culture. I avoid reviews like I avoid virtue signallers and all the ""ists"""
gaming,"If you ask me, he looks like the Honeycomb cereal monster thing"
gaming,"I agree with your sentiment, and I only partially enjoyed it."
gaming,Build a Bear gone wrong
gaming,My favourite is John Johnson
gaming,Just like the Star Wars Holiday Special
gaming,"The eyes aren't even that bad. They're different from Sonic but not necessarily bad on their own. Definitely worse than most animated movies though.

Its the body shape and the fucking **T E E T H** that make this aberration so horrible."
gaming,"But there have been several movies with all black casts and there have been several movies with black superhero leads. Why find issue over the super specific combination of an all black cast with a black hero lead? It's definitely fine you want that specific combination, but it's hardly reason enough to pretend black heroes and all-black casts don't exist.  Seems a bit like missing the forest for the trees."

gaming,"Dragon's Dogma is awesome, currently replaying it on the switch"
gaming,"*snorts some crack*

Aww shit  man, let's make the hedgehog with a gun black."
gaming,"I only found a plot synapses and it made me physically hurt it was so depressing. Not like I cut myself, I was so deep in misery I ached. To be fair it included the first game (not a lot of people know that Lisa the painful is the second Lisa game. First one is free) and cut out almost all of the humor that is in the game. 

But dude, I watched violence jack and was bored. That is supposed to be the most fucked up anime ever. Lisa is what got to me."
gaming,"Wow. That's on my list for next year so I will keep that in mind. 

Did you find any N64s?"
gaming,The monkey kid wasn’t blue!
gaming,And 100% reason to remember the game
gaming,"so, are those giant spikes supposed to be skin covered with fur or what?  in the sprite, they had to make it look like a saw because, you know, sprite graphics."
gaming,"Definitely one of the worst sonic titles i've ever had the misfortune to play. 

The game constantly breaks your flow every few seconds and its probably the first game to start the trend of having enemies that literally server no purpose. The engine is extremely buggy too . . .

I'm so glad I made the decision to buy Ninja Gaiden instead. I specifically made a trip to the store to buy heroes, but walmart had Ninja Gaiden on demo and it won me over. Playing Sonic Heroes years later really showed me just how much of a bullet I dodged."
gaming,I believe the term is lotus eater machine
gaming,"”Why me?”
- Sonic"
gaming,"Yes it was good. Mostly because it was 2/3rds levels from past games, with new bosses, a few things mixed around, and every type of shield from all the classic games."
gaming,Where'd you get that OG Switch from? It's gotta be a collectors item by now :O
gaming,Ignorance really is bliss huh
gaming,"No, she's hoping they don't get _killed_. Duh."
gaming,All of them except Cdprojektred and Rockstar. Though a few hate rockstar as well.
gaming,Garden warfare 1 and 2 are solid games.
gaming,"I guess it depends on what you're playing mostly.

Tho a good and comfortable mouse is always a must have."
gaming,"I used to raise chao as if it was a video game career. I remember at some point I was breeding them so much I got chaos that didn’t even make sense, like transparent ones."

Ah, yes- a small indie film. Here's hoping it can break into the top ten at the box office- it sure is an underdog!"

gaming,When will you learn?
gaming,I liked the Game Boy Advance Sonic games more. Felt more fresh. Mania was all recycled concepts.
gaming,"Colors was shit and Generations was only slightly less shit. The only good thing to come from Generations was the soundtrack and the only good thing from colors was . . .well . . .nothing other than the garbage ass ""boost"" gameplay."
gaming,"It's ""Ass 2"".  It's just an hour and a half of an ass doing nothing, but this time, it's furry."
gaming,"Bradley Pierce was in Jumanji with Patricia Clarkson who was also in The Safety of Objects with Timothy Olyphant who worked alongside Ben Schwartz in This Is Where I Leave you, giving Bradley Pierce a Ben Schwartz number of 3."
gaming,"&gt; 1993 Mario Bros. movie is just as ridiculous and unfaithful to the tone/characters/plot/spirit of the Mario games as this trailer appears to be to the Sonic franchise.

Ok but Super Mario Bros. is *entertainingly* bad.

This shit has about as much entertainment value as a train wreck. That you're in."
gaming,"Seeing then torn up, broken and disgusting shit on them made me realize the fall of humanity was upon us."
gaming,Dude the ending of the painful gave me depression and it's sadder each time I beat it. Austin Jorgensen is amazing.
gaming,"Honestly, he is the only reason I am going to watch this movie. He can't save it, but he can make it entertaining."
gaming,"Anyone who is a self-described ""veteran sonic fan"" deserves disappointment"
gaming,"&gt;the day time of sonic unleashed are also good.

That's the ""same shit"" part I was talking about, though. The 2D parts of Sonic Generations were the stand-out bits, as far as I'm concerned, but the uncomfortable angles, speed, and hazards of the modern Sonic parts and, overall, modern Sonic games, are the parts that have put me off playing any Sonic games after Shadow the Hedgehog."
gaming,"Let me just push the joystick up a little bit and oh, I fell off the stage."
gaming,"I like 1995 Mortal Kombat, as shitty as it may seem"
gaming,How much did you pay for your Saturn?
gaming,"All I can hear-

AaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaAaaaAaaaaaaaz"
gaming,Wow he looks horrible
gaming,Sonic Adventures 2 for Gamecube was the last sonic game i enjoyed. The Chao garden was surprisingly addictive.
gaming,"When all they've been told is a lie, however, the truth will seem like heresy."
gaming,"I personally have never been a big fan of Sonic, but changing the design of an iconic character is a recipe for trouble."
gaming,This movie is going to be to furries what *The Wizard of Oz* is to the gay community...god help us.
gaming,Is there a way to get a copy of any of the old dune games? My first PC game ever was dune 2000.
gaming,"I am genuinely so surprised that Total War: Game of Thrones hasn’t been made yet. If there were ever a TV show and a game franchise that were made for each other, it would be those two."
gaming,Looks like a furry fell into a vat of acid lol
gaming,"Nope, I am 100% in agreement. He won't rescue the film, hell, he won't even be good, but he will be entertaining and that is all I care about."
gaming,"""you little fucking hedgehog just wait till i get my hands on your IP and develop you into a horrible new game as an even uglier little shit I HATE SONIC!"""
gaming,More like people who work on movie should know the source material.
gaming,"You and everyone else above the age of 12 probably.  I have the special edition of that animated movie, the guy who did the voice acting for Starscream and Cobra Commander in GI Joe is a national treasure."
gaming,"At the end of the Detective Pikachu movie there is a end credit scene where Pikachu goes the ludicolo bar and Masahiro Sakurai approaches him buys Pikachu a drink. Pickachu says ""Who the hell are you"" Sakurai responds with ""I'm here to talk to you about the smash initiative.""
At the end of the Sonic movie there is a end credit scene where Mario and Pikachu appears from the dark and there is a stare down between the 3 icons l until Pikachu says ""I don't mean to ruin the moment, but what are we gonna do about that"" as a the screen pans to a master hand descending down from the skies. Cut to black. 'Mario, Sonic, and Pikachu will return in Super Smash Brothers'"

gaming,idk I liked the anime...
gaming,"Still not quite sure why a Sonic movie is being made? Call me old, but having played Sonic the Hedgehog games since the early 90s, I’m going out on a limb and saying that this is an intentionally bad movie. 
Who knows really. It will probably make double its investment, and we will get a Sonic trilogy."
gaming,"The Devs of Witcher series, the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 and owners of GoG."
gaming,What? Nahhhhhh guess then the artists would have had to of been somewhat competent and knowledgeable about Sonic.
gaming,It's a really awesome place to get lost in but the first day is overwhelming and can be quite claustrophobic. Nah I didnt see any n64s there isnt a McDonalds in the medina but there is one in the new city we didnt go there though so maybe they might have some.
gaming,"There is a fan game called the Lisa the pointless that there are people begging to be made cannon. It's difficult from last I heard but it's got the humor, and while set in the same depressing world the characters are actually hopeful. They are trying to find a better life in the shit hole that lisa's world now is, even if it might be pointless."
gaming,"Yes, that's the actual, horrifying, movie version.  You're totally right about it looking like bad taxidermy; that's a perfect description."
gaming,Am I having a stroke
gaming,"Seriously, how are there people that don't know this?"
gaming,The one by my school still has them
gaming,"This movie looks like a cross between Road Runner and Twister, where exactly is the Sonic in this? Don't point at that two-eyed freak either!"
gaming,"I mean, there is no way it can be worse than the super mario brothers movie, right? RIGHT??"
gaming,"Yeaaaaah, but the product they're selling... didn't. Rise of Lyric is a notoriously bad and broken game. It's been compared unfavorably with '06.

Of course, I suppose there's something to be said for making Rise of Lyric look good."
gaming,"It drew from the Super Mario Bros Super Show, as well as taking many of its own liberties. Many people forget that an odd live-action Mario existed before the film."
gaming,"All I want from this movie is to have a chase scene down the streets of San Francisco with the song ""Escape from the City"" from Sonic Adventure 2...please let that happen!"
gaming,\&gt; implying there's *new* Sonic fans
gaming,That went through an approval process...
gaming,"Isn’t it doctor robotnick and sonic just calls him egghead or eggman?  So it wouldn’t be Dr eggman, just eggman."

gaming,"Wait, that’s how you masturbate too?"
gaming,I'm sorry they both belong in whoville.
gaming,And then there's Pokemon Detective Pikachu.
gaming,Would you want a decaying corpse in your movie?
gaming,"He said to himself, as he goes through the Pokémon center dialog one more time"
gaming,"His teeth and his eyes make me fucking cringe, they're so wrong. And he's awkwardly lanky. What did they do to this poor guy :("
gaming,Final fantasy wasn't a video game movie.
gaming,Doom. Greatest movie ever.
gaming,I've met some hot woman that play league.  I was sort of mad I knew nothing about it.. not that I'd really actually talk to them about it.
gaming,But why? Why would you do that?
gaming,The handheld Sonic games were pretty good. Sonic Advance 3 will always be my favorite GBA title.
gaming,It’s a switch pro controller
gaming,"Sonic Mania was good, but I think Sega may have just been the publisher on that one (not certain, though)."
gaming,I have no idea what the hell the designer of this Sonic was thinking. It looks like someone in a mascot suit.
gaming,"They had a teaser trailer thing awhile back, but nothing came of it. If done right it could be a great film, or it can be a complete dumpster fire."
gaming,They could have literally dropped GameCube animated Sonic from 2003 Rodger Rabbit style and it would have looked better than this.
gaming,"The Mario Bros. Movie is still a classic to bring out on bad movie night. Its such a weird touchstone of late 80s/early 90s culture and it just so damn bizarre when compared with the games that it still is watchable due to its sheer ""what the fuck are we watching"" quality. Pure MST3K level stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow I don't think the sonic movie will be quite like that, but we'll see."
gaming,Trailer wasn't that bad tbh.
gaming,Why would any company want a nazi at an anniversary?
gaming,This movie will be such a good bad movie to watch I'm stoked
gaming,"For one moment. 

Imagine. 

Amazing 3D CGI representations that are extremely faithful to these designs, in a fully animated movie, with a cool spin and references to all the original games. 

But. We got... yeaaah..."
gaming,Because you touch yourself at night.
gaming,Redoing all the CGI? Holy shit they might as well just burn a pile of cash like the Joker.

gaming,I hope Mega 64 does another Sonics video.
gaming,"I'm excited for the film, my kid will love it too she loves sonic"

gaming,Coming from a person who drives a Chevy Cobalt...
gaming,If you liked it I highly recommend his other stuff. It’s all really engaging and the production quality is off the charts. And yeah honestly I wouldn’t mind a more cartoonish looking sonic. I mean Sonic of all video game mascots is probably the hardest one to pull off live action I feel like they should’ve done like a focus group on his design or something before putting all their money and resources into making this version.

gaming,"LEGO city undercover is, in my opinion the best LEGO to date. Bullshit hard to complete and the free roam is amazing."
gaming,That’s what I came here to argue
gaming,"You can, I used it a little bit before giving up and doing it normally. The problem is this:

In the original game, Crash's hitbox was a rectangle, meaning the bottom of it was flat and was therefore easy to stay on the rope once you get on it. The N.Sane trilogy hitbox was changed however. It is a pill shape, meaning the bottom isn't flat at all, so once you get on the rope, it is very difficult to stay on it, especially with the analog stick (the original was just d-pad, no diagonal movement)."
gaming,Get this to the goddamn top.
gaming,"The first one was ok-ish.  It had a lot of faults, but it was still a fun giant robot ass-kick-a-thon.

Funny enough though, I think the 3rd was my favorite.  Incredibly flawed, but it had more plot than the rest.  The whole space bridge thing was great, but the movie was so broken and incomplete it made me wonder if there was 20 minutes cut from it."
gaming,"My work let me take a hololens home so I made a test video a while back.

https://youtu.be/myMvRnFZHN8

This shows the occlusion a bit with the window in the living room."
gaming,"Olay, I was a Sega kid and I played all the Sonic games. With that said, I have absolutely no nostalgia for character of Sonic. It’s not like he ever had any character at all. Mario had 10 times the amount of charisma even when comparing the older games to each other. So why the hell would they think anyone my age would give a shit. And why the hell would Gangster’s Paradise have any pull on me? It’s not like that song aged with me either."
gaming,where can I buy this holy shit
gaming,Cindy Lou Who and the Grinch's deformed love child... Even his teeth are ghastly
gaming,I'm pretty sure at least 4 of my 7 shirts are twice as old as anything in that dope collection. I think I'm t-shirting wrong. Oh yeah....money.
gaming,"I'm with you. It started as a ""so-bad-its-good"" movie, but I've come to unironically like it."
gaming,"That's not what I find confusing. 

sonic and knuckles is the last sonic game that was publicly consumed. Further games never made much of a cultural impact, so in a certian sense the franchise ended there, k?


so that was 1994

in film that year the lion king came out, it's understandable that being revisited, it's been an active cultural concern this entire time.

I don't see Hollywood reexploring city slickers two:the quest for curlies gold."
gaming,This is nothing new for veteran Sonic fans tho!
gaming,So solid. Great games
gaming,"I feel like this Sonic the Hedgehog would look a lot less weird if they got rid of those ridiculous sideburns, made his face look less human and made his snout protrude more, and replace his human teeth with hedgehog/animal teeth.

&amp;#x200B;

They could've also not made this at all and just called it quits, but it's all good."
gaming,that thing isn't creepy? If you saw that coming at you would welcome it with open arms or punt it?
gaming,Because they were *really* into speedwalking.
gaming,"Here, take some karma. Hope it helps."
gaming,And they messed with song from the cartoon. Who the hell thinks they could make that song any better than it was - it was perfection.

gaming,Is this for real?

gaming,Hatsune Miku made minecraft idk what youre talking about
gaming,Mortal Kombat is awesome.
gaming,I saw Holmes and Watson for that reason but didn't feel the hate was justified.
gaming,Sonic games were always garbage. Go back and play them. They weren't as good as you remember.
gaming,I think I saw it in perhaps PC gamer magazines. Maybe I saw a display of it all the time at big electronics stores.
gaming,"Plenty of my childhood favorites don't hold up. SMB is still fun to revisit. And it's hard to call something a bad adaptation of a series that had, what, like twenty pages of plot development across several games at the time?"
gaming,That was my exact first thought when I first saw the trailer!
gaming,"You convinced me to get a better chair. I know this is late, but I wanted to say that I went through my journey and finally found a good one. That other chair really was painful, and now it’s much better. Thanks!"
gaming,How could there possibly even be new sonic fans
gaming,Hopefully if they put Shadow in they don’t give him a fucking gun this time
gaming,Why is it hilarious if they don't know what it is?
gaming,"Welllll, I pray that you get the strength to beat the bonus level, Stormy Ascent. It is seen by many who have played the game as even harder than the bridge levels. Oh and if you're going for 100%ing the game, you have to do the bridge level without a mistake to get the golden ankh thing."
gaming,Rest in peace little gamer...Condolences
gaming,"He supposed to be a man, but better. If you make him not a man, you're missing the point of the character. The fact that he's actually a kriptonian and not human is meaningless, the point is that he looks like a man, and has the same values of a man, but better. You have never read a page of a Superman comic. You don't get the character."
gaming,I'm afraid that I'm going to compare it to The Last Of Us too much and be disappointed!
gaming,Oh ya my bad 😓

gaming,My soul being crushed
gaming,"I would say don't worry, but lest we forget The Emoji Movie made over $217 Million on a $50 Million budget.  Despite how many of us think this movie is going to suck ass, there will still be an onslaught of thirty something moms taking their little ones to see it because it'll be deemed the ""can't miss"" film this Fall."
gaming,I know I know.  But if they did that I feel like it would still net more profit.  No one is going to set this movie.
gaming,Running fast does not mean lightning reflexes.
gaming,"It's that bad, nostalgia or not this ""sonic"" looks aweful."
gaming,The movie is ballad of buster scruggs
gaming,Never played those or knew they existed.
gaming,Jaleel White \*\*IS\*\* Sonic The Hedgehog.
gaming,"Shit, my secret is out"
gaming,"I played it at a friends when it first came out. It’s a cool concept, but Mortal Kombat 11 is out now and he and I are playing MK11 like crazy."
gaming,"Ryan Reynolds, maybe? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
gaming,Is this dunkeys car?
gaming,Still have fully functional ones near where I live. Still play on them sometimes.
gaming,"i got it today- 6 hours in. i’ve never been *so bad* at any video game

it’s fun, but the controls are complicated if you’re not used to this style of combat, &amp; playing with friends is next to impossible right now. 

xo &amp; gold is bugged, but the devs have promised compensation to players for it.

not sure if i’m going to keep it or not yet."

gaming,"Austin Jorgensen said that he considers all fan games canon lol, LISA The Hopeful is really good too. Only chapter 1 of Pointless is out but it's getting a big update to make it stand up to the quality of the future chapters 2 and 3."
gaming,Can I get another 1000 reposts of this? And make it go to the front page every time anyway.
gaming,That game is cancer though. He should stop playing.
gaming,And your point is? All I said was he could slightly but noticeably different. You're just being a jackass perfectionist. Also his organs are different in the comics. Fuck off
gaming,Whats the bet those controllers were dirtier than a remote control in a hotel.
gaming,"You've just taken your first step into a larger universe, Mr. Hedgehog."
gaming,"Interesting. It definitely still has a long way to go, but that's quite a bit better than I expected. Thanks for the video. It can be hard to gauge these things from promotional videos because they're geared so specifically towards hiding flaws and playing up strengths (which is understandable, because they're trying to sell the thing). That tech has enormous potential and I can't wait to see where it's going next."
gaming,Hey you edited that
gaming,"One of the many things that bug me on the list was the fact that in the trailer, he instantly goes into a ball in that one  clip. If they wanted to go for all this realism they could have at least had him tuck and roll and then take off in a blurry as soon as he hit the ground. Nope. He just instantly goes ball as soon as he face plants into the road."

gaming,"I mean I don't see anything particularly wrong with Pikachu in the live action movie, tbh it'd be weirder if he had smooth yellow skin and not fur, you know? It doesn't veer too drastically from the original design whereas this... Abomination.... It's not Sonic..."
gaming,"Interesting. I think this piece never came out in Germany or I just did not saw it, because I wasn't a pc gamer back then. Its an interesting device. Imagine you had it back then and your friends would blown away. :D"
gaming,Chemical Plant Zone was my jam.
gaming,I liked the Mario movie...I guess I mustve beem a dumb kid.
gaming,A local dentist office has one of these in their lobby. Looks just like this! I totally didnt play Mario Kart when I was suppose to be installing hardware.

gaming,"The quote originally, if you look at the text before it, is a deluge discussing why the ‘civilized races’ are therefore superior on account of their keeping of records.

“...when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.”

Those who do not know the past of the quote are doomed to repeat it.

gaming,"“His newfound best friend...”

Tails: Am I a joke to you?"
gaming,"Of course, but I'm saying it's a mistake, because it is. No, current sonic is a flop (comparatively speaking, on it's own it did meh) so there just isnt a child audience large enough to warrant a target audience. 

As for the character design, it's not just cause its jarring, its legitimately just bad.

Wheres that meme of the why are you mad I'm right guy? For those of you who downvoted me."

gaming,LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC LIKE SONIC AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
gaming,"Might get a bit of backlash for this one but I found to the be a bit of a ‘meh’ battlefield compared to other titles. It’s a good experience, it looks stunning and I’m pretty sure most stuff is balanced now but I don’t think it is one of the best recent ones. 

Bad Company 2, B3/4 all have more compelling infantry, tank and aerial gameplay while not being as graphically immersive (albeit still good looking). Tbh if V had more content and wasn’t so buggy then it would probably beat 1 too. What it provides is definitely worth the $2 though."
gaming,I’m still wondering if a guy who liked sonic in the early 90s and never played it again could be considered a “sonic fan”. That’d be like being called a rocket power fan nowadays
gaming,THEY HAD N64’s!!!!!?!?!?!? THATS AMAZING
gaming,"Actually, here's something funny. Christian Whitehead, lead developer of Mania, worked on porting up earlier Sonic titles.


That said...yeah, I think if they're pulling from that pool for developers then they may be figuring it out."
gaming,I hope they pull an Aladdin move for this movie.  Initial trailer was below decent but the trailer released after that made me excited.
gaming,he'll consider dota but remember the time he tried and got stomped
gaming,Jack Black's performance as a 16 year-old girl.
gaming,"It looks good, sadly I have this thing about menu combat RPGs... I can't play them. I have two in my top ten games of all time and I have never beat them cus I get bored of the combat and it's needed to continue."

gaming,I mean… have you watched Mario Bros recently? It’s horrendous but in such a satisfying way.
gaming,"Pikachu still looks adorable. This is the stuff of nightmares

Pikachu is basically the same thing but ""realistic"", this is like those weird ""realistic interpretations"" of Pokemon that make them look more like monsters"
gaming,Awww Don’t be so hard on yourself youre not stupid. it’s very plausible for two complete strangers to have the same idea (I’m just going off the timeline in this particular situation) This is Reddit after all!
gaming,There should be a game jam to make every single one of these titles and release it in a compilation.

gaming,There is no war in Ba Sing Se
gaming,"Even if you're not a fan of Westerns, it's a fantastic movie"
gaming,"Not a movie, but Castlevania on Netflix is the best video game adaptation we have. A TV Series, but at least it was made by people passionate about the project."
gaming,Do kids care about sonic. I played it when I was 5. I'm now 30. The film just looks like it's playing very young.
gaming,"Unpopular opinion: I kind of like the Sonic redesign, it's akin to the Detective Pikachu realism aesthetic, albeit a bit too colourful. Too bad the rest of the movie looks like a 90s direct to DVD movie."
gaming,"Unfortunately I never saw the 64s, but I did see the gamecubes."
gaming,"Openra has you covered, brosephine."
gaming,"Nobodys dick is that long, not even long dick Johnson and he had a fucking long dick, thus the name"
gaming,Jesus Christ now that you said that I looked at the real one and I hate myself for it
gaming,"Damn, it looks like that monkey kid from Jumanji."
gaming,"That’s kind of my point: we’re all 100% convinced Sonic is absolute trash because we hate the way it’s being adapted, but none of us have seen the movie. 

SMB takes WILD liberties with tone/characters, but we look past it because, “who cares! It’s fun!” Neither franchise has - let’s be honest here - *any* kind of plot or lore beyond very surface level stuff. Just pointing out that it’s slightly hypocritical. 

And I’m definitely not defending Sonic, I do think the trailer looks really bad. But mostly because it looks like a bad *movie,* not a bad *Sonic adaptation*."
gaming,Maybe I’m just white trash but that soundtrack sounds awesome.
gaming,"Hate how these are unlisted now.

gaming,Dennis is bastard man
gaming,"Sir, the Goombas are dancing again."
gaming,I got ace Ventura vibes from the trailer
gaming,"Yes, he's also weak to kryptonite and can fly. He's not human. But if he has horns or something obviously not human, that beats the point of the character. The point is other people look at him as a goal, a paragon of virtue, something that they can aspire to be. If people can't relate to Superman, then the character is not Superman anymore. If you get offended for getting told you don't know something, then don't speak about stuff you don't know."
gaming,Nice. You even have the brighter backlight.
gaming,"The transformers in the 80s and the animated movie were made to sell toys, they were entirely about making money. If there’s a list of franchises from the 80s that should be immune, transformers would not be on that list. Same with gi joe."
gaming,I think attempting to do anything other than cartoony with a big blue hedgehog that can run at superspeed was a huge mistake.
gaming,That's a cool way to rage quit. When uninstalling just doesn't do it for you.
gaming,you would starve and die
gaming,"I know everyone's freaking out about how gross he looks but the thing I find most offensive is that this is yet another one of those awful ""What if \_\_\_\_ came to THE REAL WORLD???"" plots.

I'm pretty sure it's just what inevitably happens whenever they hand a licensed character to a writer who knows nothing about the existing franchise and cares even less."
gaming,Is this a game or something? I'm totally lost here
gaming,"&gt; Raul Julia

Super Mario Bros the show, and the movie where epic when I was a kid. John Leguizamo as Luigi was amazing."
gaming,Lol why are his hands white? So dumb.
gaming,"Hmm good point, they didn’t change Pikachu’s body shape."
gaming,"64 refers to its 64-bit processor, so could it not be the descriptor? 64 describes which Nintendo it is. IDK I just really want ""Nintendos 64"" to be correct."
gaming,TL;DR: Cheaters get banned.
gaming,What the fuck. How. And more importantly *why*
gaming,When the smurfs go live action... FUCK GO BACK!!!
gaming,"I’ve preferred console since PSOne.  I mostly games on PC back in the early-mid 90’s. The first open GL voodoo graphics cards started to come out around then irc (translucent water! colored lighting!). If you think graphics cards are expensive now, that’s nothing compared to when it was new tech lol. I slowly stopped being able to run games in a playable state.  Xmas ‘98 I got a PlayStation and a copy of Tales of Destiny and never looked back."
gaming,"Well then I hope the second movie is an absolute success and redeems the first movie, have the second movie introduce Tales, and then knuckles will end the trilogy."
gaming,"this really do look like the kid from Jumanji, post monkey."
gaming,"Honestly I don't really care at all about the Sonic thing that's happening, I'm just responding to SMB hate. That movie ruled because it was awesome."
gaming,"&gt;  Mortal Kombat was dope though

It had a dope theme to go with it and just enough cheese to smooth it over til Armageddon."
gaming,It's the ninja turtles eyes all over again...
gaming,He should have brought a real gun then we would not have to sit through this like we had with the emoji movie
gaming,"At the end of the Detective Pikachu movie there is a end credit scene where Pikachu goes the ludicolo bar and Masahiro Sakurai approaches him buys Pikachu a drink. Pickachu says ""Who the hell are you"" Sakurai responds with ""I'm here to talk to you about the smash initiative.""
At the end of the Sonic movie there is a end credit scene where Mario and Pikachu appears from the dark and there is a stare down between the 3 icons l until Pikachu says ""I don't mean to ruin the moment, but what are we gonna do about that"" as a the screen pans to a master hand descending down from the skies. Cut to black. 'Mario, Sonic, and Pikachu will return in Super Smash Brothers'"
gaming,"It was a childhood classic and it was a really bad movie. And really, who are we to deny today’s kids their really bad movies too?

I swear, the only people bitching about this movie are old enough to have jobs. Sonic is for kids! Adults will always hate the things made for kids."
gaming,"Regardless it looks like a movie for kids, as in, a kids movie. With a super cheesy plot, goofy talking animal and wild antics like dodging cartoon rockets. In other words, this movie is as much for you as the secret life of pets 2 is for you."
gaming,"&gt; and owners of GoG

Didn't know that. Interesting."
gaming,They're not cheats dumbass it's a program that detects cheaters.
gaming,God ... Can you just write the action scenes for the movie instead? Taking it from a scientific angle sounds so awesome.
gaming,Can Sonic be ruined?
gaming,TRUE Sonic fans haven't been fans since the GENESIS era.
gaming,I remember this was the absolute shit except the controllers were beat up to shit and half of them were stolen lmao
gaming,"Seriously, it's horrifying.  It's like a teletubby and the live action Cat in a Hat had a baby."
gaming,"Lindsay Ellis opened my eyes to Bay's Transformers. There is more depth to them than the public tends to acknowledge or even notice. I don't like them, primarily because of the editing and cinematography. But I have to agree that there was more heart, and probably more thought, put into the newer movies than the old series."
gaming,Damn really? Love those games!

gaming,"""That was left handed."""
gaming,Actually I came back after fortnites big Ryze. And by God I have found it to me much less toxic. Now idiot drivers in Ottawa on the other hand is just as toxic as the league community two years ago.
gaming,Not to mention the upcoming pikachu movie... except i lowkey wanna see that
gaming,This is exactly what I thought the moment I saw sonic lol. I wish I had been the lucky one to edit this on my own but I’ve been at work all day :/

gaming,Yes. A better comparison would have been Dragon Ball Evolution.

gaming,"Super Mario Brothers wasn't SUPPOSED to be bad.  Tt just devolved into an absolute clusterfuck where they kept rewriting and changing the script so much that some actors literally didn't even bother reading it and would just have people hand them their lines at shooting, and the directors had no earthly idea what the absolute fuck they were doing.

gaming,Nah it’s the guy who wants his face shot in Borderlands

gaming,the sound design in respect to a remix of every stage song based on past/present/future then if it was good/bad future is still one of my favorite things in any game. I know i’m in the minority but the NA soundtrack is so damn good.
gaming,Boofs crack SANIC? IS THAT SOME KIND OF DRUG!?
gaming,This is actually so true wtf

Think about how Bryan Cranston brings up the subject of selling bombs to the American army and the ""totally not propaganda main character"" says some stupid shit is, ""I dont drop bombs, I disarm them"" in a semi-condescending tone, implying disgust at the very idea that the US Army blows shit up for fun (they do).

gaming,But detective pikachu is gonna be rad
gaming,No it isn't. Army of Darkness is over the top funny. Evil Dead was supposed to take it serious.

gaming,I can see the bald cap...that does not bode well.
gaming,"there are non-ventran sonic fans? I feel like sonic fans have just been sonic fans since the genesis days and just never died out or got bored. Im genuinely confused as to how a movie got approved much less made.. where are all these sonic fans.. they couldnt be new people, sonic mania was good but what was worth talking about before that would have drawn in a large enough crowd to justify a fucking movie being made??"
gaming,Thanks! You got it I knew I remembered it right.

gaming,"You watched those videos very differently then I did. I read them as mostly explaining concepts using the transformers movie as a tongue in cheek joke, because most of those concepts were absolutely not choices made by the director, and can be read into with any bad movie.

No, the transformers movies are better then the original cartoons because the cartoons are really fucking bad."
gaming,One is sad and miserable and the other is playing with your penis.
gaming,The remake of the original? Bruce Campbell one
gaming,OK I might be on board for that change. Now I gotta watch the movie.

gaming,"The thing is, all the video games with good storytelling, kind of already are movies to begin with. So either you're making a live action reenactment of Red Dead Redemption, making Red Dead Redemption fan fiction, or you're making Street Fighter: The Movie. Versus a comic book adaptation, which is a lot more like translating a book to a movie."
gaming,"No problem. There are plenty of movies that I really want to see that I don't watch until they come out on video. I don't go to the theater that often, so I save it for great movies."
gaming,"They still can only get 30 fps on open world games and ps4 pro cant even do actual 4k, its checkerboarded to look like 4k"
gaming,Did you miss the final shot of the trailer?
gaming,"I understand people think it's a terrible representation. But wha tI don't get are people who are like 'They did a disservice to their fans!'

This movie isn't for people who grew up with Sonic. It's for kids. It's a kids movie. They are trying to attract the attention of kids.

I'm not saying that they will succeed, but this is /clearly/ not a movie for adults. And TBH I can point to a hell of a lot of really shitty kids movies that kids love."

gaming,Marsden should be good. He can be very charismatic and I think he has just enough comedy chops to make it work. I think he will contrast nicely with Carrey and expect their dichotomy to be entertaining. I think once you get past Sonic being changed to appeal to a wider audience and work in a live action setting (he couldn't be a cartoon no matter how much reddit thinks it looks better) then this movie could be a fun one.

lots of games with a good enough core goal and characters probably have a decent movie in them."

gaming,"I don't know if we watched them differently so much as we came to it with different perspectives. Before watching those, to me Transformers were the worst and had no value. She proved that even if they aren't good, there is something to be read in them and things to learn. In particular, Mikaela Banes' character and the dissonance between how she's written and how she's framed."
gaming,"&gt;Aren't many of these sequels and remakes and things successful though? I thought that they pushed tickets enough to make the investment worthwhile and that's the only reason they were doing it. EDIT: Literally just googled a dozen remakes and all of them profited at box office, so there's definitely a trend.

It depends on what you consider successful.  A movie like The Force Awakens?  Definitely successful.  But the following Star Wars films did less and less, not meeting Disney's expectations.  Did they still make a boat load of money?  Sure.  Even Solo and TLJ made a hefty profit.  But TLJ doing almost half as well as TFA is not something shareholders would consider a success.  That's a downward trend.

And a lot of the other sequels/remakes/reboots in recent years have had the same problem.  Studio makes a Ghostbusters reboot or a sequel to Terminator and it doesn't do as well as expected.  But instead of questioning themselves, if the people they have in charge and the ""daring new direction"" they took was the cause, they just deny it and blame the fans.  Then they go on to repeat the same mistakes with the next reboot/sequel.

&gt;Your argument is that Hollywood thinks they're making valuable changes, but I would argue that they're not making any changes. They're changing source material, yes, but more importantly they're intentionally repeating a successful pattern of remaking old things. I don't think that they find their work particularly valuable, I think they find that it makes them a lot of the green stuff.

But the argument that was being made above is that they're going against the formula that made the original product they're adapting successful.  That itself is a change.  They will take a product like Ghostbusters and remove most of the things people liked about the original film.  Yes, it has the ""formula"" of the original film.  Almost a shot for shot remake of it.  But while the locations and the beats of the script are the same, they change the characters personalities, the type of comedy they employ, the tone of the film and etc.  So it's actually a dramatic change from the original film.  People go in expecting Ghsotbusters full of sarcastic dry humor and certain character traits.  And instead, they get lol random humor (lots of fart jokes) and entirely different characters the total opposite of the original.  This turns off the exact intended market they were trying to appeal to (fans of the original).  

So what's the point in making a Ghostbusters film then?  Should have just made a totally new movie focused on a premise that would work better for the random humor and aimed at a new audience.  Obviously they didn't do this because they spent all the money to buy the Ghostbusters license and try to revive it.  But just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.  Trying to make lightning strike twice hardly ever works (just ask Ghostbusters 2).  And it leads to angering the fans, which has a negative effect that loses more money in the long term than the short term profit you made off one film.

Anyway, long rant aside, I argue most of these reboots and sequels are changing tons of stuff.  And those changes are what the fans hate.

&gt;They can cash-in on nostalgia, and it's not even terribly risky. Even the Marvel stuff is kind of nostalgia cash-in, it's just more successful because it's adapting media that several audiences haven't heard the story for yet.

You can make that argument in part.  But like you said, several people (the vast majority of the audience) aren't fans of the comics.  They didn't get into Marvel until the live action movies started.  And those movies do a lot of new things that aren't in line with the comics.  So in reality, the Marvel films are a perfect example of doing something different.  They created their own formula, something unique that audiences don't associate with another IP like Transformers or Star Wars or The Matrix or Lord of the Rings.  And as a result, it set the trend for the next decade.  This is in contrast to the endless reboots which are trying to copy or appease the fans of the original film, and failing at it.

&gt;I would attribute a lot of positivity from creators to their remake creations as partially genuine, but primarily PR. It's one thing to say ""yeah, we did a great job animating the Lion King!"" and another to say ""this is a valuable contribution to cinema!"" I can't imagine there's actually as much enthusiasm about this from the creators as we're led to believe, but die-hard fans of franchises will eat anything put on their plate.

I definitely get the vibe from a lot of people working on these films that it is more of an obligation and not an art.  Especially when you look deep into the films development and a lot of them are formed by committees of shareholders and producers.  Not a core writing staff.  ""The film needs [x] number of dramatic panning shots to fit in trailers"" or ""The film needs [y] amount of product placement to placate our licensees.""  You know how it goes.  There isn't as much creative freedom as making a totally original film.  So yeah, I totally agree with you there.

But as to your other point about fans of a franchise eating anything given to them, that's already been disproven by the large amount of series which are on a downward trend.  Star Trek, Star Wars, DC universe, Pirates, etc.  All of these franchises have seen later movies get less and less popular.  And it's not because of fatigue or the sequel effect, as Marvel films keep rising even when we're in the 20th one or something.  The downward trend starts when a movie is lackluster or does something to annoy the audience.  And every movie after that one starts to see a dwindling of ticket and BD sales.  So the problem is just that some of these reboots/sequels are bad.  Or at least the audience thinks they are.  And I think Aladdin/The Lion King are going to be the films that start the downward trend for live action Disney remakes.  Heck, some people are already turned off by Dumbo."

gaming,"I'm mainly an old school 2D Sonic fan but there are a few great Sonic games past SA2. Colors, Generations, and Mania were excellent through and through. I hear Heroes and Lost World are both good but I've never played either. The first two GBA games are also worth playing as well for sure. The rest are bad to abysmal as far as I have dabbled myself and seen elsewhere. 

Coming back completely around to your statement again I adored the two Adventure games when they came out but now after replaying them more than a few times since they are pretty wonky and don't hold up that well. I still like them and they both have good and great elements respectively but I don't think they deserve as much praise as they seem to keep getting."

I mean, I’m not in the movie biz so I could be wrong, but seems like you would hardly need to reshoot anything and could just swap it.  At this point it seems like it might be worth it because of how bad the feedback is."

Honestly there's really no successful formula for Sonic right now so they really should shake things up in a big way. Not just a ""He's a werewolf now but all the platforming is the same"" kind of way though"

gaming,"apparently it's called, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" which is an anthology of 6 short films that take place after the Civil War"
gaming,*picture of Benjamin Franklin*
gaming,For the time you tried playing it lately tho?
gaming,"I couldn't finish it because the Liam Neeson one was just repeating itself for 15 minutes and it was miserable, but the James Franco one really stuck with me for some reason. I don't know if the guy just lost the will to live after cheating death so many times, or if he was only capable of living purely in the moment, I don't know, but I like thinking about his death scene a lot and I wish I knew more."
gaming,You got a fox!
gaming,"it was a spider, what a bunch of bs"
gaming,How about a hell yes/ 10
gaming,Hack it and add all the games in existence :p! Nice pickup! Have fun with Mario.
gaming,"""Can i copy your homework?""   
""Yea just change it up a bit so it looks like you didn't copy."""
gaming,Every day we stray further away from God.
gaming,"Depends, do you have Pokémon in there?"
gaming,This is why after handing over your pokemon you mash B.
gaming,"This was made, but a Halo movie couldn’t be. Smh."
gaming,One day someone is going to make a bad trailer for an animated movie to set peoples expectations low to pull a bait and switch with the actual movie turning out great and completely different.
gaming, 5 man norms or arams only way to go anymore
gaming,I hope you get some credit!
gaming,"That you’re a loser for A.) vaping and B.) drinking bud light Like with it...disgusting
(Sarcasm btw, probs younger you would only be interested in the game boy)"
gaming,"&gt;basically a bootleg third party game. it was good because it wasn't made by the sonic team

It's a legit Sonic game made by the person who did the modern ports of Sonic 1, 2, and CD.  

I agree that Sonic Team doesn't know how to make a good Sonic game."
gaming,"Honestly, can't stand her. Or Triss. Totally need a 3rd option."
gaming,"Low key the first transformers bay film wasn’t terrible.

Granted it was basically an ad for the 5th gen camaro but that’s okay."
gaming,"The blue arms i can get past because it still looks somewhat natural. The eyes, could have done better but i can see where they were heading with that. The shoes not being close to the ones from the game makes me mad, but it’s probably for advertisement deals. The hands being white to fill in for gloves is the point where i draw the line."
gaming,I can’t wait for the movie. So excited for Jean-Ralphio Sonic!
gaming,Looks better than there's
gaming,Maybe they knew they couldn't pull off a good Sonic movie so they didn't even try. Instead they went full ham with it. Like the whole Christmas ham.
gaming,"nice setup guy, nice old mobile"
gaming,"So far I have, Snes, N64, Gamecube, Wii, Switch, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360 &amp; Xbox One. Looking to expand my collection soon."
gaming,How do you even measure objectively when a game is outdated?
gaming,Plays with him self. Ok😏
gaming,I like the 90’s vibe from this room
gaming,"While this Amy is cute, Amy's redesign for Sonic Adventure is still the best iteration."
gaming,"“then you kids got to come long ruin everything which magazines and publications in the sitcom's and your TVs and Hacker shoes”

Not a single word of that resembles a coherent thought. You should be embarrassed for yourself."
gaming,It's a Pikachu knockoff obviously.
gaming," What im trying to say is guys, is that LEAGUE OF LEGEND SUCKS DICK"
gaming,"IT'S LIKE WE GO IN WANTING TO HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seriously dude sometimes you can infer quality from trailers...that's literally what they are supposed to do, get you excited for the movie. This didn't do that."
gaming,"How far does his advocacy for gun control go? Like is he pushing for no guns or better control of guns(I.e better background checks, no rifles, etc)? I believe you can still push for better gun control and have armed guards as long as you adhere to your own words. Like if he said CC should only be .22 pistols  then his guards should only have pistols that chamber .22. I just want to know how exactly he was hypocritical because I know nothing about his views on anything really."
gaming,My hand was very unstable as I can't stay completely still for the life of me.
gaming,If they do the gts and pokebank it will be much easier than this.
gaming,Honestly the stereotype for people who play league is pretty false. I know so many people who play who you would never guess.
gaming,Lube. Lots and lots of lube
gaming,Damn that live action movie... puts shame to his name
gaming,Wtf didn't like Sonic Mania? Did you not like Sonic before Sonic Adventure or just not play Mania?
gaming,Super Mario Bros. was the first live action video game movie and broke new ground. Those making the Sonic movie should just know better by now.
gaming,"yep. at least hollywood could do what they did in the early 90s and make video movies so bad they become hilariously good. Double Dragon, Mario Brothers and Street Fighter we're horribly awesome movies."
gaming,Are you serious? They ripped you off man. Thats crazy.
gaming,Thanks for reminding me the hobbit movies exist....  I honestly stared at your comment for a full minute wondering why you put LotR on there.
gaming,They should seriously just remaster Sonic Adventure 1&amp;2. I would buy that and play it.
gaming,the original Amy Rose design was so adorable 😭
gaming,"Sadly, could not completely get rid of Gangsta's Paradise without the original audio tracks."
gaming,"It's the ultimate ""nobody asked for this"" movie."
gaming,You should upload this to Deviant Art
gaming,What movie is this?
gaming,What the fuck I have so many questions.
gaming,Did he made you laft at all in the trailer.. They usually put the best stuff in there. Did nothing for me.
gaming,can you tell me which movie sence??
gaming,Only 50% broken? That's impressive. The N64 controller is so fragile that I wouldn't expect them to last a week being beat on by kids who probably don't care since it isn't their controller.
gaming,This better have dancing goombas or GTFO.
gaming,"I suggest you read, with thought, what I wrote. That one experiment is just a poke on the manifestation of the issue, the psychological priming and the change in representation of mental imagery (especially with modern graphics and soon VR) making everything more an more realistic is part of shaping the person’s brain. In case you want to refute something, refute the neuropsychological plasticity of a brain when an activity is repeated. I have seen nothing refuting that.

Computer games shaped me, when I was a kid. I played Ultima IV and took as my value system the 8 Virtues of the Avatar (being an agnostic/atheist since early childhood). Someone else, without close relatives to guide them (I hadn’t) may take something else. My point remains. Doing an activity repeatedly shapes you. The more you are immersed in a game and the more malleable you are (this is individual) the more it affects you. I agree with the good point that in the USA more carnage is caused, because USA has more guns available. But that reflects the more sane gun laws elsewhere, not the absence of individuals who would like to go on a rampage, if they could.

But let us remain with our opinions. Just brought mine out, because it is based on research and science, from many disciplines, behavioural (Bandura example) and neurological (pick any textbook since 1990- about what happens to brain with repeated activity. Like ”Biological psychology” by Kalat)"
gaming,Except adults do enjoy some kids movies. So that's not really true. Movies like Secret of Nimh hold up and Batman Mask of Phantasm was famously called more adult than the movies ment for adults at the time.
gaming,They still do in my area.  I know of about five of them that function
gaming,What Game is that ? Looks interesting
gaming,"I sit about 5 feet from a 50"" TV and anything farther away is less immersive. Thought that was normal."
gaming,"Am I the only one who doesnt hate Sonic's movie design?

It looks weird, yeah, he's supposed to look 'real.'"
gaming,I bet it was a nice little surprise when you saw that email. Too bad we won't be surprised...
gaming,"My nephew is absolutely terrified of this new ""sonic"" and says he's a monster, so maybe there is something too this one."
gaming,You should get a PS4. They are awesome
gaming,I can’t be the only one who was obsessed with how awesome Shadow the Hedgehog was as a kid...
gaming,"That actually brings up another question for me since i just watched the trailer earlier, why does this look like the first transformers with its CGI?"
gaming,These fricks cannot even be bothered...
gaming,The first one was actually good. It ended up being the only good one.
gaming,Sonic adventure 3 was all us fans wanted. Instead we got dog shit
gaming,"no. 
the ds isnt even centered and OP still somehow manages to snap a semi blurry pic as well."
gaming,Be glad Hasbro confirms that Bumblebee officially reboots the entire film franchise.
gaming,It's the teeth. The teeth are the absolute worst
gaming,"I remember the first two Gameboy Harry Potter games. Fighting a huge rat in Gringotts. Wandering around Hogwarts after Peeves curses you. 

Good games!"
gaming,Isn’t death rate a negative and riven mods can’t have more than one negative?
gaming,How’s world war z I haven’t seen any gameplay on it yet
gaming,"Bruh  
Gamer girls aren't rare my dude"

gaming,Who in the actual fuck says “Nintendos 64” instead of “Nintendo 64’s” and why are we all pretending like it’s okay?? It’s not. It’s not fucking okay.
gaming,"It's right next to the Nintendo Switch lol, was playing Bloodborne earlier."
gaming,I’d describe it as an intravenous shot of 100% pure Columbian nostalgia
gaming,Well next year ps5 comes out
gaming,"I think Jim Carrey's Robotnik has the potential to shine through the rest of the movie, even though the rest of the trailer promised a shitstorm of banality and terror."
gaming,"Don't tell anyone, that's what i was training for!"
gaming,"That's one big poop sock

Near and around the piss drawer

I caused the Armenian genocide"
gaming,"“You know what’s fuckin good, bro? *Chili dogs!* What if the hedgehog like, totally loves chili dogs?”


“Oh, he can eat them and be like, all stoked and stuff. And the fox can eat them too.”


“Nice! Oh and is the fox really supposed to have two tails?”


“I think so. He’s mutated from Mr. Eggmen’s experiments, and wants revenge. But, he also used his deformity to fly so he’s often conflicted emotionally about helping the hedgehog defeat Mr. Eggmen.”

“Wow, what great history for us to draw upon. We can do a great deal with all the the lore in Sonic’s history. Do you think he needs a scarf?”"
gaming,Jim Carey isn't good at so bad it's good because it just comes off as meh. Bob Hoskins was apparently getting shitfaced on set his performance is so blatent not giving a fuck that it's amusing.
gaming,Cheers mate we sure will have fun.
gaming,prolly not. they were most likely purchased just to make this quilt.
gaming,What the fuck where they thinking
gaming,"I know what I'm about, son."
gaming,I can approve of this situation.
gaming,Nobody cares about the switch. You should get a PS4. Bloodborne is a PS4 exclusive anyways.
gaming,Best thing he can honestly do is just own it and learn to laugh at himself. If he's truly changed then who cares?
gaming,Is this an homage to the Arthur meme?
gaming,Same reason phone manufacturers started building phones without easy to access battery compartments. People more apt to buy another phone if they don't realize they can fix theirs for 25 bucks
gaming,That's a good chooce actually.
gaming,Have a bad back and temp staying in a camper sleeping on the floor because the bed in here fucks my shit up.
gaming,"Sonic Boom was an awful version until they became self-aware and began to use it to jab at themselves and the fanbase.

Also Shadow the Hedgehog would have been a fantastic game if it wasn't a Sonic game."
gaming,Didn't even know a movie was made... Is that bad? Lol
gaming,Yeah fuck that game. I got perma banned for no reason
gaming,Why should we get out John Cena?
gaming,I thought it had something to do with video game movies.
gaming,Nah yours is much better than mine. You added the part after.
gaming,This is absolutely horrendous wtf
gaming,"You know... Sometimes I feel like I was the only one who liked Shadow the Hedgehog. :') story was cool and the alignment choices were so fun.
Then again I was 12 and I loved the edge wayy too much."
gaming,"It's a guilty pleasure of mine. As kids me and my friends would love quoting the movie. Our favorite was ""De-evolve Cretaceous"" while pointing stick guns at eachother trying to turn our foes into goombas"
gaming,"Yeah, the McDonald's here only had slides and ball pits. It on had a giant burger we'd climb into. Kind of feel glad we didn't have n64s here. I can't even imagine how greasy and sticky those would be"
gaming,"I keep seeing people say this, but I disagree with it, the game does have the best animations and interactions ever, hell, just today I shot an rpg through a wall ornament, couldn't even believe it was possible, but still there is something missing for me, I don't know what, really, but I still love the game"
gaming,So which of your cousins are you fucking?
gaming,"I tell my children of these ancient times, and they look at me like I'm insane and full of shit."
gaming,The drowning music gives me PTSD flashbacks everytime I hear it.
gaming,"I actually wouldn’t say it’s a super popular game in America. Obviously in Asia they know it well, but console games and first person shooters are what lead in America."
gaming,This is a good representation of dark souls if you replaced the laughing with crying
gaming,I didn’t think it looked that bad...the final shot of Robotnik fully bald with the goggles on looked amazing
gaming,"""Duuurrrr butt pokeymans did it""

Yeah but they got Ryan Reynolds..."
gaming,"That's what I'm saying, just look under my Cartman pop figure ;)."
gaming,Not bad. Judging for the beedrill...
gaming,I miss when games were good.
gaming,"It's...the super mario bros. Movie...

For uninitiated, what you are looking at is a god damned koopa troopa...and that's all you need to know about that movie

Edit: sorry...goomba...koopa was the turtley things, goomba was the walking mushroom fella"
gaming,Ayyy lmaooooo. Someone gets it.
gaming,I haven’t seen it is it that bad ???
gaming,Says in the ToonKing2 comics. Are those official or fanmade? I understand how they are just blending her various localized names together but is there anything to say that is her full name from an official or licensed source?
gaming,It is actually one of my favorite shooters it’s like the new left for dead if it was made
gaming,I mean yes but they're anime teeth...
gaming,"I don't like games like that anyway, I like more realistic and shooter games. Anyone agree?"
gaming,Look closely at the picture you’ll see a ps4 slim.
gaming,The legend of Chun-Li one (where a singer from Black Eyed Peas plays Vega) or the Raul Julia one?? Raul Júlia played a badass Bison imho
gaming,It’s called an average non South Korean
gaming,I'm not worried about the switch. The switch is cool but you should get a PS4 cause it has lots of cool games and exclusives
gaming,"I interpreted it as he lives in the US but it was sent to the UK but the company says they have a US address and is denying they sent it to the UK. 

The guy really did write it in the worst possible way."
gaming,The one I worked in for 6 years had game cube.
gaming,Looking forward to the announcement whenever it comes.
gaming,"&gt;All these characteristics could belong to an human

But they don't. Characters are repeatedly dumbfounded at Goku's antics and weird physiology throughout Dragon Ball. No one bats an eye at Tien's... well, eye. And even Krillin himself forgot he doesn't have a nose until Goku reminds him.

Goku's a special little whirlwind of strangeness."
gaming,"In comparison, how did the Turtles movie do when they changed the look of them?"
gaming,Maybe a PS1 with the flip up screen or maybe Atari
gaming,That would be like holding the record for jerking off the most in a lifetime.
gaming,"I literally say this in the post you’re replying to:

&gt; And I’m definitely not defending Sonic, I do think the trailer looks really bad."
gaming,Not even Bob Hoskins could save us now. Glug glug glug glug glug.
gaming,"Pretty sad. But in the end, the fans don't mind so long as the good games keep coming."
gaming,Omg so funny 😂 Havnt seenthis meme bofiere
gaming,You have plenty of time when sitting in queue.
gaming,What's up with your background?
gaming,I already said that I'm not talking about the switch. I'm saying OP should get a PS4 because they are awesome.
gaming,The third one on GBA was the same kind of gameplay and I played that multiple times over until I eventually lost it. It also had a giant rat in the beginning.
gaming,"Yup, they definitely should have stopped at one.

edit: Not sure if you were referencing the second movie ""Mortal Kombat Annihilation"" or the game ""Mortal Kombat Armageddon"". I assumed you meant the movie."
gaming,"I've been on a Pokemon kick for WEEKS now, currently playing Fire Red! Cheers!"
gaming,you dumbfucks are still gonna flock to watch it.
gaming,That is a very VERY *VERY* good question.
gaming,"But kids aren’t fans of sonic. I’m not even legally a kid anymore, and Sonic hasn’t been popular at any single point in my lifetime.

The only reason I can think any kids would like sonic is because if that animated series that came out within the last few years. And if that’s the audience they are trying to attract, why not make an animated film with those versions of sonic characters?

There is not a single reason why they had to make this a sonic film. It’s not like the characters from sonic are iconic or even that unique"
gaming,"A King's name should never be shortened, his his full name is his legend."
gaming,I laughed my ass off
gaming,"BuT yEn Is HiS tRuE lOvE

Ffs its like none or you have ever heard of an abusive relationship"
gaming,"Eh I had a shitty childhood. Abusive dad and always drunk bartender mom. Add dumbass friends and well, shit happens.

Im just glad I removed myself from it. A bunch of my ""friends"" from back then at minimun have multiple DUIs and at worst dead or in jail for murder."
gaming,"I’m sure it’ll make for silly, fun premium cable channel fare. But no known director who has any control over his or her career would take this project."
gaming,Welp. I can never unsee this now...
gaming,i guess they saw the pokemon movie take off and decided why not sonic
gaming,It just seems malicious. How could anyone be incompetent enough for it to be an accident.
gaming,"now that's perfect..  
u sir.. is a hero"
gaming,"He is legit insane on Twitter.

I still think it's not okay to try and erase him from a thing he originally made."
gaming,This proves it.  Schools useless
gaming,Me too! There's dozens of us
gaming,"It still exists and you can still buy it. You can also buy Total Annihilation: Kingdoms, but I recommend you never do such a thing. Edit: Fuck it no one asked for this but I need to rant about this piece of shit game. I played this game a lot when I was younger and enjoyed it at that time. I was super surprised to see I could purchase it so I did so. That game is straight hot garbage. Sprites are piss ass poor for pretty much everything. Sound effects are complete shit as well. One of the groups doesn't have buildings and you need to spawn more units that spawn units in order to build units faster, they blow. Units can get upgraded from kills, with every unit being worth a different amount of exp, and this gives your units better damage and armor, which is the ONLY thing about the game that was actually kind of better than TA. It should have been easy, Total Annihilation but with medival fantasy, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT IT FUCKING SUCKS."
gaming,Come on... its an honor to have your work stolen... right?
gaming,"RIP Sonic, but would still go watch it"
gaming,[Its chili dawg time yeah~!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCIUfek7y2M)
gaming,"That's fair. Even if he's still a little cringy, I at least applaud him for trying."
gaming,"Hopefully it does not disappoint, as it is not a Sonic theme:

[The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin--Extreme Boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjQDGZMH2PE)

I am ready. :p"
gaming,Making a movie out of a game is just a bad idea.... I think
gaming,Blue arms? You can almost hear the autistic screeching....
gaming,the flashbacks this gave me broke my head
gaming,"Take a lap, make it two, c'mon get going, get to it!"
gaming,"Hot boxes a festival tent with all of the above^ opens a hole at the top and breathes in everything/everyone and it's contents

I tHiNk We ShOuLd MaKe Dr.EgGmAn SkInNy"
gaming,It's growing on me.
gaming,"Screw it, I'm just gonna stick with the comics. At least Ian Flynn never disappoints me."
gaming,"Right, that's sort of my point. If they are trying to attract kids (Which if you watch the trailer, and see the comedy style... they are attracting kids) It's not really as big of a deal that the character doesn't look exact. It's a new audience."
gaming,More like RTX ON/ RTX OFF.
gaming,"yeah, thats why so many people play it after 10 years..."
gaming,I wanna see a mf speedrun Mario 64 in a McDonald’s while doing the 50 piece McNugget challenge
gaming,Fuck Sonic fans.  My entire childhood was defined by He-Man.  It came to a halt with Masters of the Universe.  What a horrible movie.  Thank God Robocop was the double feature.
gaming,Mordhau. Great game but id wait a little bit to buy it. They have some server issues and progression bugs to fix real quick.
gaming,"If you want to be a dick about it, you can't even really count Mania, that was developed by fans. Sega just published it."
gaming,Can someone take the movie trailer and just put the Green Zone music to it please?
gaming,do people play dota? or u mean autochess
gaming,"The other issue is that they aim to make platformers but obviously have no idea what makes platformers fun to people. Watching a character move fast isn’t what most people want, the fun of platformers is mostly derived from overcoming a challenge based around you mastering the movement in the game, then having the levels challenge such mastery as well as adding new ways to move that it will also challenge, but just watching a character run around then jump with timing that you basically just need to memorize isn’t too engaging, it becomes just a higher budget temple run, which really isn’t even a platformer. However, fans aren’t demanding good level design so it doesn’t happen"
gaming,"Being how this scene looks lifted directly from Hop I'm calling the ending now

  


James Marsden gets promoted to Sonic the Hedghog and lives happily ever after."
gaming,lol it feels bad for the artists who were forced to work with what they had. Pretty sure they had little to no input on it
gaming,"Don't worry Detective Pikachu is getting amazing reviews, that should stop the terror that is SOnic from engulfing videogame movie news after a while"
gaming,The eyes are disturbing
gaming,"I don’t get why they want these video games characters to look so... realistic in movies. It’s disturbing. Anyway, the least they could’ve done is give him goggles or glasses that resemble the shape of his eyes in the games."
gaming,We all have those angry days. I just do my best to curse quietly and not type anything on those days
gaming,Make sure to add the PS1 and PS2 to your collection. Awesome collection Btw!
gaming,Well I temporarily am visiting oklahoma.... Sadly all my cousins are tweakers. 😢
gaming,What you mean the guitarist?
gaming,"As someone who used to feel the same way, I highly suggest you check out Sonic Generations (it's cheap on Steam) and Sonic Rush (Nintendo DS). Also Sonic Mania, though that wasn't exactly the Sonic team that made it."
gaming,"Pikachu does have too much turn in DP though. He’s supposed to be a mouse/rat, animals which aren’t particularly fluffy."
gaming,Blame the stupid furries
gaming,The question should be what console will you donate to my collection?
gaming,"..these are not exclusive. With more guns available, people who wanna rampage can rampage. Isn’t the goal less humans who want to rampage? That would be affected by the *content* in the video games played.

So, example: Fortnite. All the cartoonish dancing and joking around and frikkin lamas makes it clear it is ”a game” as in children’s game and not related to reality in any way, even with all the shooting and stuff, a case of having fun. The narrative and the mood set by the game makers makes a difference. I would let any kid play Fortnite. Some other games, while the kids form their morality, world view, value system..still not sure."
gaming,Sonic games should read Sonic Mania
gaming,"I would watch the movie like it is a Dr. Robotnik origin story, because that is where I would expect the most (maybe only) character development.   
However, the movie will most likely be centered around the Sonic/cop duo."
gaming,"I'm not saying I like the design, but I also don't think the more videogame version would work. There is probably a happy medium though."
gaming,What movie is this picture from? I love James Franco
gaming,"I never even elaborated on what we would be saying to one another. 

I know my own friends, you don't."
gaming,How many times is this going to be posted?
gaming,"I personally think it's more related to that nasty bonk on the head he took.

Either way, I didn't mean to imply these were all Saiyan traits. I meant to say they make him stand out. That last line just refers to how there were enough bizarre things about Goku that you could create a race of space monkey barbarians out of him."
gaming,Am I the only one that really doesn’t mind this new sonic?
gaming,This is the first time I’ve thrown my phone at the bed and given it the finger.
gaming,"Idk, the cherry limeade at Sonic is pretty good."
gaming,"Arduino Uno, SH1106 OLED and model data downloaded from Ian Bell's Elite site."
gaming,Rolling around at the speed of sound
gaming,[Masters of the Universe was my first experience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8p4KXwIQ3o)
gaming,Haven’t console cycles typically been 5-7 years the last few gens?
gaming,"meh, any team based online game is like that, i see people rage on games like pubg where u arent even competing for anything else than more points for worthless crates"
gaming,Congratulations bro! I still haven’t dropped the commitment but eventually I plan to at some point until then I’m still jealous!
gaming,"I've never played any Pokemon or Sonic games, but my first reaction to seeing 3D Pikachu was, that turned out surprisingly cute. Sonic on the other hand is just unsettling. I think it helps that the Pokemon aren't too realistic, they're still basically cartoon characters, just rendered in 3D with added texture. Sonic is this weird mix of cartoonish and realistic qualities.

I think it helps that Detective Pikachu is set in a world filled with Pokemon. Some look weird, but when they all look a little weird it's less jarring, helping frame expectations for how things should look in this world. If the movie was ""Pikachu Lost in New York"", I don't think the design would work as well. Such is the case with Sonic, he's the only cartoon character in a live action movie and it just makes all his weirdness stand out even more."
gaming,"yes im not even sure OP has even played origins or odyssey. would've been better compared to what you mentioned. 
still can't get that e3 trailer out of my head from when ubi first showed rainbow six siege."
gaming,I can’t believe they’re still going through with this. It’s going to bomb even if it’s good.
gaming,"Going to a retro game store this weekend and I'll see if I can snag one or the other, or maybe both. :)"
gaming,I do this with lots of words that it doesn’t really work in. Me and my siblings enjoy butchering words. One of My favorites is dandelions -&gt; dansdelion. My sister pronounces it “dans-del-yin”
gaming,"And the sad part is that it was available on multiple platforms. Off the top of my head, there was a PC port, a Saturn port, and a GameCube port. It's my favorite 2D Sonic game."
gaming,Well what type of game are you looking for?
gaming,What are you into?
gaming,"Ay, I still play the game to this day. Let me pull alittle comedy out of this thread lol."
gaming,"Thief 1 &amp; 2, old but gold."
gaming,What is so hard to understand about that?
gaming,"I was actually going more for the whole purgatory thing. 

That's what Macca's does for me anyways."
gaming,No definitly not the only one. They have some server issues to work out. Theres only one deathmatch server i can find on the browser thats not 299 ping and thats a west coast
gaming,Sounds like something VideoGameDunkey would say
gaming,"the first Ninja Turtles still holds up. Splinter and Raphael go through some real shit. I thought I remembered liking them both as a kid. But on a rewatch when I got to II, you lost me at the 3 stooges intro."
gaming,"I was sick all day, wanted to fly my race quad (drone) and it rains all day. At some point I dug up leaf grean and had to git-r-done"
gaming,"he must be joking, thats kind of a stupid meme some people pass around about league..

the game is nowhere as toxic as it was 5 years ago."
gaming,It's the Last of Us Part 2 theme.
gaming,i actually work with a young adult client with disabilities and his two favorite things are sonic and racecars. He actually designs sonic inspired characters with fast+furious type streetcars. kind of remind me of this whole movie/fiasco.
gaming,Mario fans would like to have a word with you about movie debauchery.
gaming,Because they made pikachu look like pikachu.
gaming,Someone in this thread pointed out they would much rather watch Jim Carrey as eggman on his own just dealing with the struggles of getting prepared for the events of a Sonic game.
gaming,Wouldn't you be nice and sweet to get a guy who's coming after someone else?
gaming,seeing as sony released the emoji movie a year before they released Into The Spider-Verse. I have high hopes for 2020
gaming,he looks dirty somehow.
gaming,I mean the Sonic cartoons weren't bad per se.  Never thought I'd see something worse looking than what they did to TMNT though.
gaming,Needs Jaleel White to voice Sonic to save this.
gaming,"&gt;I don't see how it makes sense for a mouse to have such long frizzy hair,

Mice actually have longer hair than Pikachu in the trailers lol.

&gt; or how it makes sense for Mr. Mime to have disgusting little pubes coming out of his head.

Mr. Mime has always been damn creepy as a Pokemon. That's true to the spirit of the Pokemon. Also, not pubes--they're bald spots. Big difference.

&gt;They're all ugly as sin

There are so many that you simply can't say that about. Flareon, and all three of the starters look gorgeous for example. Those are near undeniable."
gaming,"Dont buy it just yet though, they have a few bugs to fix, not with the gameplay really but with the servers and progression. A lot of peoples pings are fucked. And server lag even with good ping"
gaming,Is that you Dunkey?
gaming,I don’t know if this would be better or worse than playing with my little brother.
gaming,"I have a theory about Sonic's career. Basically like in his games, it can only maintain momentum by constantly going downhill."
gaming,"They made him look like a goddamn baby Seuss character. With looks like that, I only hope it's a good movie. We'll see."
gaming,Should have gone straight up Roger Rabbit and made him look like the video game character. Got a feeling the movie will be laughed out the theaters.
gaming,"I miss this, greatest thing to do when waiting for food"
gaming,"I'm sure the Sonic movie will pay for their tuition.

For like the first year."
gaming,"This is the Sonic franchise, man.

You start off revealing just Sonic.

Then the second trailer, you start showing off some familiar friends.

And by the third or fourth trailer, they start unloading new characters and guns and the camera keeps pointing in the wrong direction while stuff pops up all over the place and oh god jesus why can they just let sonic die?"
gaming,"I don't get why any of this is ""bad"", as CG renderings of anything rarely look like the real thing.  But then again, I also don't think anyone asked for a Sonic movie to begin with..."
gaming,"I like adventure games, shooter games, adventure shooter games, indie games, anything related to that."
gaming,"&gt;This movie isn't for people who grew up with Sonic. It's for kids. It's a kids movie. They are trying to attract the attention of kids.

&amp;#x200B;

lets say if they do attract the attention of kids, it would mostly likely would be kids that already knows about Sonic.....sooo it is still a loss....."
gaming,Im really liking this game. And no game is perfect actually.
gaming,"There is something Peter's deformed face that reminds me a bit of ""Jim Carey's Grinch"". can't really place why."
gaming,Dreamcast.. snag PowerStone 2 for it.
gaming,That finally settled what was so weird in my head. Thank you.
gaming,Damn why’d they gotta go and do Sonic like that 😩
gaming,Well there's no sense crying over every mistake
gaming,"In this case, it's more like somebody stealing a piece of used toilet paper were you were about to flush anyway."
gaming,"If they aren’t making money on the back of the name of the character, why would they make the film about the character at all? 

It would be cheaper to make up new characters. 

It’s a baffling business decision."
gaming,Gondor has no king... Gondor needs no king...
gaming,What do you define as niche? Switch had a considerable market share after being available for only 2 years. It’s outpacing XB1 already. Not that it was too difficult this gen.
gaming,"Do you want to know what ruined this even more for me? I mean, the trailer made me want to pour anthrax into my eyes laced with traces of ebola. But what REALLY ruined it for me was when I had these two female friends who were so completely obsessed with Sonic, they showed me a community that I wish I'd never seen. See, because these friends of mine were actually sexually aroused by Sonic. I mean, they roleplayed as Sonic. They drew porn of Sonic. They wrote fanfictions of Tails being molested by Sonic.

&amp;#x200B;

I see this trailer, and all I can think about is those friends, and how they're probably already drawing pictures of him with Knuckles' fist deep in his ass, or something. I am traumatized."
gaming,"That was a one time deal, and Mario had already been a successful cartoon.
I think you mean Link fans."
gaming,John Leguizamo is a gift

gaming,"Oh god the laserdiscs.

And sonic had a kickass cartoon!"
gaming,I saw the trailer and the video on paramount youtube channel got 253k dislikes and only125k likes. We hate is real
gaming,I was 8 when Super Mario Bros came out. I thought it was pretty good but I was in the target age group.
gaming,Anyone else not finding games/not seeing anything on server browser for MORDHAU?
gaming,Clearly these people have never played Sonic 3D Blast or the later Xbox titles.
gaming,"Oh hell nah, I ain’t letting a local meth fox ruin my childhood any more than sonic already did"
gaming,"I think I actually vaguely remember this... haha, what a random way to suddenly notice this!"
gaming,"Maybe it's just the compression of the photo, but it looks like GTAV with zombies"
gaming,"You can.  (well maybe not with minecraft) but the holo lense dev kit is like 3-5 grand if I remember correctly.  The peterson auto museum in LA had a few I tried out.  Pretty cool, but only like 50 degree FOV"
gaming,"Adventure, shooter, indie, story, something around those genres, doesnt need to be all of them though."
gaming,"Exactly this, I liked the acting but only because it was classic jim carrey comedy, not because it was egg-man humor or egg-man anything."
gaming,"My guess because of all these reactions they going Todo some fast finally adjustments.

I bet they going the give Sonic a different look in the final act, the one we know and want, just like robotnik/eggman we saw at the end of the trailer.

Maybe he transform after he teleports through the ring."
gaming,"I mean, he's not really supposed to be a rat per se, he's supposed to be a pikachu. Pikachus are obviously based on mice, as denoted by the name, but they aren't actual mice. There are plenty of fluffier, furrier rodents, like chinchillas for example. But pikachin would have meant something much different in Japanese."
gaming,stop lying you stole it from him.

gaming,What controller does she use? My 4 year old has a problem reaching all the buttons on the DS4.
gaming,Super mario was the greatest movie every made.  It had dennis hopper.  We all know from watching space truckers that dennis hopper could turn a turd into block buster with a some of his dead pan monotone snark any day.
gaming,I’m with you. The last good game I played was Horizon Zero Dawn and before that.. we’ll damn it’s been awhile
gaming,When you put it that way yeah
gaming,Wish Gamefreak would show they care about Pokemon and fight the awful look of the abominations in Detective Pikachu. Go Sega for caring!
gaming,"I honestly loved Heroes. It’s one of the better 3D sonic games. It’s not generations or adventure, but it was still good"
gaming,To big of a gap behind pc gaming.  Trying to catch up. Imo.
gaming,"Remember when people were angry about the character redesigns in Sonic Boom? Ah, good times..."
gaming,"To be fair Sonic looks closer to the source material than Super Mario Bros did.

Edit: o*"
gaming,I think this movie has gotten shit on more than any movie I’ve ever heard of. And it’s not even out yet.
gaming,Bryan Cranston's role as Walter White from Breaking Bad makes all of his antics during Malcolm in the Middle so much funnier.
gaming,"I tried giving OP some aswell, also gave one to you, you know, just incase."

gaming,Sonic 1 on game gear: Scrap Brain. ...Sonic 2: Winged Fortress. Sonic Adventure:... god I hate to say it but Chao Garden.....
gaming,Do i need to play one to understand the other?
gaming,First thing that came to my mind too.  thought it would be at least fun to watch. Ah the youthful naivete of pre-internet America.
gaming,"Seriously, they have a lot of experience doing a good job with a variety of takes on the platformer genres. Between Mario, Yoshi, Kirby and Donkey Kong (I know, Rare and Retro, but still under Nintendo), they’ve shown they can deliver a variety of takes on the genre, on top of that, there’s quite a few different approaches even within each of those IPs, they could probably make Sonic work"
gaming,I had to look long and hard to find the comment I agreed with and here we are. There have been plenty of movies lately where the trailer has not done it Justice.
gaming,Have fun sleeping tonight
gaming,"Wanna make it *slightly* better?

&amp;#x200B;

Open the trailer for the Sonic movie.

Pause the video, mute the sound, scrub it back to 0:00.

Open [Five Finger Death Punch's cover of ""Bad Company""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWdr4UpP0uI) in another window.

Play the trailer first, then play ""Bad Company"" right as the title fades out.

Now decide whether the name of the song should be directed at Paramount for making the movie or SEGA for allowing it. Either way, *BAD COMPANY! BAD! NO PROFITS!*"
gaming,It's a remarkably disturbing interpretation of Sonic. There's some dark shit going on there.
gaming,"Hey now, the first Transformers was alright. At least the first few were watchable."
gaming,I had a dreamcast when I was younger but we got rid of it... amazing console.
gaming,Sonic games took a nosedive yeeeears ago.. these days they are laughable. Luckily Hollywood is beating a dead horse instead of humiliating a beloved franchise. (Yet)

gaming,"Just learned who Chris Chan is earlier today... And I *really* wish I could unlearn and unsee everything I learned and saw.

Edit: Christine Chan, my bad."
gaming,"No, but last time I saw, they where both on sale."
gaming,Unpopular opinion but Benji's revenge 2 is better than the original
gaming,"&gt; That’s kind of my point: we’re all 100% convinced Sonic is absolute trash because we hate the way it’s being adapted, but none of us have seen the movie."
gaming,Hahahahahaha it's too perfect
gaming,I just don't get how difficult it is to copy the game model instead of starting from scratch and creating this fucking nightmare.
gaming,BTW you can play limited minecraft on a rasberry pi 2 so I bet a custom made build of the game would work with at least 3x more power.
gaming,"This actually happened to my bro and I in Amsterdam.  He asked for a soda, I asked for some water.  We both got the same thing (unless soda water is not the same as carbonated water)."
gaming,i think the director is a fury
gaming,"I have never seen Mario Bros, but just watched the trailer and it looks like balls."
gaming,"Sonic Generations? It ewen explains why Sonic went from chubby lil hedgehog to slim aggressive one from Adventures and onward. [Though, nothing can explain this. ](https://i.imgur.com/SXuZ4nS.jpg)"
gaming,Then they should do Harry Potter.
gaming,Except you know McDonald’s exits in almost every single country
gaming,"Nobody's seen it, yet everyone is bitching. Jim Carrey looks great. Maybe Sonic's eyes should be bigger, but they could NOT look like they do in the games and cartoons. They were merged into one big eye. That would not look right here. Bitching about Sonic not wearing gloves, Jesus Christ. Can we please remember that a LOT of Sonic games were terrible unplayable garbage. Sure, I go back to 1 &amp; 2 for nostalgia sometimes, but come on, this is getting ridiculous."
gaming,His lines didn't sound promising.
gaming,Look how they massacred my hog!
gaming,"It's called the Uncanny Valley.


Our brains are wired very heavily to identify faces. That's why we see funny faces in inanimate objects.


Usually, we identify the ""not faces"" as not faces pretty quickly because they're far from one, in fact they just kind of look cute and silly a lot of the times.


But as you get closer to making a ""not face"" closer to looking like a face, our brains stop dismissing it as a ""not face"" and begins reviewing whats wrong with it. Our brain sees a face, but it's not what it wants to see as a face, so it can be freaked out or disgusted.


Modern Sonic in the top picture there is toony and silly. So we're not bothered by things like ""Singular eye"".


Movie Sonic looks a little too human, but still isn't quite human."
gaming,"Fuck it, I’m still watching it."
gaming,Who the heck is sonic??
gaming,The reason it’s bad is because it just barely stays true to the original. The Detective Pikachu trailers show pokemon that are pretty accurate to the original designs... sonic on the other hand is... well... not so lucky
gaming,"[This one from the game cube was half decent](https://youtu.be/D1jHA2Itfbw), that music is catchy as fuck too."
gaming,"At the very least, the Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle movie kept the CGI &amp; live action versions of the characters almost exactly like their original counterparts. It also had a good self awareness to it, I highly doubt this movie will be self aware about this whole thing (besides Jim Carrey obviously)."
gaming,Uhm I don’t see a gameboy color....
gaming,I just fuck hedgehogs till they are blue.
gaming,I swear I’ve seen this same tired statement for about every fan base.
gaming,Trailer looks pretty funny only if they didn't massacre his looks like thay
gaming,Mario Bros is a very important cultural touchstone along with all the other terrible video game movies.
gaming,The answer is yes.
gaming,"Sure i dont know your friends, but i Can read. You chose to be “at their throat” I’m assuming that this means slurs at the very least and then calling you kinda toxic makes sense."
gaming,Lol they’re 11 days apart
gaming,"Overcloning will do that.

Pokemon is a dystopia where service jobs are filled by clones that are patented by the big corporations.

In MOON they are harvesting moonstones as an energy source. Poor “Moon base tech Sam” is just another “nurse joy” or “officer Jenny” waiting for their two year clone lifespan to end."
gaming,I dont know. Sega seems to keep churning out Sonic stuff regardless of how badly every new game/show/etc tanks.
gaming,By muscular tone he means penis lines. Do we really need to see a bare skin Sonic with penis lines?
gaming,The forest is good I would recommend bioshock if it's on sale
gaming,This movie is gonna suck.

gaming,Sonic was never good
gaming,I think she's an octoroon descendant of an Elf.
gaming,So are the teeth
gaming,"sorry but for one, the supa marhio bruvas movhe was actually some fantastic cult level cinema. Two, the Sonic movie is not out yet, it may be great it may be shit, your meme makes unrealistic comparisons of the past and furture thus it is is null."
gaming,"*""No one hates (Blank) more than (Blank) fans.""*

gaming,Is that how people get blue balls?
gaming,"It would be incredibly ignorant of Sega and Paramount to do this.

As much as it's already being compared to Detective Pikachu, the two franchises have a lot in common, but most notably the people who are/were playing those games. All of the 'best' games out of the franchises and even the original cartoons were enjoyed by people who are now adults. Don't play with our hearts like this.

Not to mention even the kids shows on TV look nothing like this and are far far closer to the original designs. The biggest change before this was that they made the characters taller for Sonic Boom."
gaming,I also now really want a chili cheese dog....and a good sonic game.
gaming,I haven't played that game in ages. Though I have no fond memories of it.
gaming,How? Been a while since I played that game
gaming,"Looks great, plays poorly :P"
gaming,"Can't speak much on Xbox but ps4 was released almost 6 years ago and the pro 3 years after that, it's hardware although still capable of pumping out some beautiful games is getting quite dated.

I think 2020 will be a great release window, with ryzens upcoming Gen 3 CPUs, also with an expected sub $600 price tag with backwards compatibility I see no issue for playstation to be pushing a new console.

Edit: also any in game footage of upcoming triple A games, cyberpunk 2077, ghosts of tsushima, death standing. Those kind of graphics would murder the regular ps4"

gaming,It actually look good though
gaming,"I would rather just wait until the movie is out before judging it. How many people railed on the behind-the-scenes photos for the Titans TV series, and then it came out and turned out to actually be pretty good?

gaming,"They probably designed him third way to sell more Sonic merchandise, which is idiotic as fuck."
gaming,That's about the right expression Tails would have after witnessing the preceeding sh*t show.
gaming,"Yeah I’ve heard that plenty of times and I tend to agree with this prediction. Considering how streaming games is gaining popularity and in necessary infrastructure, it’s reasonable to say that this is more than likely. Many of us still like physical games but we’ve had to adapt for practical reasons."

gaming,Can it really be oc though?
gaming,Is there any video on YouTube explaining the fall of sonic?
gaming,I can assure you this was not one of the artist's decision.  Someone much higher up pushed this abomination.
gaming,"I've tried Lisa. It's gotta be like a Mario rpg or something. It's the fact I don't feel involved in combat. Lisa tried with the command imput thing but you have to have learned the move first so it is just a different way to pick the move, not execute it."

gaming,And none of us should have lived that long....these are indeed dark times.
gaming,"Then again there’s going to be people who were going to buy it regardless of whether they considered it an addition. And lots of them. Then there’s those of us who have bought it at launch, while owning another console, eventually needed to sell said switch due to financial reasons, and eventually traded in their technologically superior consoles just to be able to play games like Breath of the Wild. Sorry for the tangent but considering it’s popularity, I don’t get how you can call it niche."
gaming,"&gt; They played it to appeal to people who grew up in the 1990s

Why stop there? If we are going full 90's we should have the CGI Sonic replaced with a live action makeup'd out Macaulay Culkin as the titular character. After the battle, him and Robotnik can slam some POG's and debate whether or not the Blue Barracudas (Sonic obviously sides with anything Blue) are the actual GOAT's of the Hidden Temple.  Forget playing ""Green Hill Zone"" in the background, that would be stupid, we going GANGSTA."
gaming,"I would go far and say that only a handful of the post 06 games are bad. The only truly bad games post 06 imo are Secret Rings, Lost World 3DS, Black Knight, Free Riders, Forces, and maybe Chronicles. But the others are mediocre to damn good."
gaming,That was spectacular and super fun. Probably 1000x more entertaining than the movie will be. Goes to show how some basic personality and simple but effective character design can go a long way.
gaming,"Question, I was going for the save duke in Volga and disnt kill any cultists whatsoever but I didnt get it, the only thing I can think of that I did was kill the big fish but the guy said i killed his people"
gaming,Oh lol. I thought you meant no man's sky.
gaming,This is nightmare fuel.
gaming,"I wonder if enough people signed a petition, if they’d delay the movie and just give er another go on the Sonic character design. It’d make incredible headlines, and Sonic might have a fighting chance of not looking so awful."
gaming,They didn't even work most of the time.
gaming,You guys remember when the first Detective Pikachu trailer came out and Reddit hated it more than this?

gaming,"Did i hallucinate the part where you Said “at eachothers throats” or did you mean it in a good Way? Like “at each others throats to listen for breathing problems, dont want anything to happen to my boo”"
gaming,I knew I was going to read something weird when I walked into a sonic post.
gaming,Sonic honestly looks like an oversized child with a mascot outfit on
gaming,"That makes a lot more sense than a bunch of artists thinking this was a good version of Sonic.

If you try to make a 'best of all time' movie, you will almost certainly fail. If you try to make a steaming turd you will succeed and it may end up being so bad that it's good, at the very least you will become a meme for a few months through peak movie season...."
gaming,"Relevant story - my mom (65y/o) plays Red Alert Retalition almost daily, between Skyrim and her soap operas, of course.  She's played all of the 105 or so skirmishes at least a dozen times lol"
gaming,"I honestly don't get the hate for this Sonic at all. I don't see how it looks significantly different from Detective Pikachu. I mean, Sonic's design has been changed more, but it's been changed to make him fit in with a 'real world'.

Both look fake too me, and it bugs me that there's way too much furriness on both characters (I mean, have you seen a dog? They do not look that fuzzy.) So I don't get why people are hating on the visual style of the Sonic film while Detective Pikachu gets a free pass...

Mind you, Detective Pikachu so far looks *fun*. I think DP is gonna be the better film. But in terms of character design, I don't see much of a difference."
gaming,"I still remember when me and my best fried were trying to do multiplayer and couldn't. Kept talking on the phone trying to join each other's game and it never worked, somehow even our menus were different. Evidently I got C&amp;C and he got Red Alert"
gaming,I mean Sonic Generations did a great job of capturing this exact thing with past Sonic. Not a movie but an excellent game.
gaming,"I love the combo dial, get extra hits in plus the actual move. Plus every recruitable character has their own perks and flaws, I try to use a new team every playthrough."
gaming,What platform do you use?
gaming,"Are you an idiot? People know to judge CGI by current standards. Yeah Toy Story 1 looks like shit now, but we can acknowledge that it looked amazing for its time."
gaming,Even the damn smurfing Smurfs in the mothersmurfing smurf of a movie were treated more respectfully than the absolute smurfing that they did to Sonic.
gaming,I appreciate that this is the last complete sentence in the sequence.
gaming,"I guess games lile Subnautica, Conan exiles, Osiris New Dawn, Rust etc are all endless if theyre your type of games (theyre all pretty similar to rust, just eith different settings, single player, co op, and multiplayer on all of them, although subnautica mught only be single im not 100%)"
gaming,"It's for kids. I get it. Getting old sucks. But gamers need to understand just because a company makes a video game movie doesn't mean it's made for them.

This is a kids movie.

Again I'm not saying it's not bad design. Doesn't look great. But it's a kids movie. It's not made for adults."

gaming,I think tails is on all the drugs
gaming,I’m actually really curious to see this movie. I’ll give it a chance even though it looks wacky. That just might make it more fun
gaming,This meme never gets old
gaming,"I haven’t seen that movie since I was a child admittedly, but I thought that was a Goomba which is way worse."
gaming,"Sonic will we redesigned to be moar edgy, to appeal to the tide pod eating, monster energy drinking generation of today and be fully voiced by none other than Kid Rock.  Core gameplay will revolve around micro-transactions involving the ubiquitous rings.

Are you ready?"
gaming,In the context of YouTube: videos that can only be accessed through direct links (don't appear on searches or channel videos list)
gaming,Not as much bet yea I like them too.

gaming,"I've noticed that Navi likes to give hints when it realizes that I've been in a certain room for a while.

Otherwise, it will constantly remind me to either go to X place or that I've been playing too long and need to rest.

As for NPCs, most of what they say is just nonsense it seems. Don't get me wrong tho, it's hilarious and adds a certain atmosphere.

Like the builders in Kakariko Village ? One of em says they're all useless and the rest of them are just running around complaining about how hard they work."

If there exists a god, then he is a hateful malevolent god. The kind of god only Lovecraft himself could conceive. And you. You awakened him from his slumber. You summoned him. And now all is lost. The world is his now to corrupt and defile."

This worse than that teen titans movie lol"

gaming,"Hence why every single Tomb Raider movie has been trash. The idea of ""sex sells"" is essentially dead because people can satisfy their ""urge"" to see that kind of material in seconds, now it's more like ""bad ass sells"" such as the Marvel movies having minimal sexualizing and they sell like crazy."
gaming,This also works with movies they re-created that you grew up with. I never even saw that Point Break remake and don't want to. I understand why older people were salty all the time about this stuff when I was younger now.
gaming,"They're awful games that are only held up by the power of nostalgia and butt rock. I love them, but only because of the fond memories. I've tried to go back and replay them, but they're so, so bad."
gaming,"Oh come on, you can't tell me that the Detective Pikachu renditions of, say, Mr. Mime or Jigglypuff aren't deliberately drawing on the same sort of body horror / uncanny valley nonsense that this Sonic is.

Honestly, I look at this stuff the same way as those super bizarre Spiderman x Elsa YouTube videos. It's supposed to be a brain worm for kids in the same way. Wrong in a subtly revolting way that elicits confusion and laughter."
gaming,"I mean, from the trailer, it's basically an alien speedster vs. a robot controlling mastermind.  That's a superhero movie with the comic book filed off."

gaming,"Amy design From Sonic CD, you are correct, Tails and Sonic, are from Sonic 2 on this image, so 1992-1993 all 3 of them
Edit:Sonic from Sonic 1, my bad, so 1991 to 1992 all 3 characters."
gaming,Funny how the 2 most iconic video game characters in history now both have absolutely obscure movies that butcher not only the famous design but also any sense of the lore/atmosphere.
gaming,"Can they just edit out sonic and only make Jim Carrey the protagonist?

Like a 1:30 hours long Eggman monologue"
gaming,That's the most important thing
gaming,"No i definitely remember that game, i only had the math disc thank God"
gaming,"No, but Fowler wasn’t even D-list."

gaming,Is your problem that you dont know the controls? They are in the settings just press esc and navigate around
gaming,We need more applications like this!
gaming,"Agreed. Here on Reddit it's overwhelmingly negative but on social media it's mixed. A lot of people are actually really excited for this. The casual movie goer and gamer just sees it as a fun flick. They just see ""Sonic"". Hey nostalgia! I'm sure it will do just fine. But of course the vocal minority will beat it until it's dead in the water before release.. We shall see I suppose."

gaming,Yeah 27 years old here
gaming,I prefer her version from Sonic Riders
gaming,They really gave Sonic teeth like Taye Diggs.
gaming,Sonic is relly bad but eggman? He's a new level
gaming,"Same way people around here somehow think the Starwars prequels were good, Or at least better than the new ones. I’m old enough to remember what a sheer fucking disappointment those pieces of garbage were. But the kids who watched them back then who are in their late 20’s or early 30’s now seem to really think they were something special. It’s mind boggling how the whole tone around those films has changed in the last decade or so as those people have aged and have more of a voice.

Same shit now with people crapping on the new films. My son has enjoyed the hell out of the first two. He’s not concerned with all the bullshit. And honestly I’d much rather watch them as well even with their faults. 20 years from now people will think they were fucking great movies.

I see the same shit with something like Kingdom Hearts as well. I never played the series back in the day and suddenly everyone is trying to say how shitty the third one is. I’m sorry but I was barely able to drag myself through the previous games. Kindom Hearts 3 isn’t all that good but it’s miles ahead of the shit that came before. 

The power of nostalgia and rose colored glasses are fucking crazy. 

btw I watched that Mario Bros movie in the theatre the day it came out. I wanted so badly for it to be good. But it was shit when I was 13 and it’s still shit now. Anyone who says otherwise is insane."
gaming,"In the Sonic movie , Sonic's eyebrows are shaped like the eyes of the original character, this is a subtle nod to the fact that his small beady eyes will haunt your soul forever"
gaming,Ark is great for that man. The pvp is cancer but the single player is basically better minecraft with dinosaurs
gaming," It is really really good. And cheap. 

r/madmaxgame"
gaming,"It goes both ways, bad movie video games is becoming bad video game movies"
gaming,"We *haven’t* seen the movie, and while the trailer itself seems like a decent-kids-flick at best, embarrassing-misfire at worst, the brunt of the criticism is definitely in regards to the way it’s *adapted*: the character designs for Sonic and Robotnik, the lack of source music, the bizarre setting and story given the games, etc. 

I was just pointing out that most of this thread is full of praise for Super Mario Bros. and that seems fueled by nostalgia-glasses to me, because it is equally as ill-adapted. 

Of course you could say, “but Super Mario Bros is a good movie on its own merit, and Sonic is awful!” 

But none of us have seen Sonic, so we have nothing to base that on other than the trailer (plenty of movies are better than their trailers), and how well it’s adapted (which is moot in this case when compared to SMB).

That’s all I was saying, it was more in regards to this thread’s general reaction. And yes, *I agree the trailer looks awful!*"
gaming,"I have stardew and enjoy it, but right now the person I coop with is unavailable and the solo farming has lost its charm - that's part of why I'm asking to begin with, rip"
gaming,What if they enlarged the eyes and put a white patch of fur between the them at least?
gaming,I have no interest in seeing a Sonic movie. I have a great deal of interest in seeing an absolute abomination of a Sonic movie.
gaming,"So they will probably redo the whole thing, we got nothing to worry about... Except the plot i guess..."

gaming,"...Are you serious? (This is not a sarcastic question, I am genuinely suspicious that you are sarcastic.)"
gaming,"I was looking for this post. Mario Bros. has this hammed in ""so-bad-its-good"" feel to it but it still remains a god awful adaptation of the original designed games. You can like the movie by itself but its obviously fixing whats not broken in the same way the Sonic movie looks to be doing."
gaming,"&gt; it'd be weirder if he had smooth yellow skin and not fur, you know?

gaming,Can you tell it's been a while? You are right though idk why I thought werepire
gaming,Are you suggesting that sonic games are in average very good?
gaming,The ice cream machine broke down less than those
gaming,How hard is it to JUST keep the original look? You can throw the Resident Evil movie's director in but keep the look of Sonic and it still about 100 times better than this montrosity
gaming,"If you really like/care about something, a new thing can't damage it. It can destroy the thought of a proper legacy, but that's already long gone in this case. I grew up on the Nintendo side of things, but I can't deny sonic 1-3&amp;knuckles were awesome - and my nostalgia can't be rewritten by some poor movie thankfully."
gaming,"Ah sh*t, here we go again."
gaming,"Yes, there are buts and maybes, but if anyone wanted to break the record, he/she basically could. No matter how boring the stream or amount of people caring. It's still a record and that's what we were on about."
gaming,That is very encouraging to hear. I might give it try.
gaming,"IT HAS FUCKING HUMAN TEETH

WHO THE HELL WAS IN CHARGE OF THIS DESIGN?"
gaming,"Nope, it's Chuck Testa"

gaming,"May end up as a disaster, but my 7 year old son is a massive sonic fan and has been hyped af for this movie since he saw the first teaser image months ago. Watching it with him will make up for most of the disappointment for me."
gaming,"It's on Netflix. I'm tempted to watch it, I remember it from when I was a kid. But I kind of don't want to find out how terrible it might be."
gaming,Those controllers are home to a super virus that will wipe out humanity. It is best to leave them undisturbed
gaming,"Handheld sonic was usually quite good too, it's only on console that it becomes spotty."
gaming,"Dude, when Megatron didn't need someone to fire his shots for him.

gaming,"I mean, does my scar look like a dog's vagina? Yeah, maybe, but I'm not gonna sit here and try to get inside the mind of a dog. That's God's work."
gaming,This definitely looks like the last gen for physical that’s for sure.
gaming,"Yeah, but I don't think that Pokemon was meant to be furry in the cartoon so it's fine for him to have smooth skin... And again it is faithful to the original design unlike Sonic"
gaming,Is this why I'm not that upset over the trailer? They've been prepping me for so many years. Gonna see it just for Jim Carrey though.
gaming,Why don't you just play Minecraft?....
gaming,"I’m suddenly seeing post remembering these popping up, and I’m happy because these were my childhood."
gaming,Your fiance has never seen Sonic before? Did you find said fiance under a literal rock?

gaming,"I bet you anything they will re-model and re-render the face between now and when the film comes out, based on the bad fan reactions.  They did it for Alita between the trailers and release."
gaming,Mario brothers was a great movie and left open for a sequel that never happened and I've been disappointed for years.
gaming,"But those movies had decent cgi, this is just sanic on meth. It's like they tried to make it look bad."
gaming,KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!!
gaming,"Oh, 100% they were definitely their “own thing”"
gaming,"Even if they had a cartoon Sonic running around a real world akin to some Roger Rabbit bs, I would still rather accept that over this terrifying nightmare of Sonic. They said that it wouldnt work with the tone of the movie, but what they came up with works even less."
gaming,I’m not sure! I haven’t gotten it yet cause I’ve got finals coming up and don’t need that distraction!
gaming,I am wholeheartedly enjoying it. It's not on par with God of War or Horizon Zero Dawn but I knew that going in. It's a solid game and I'm not upset I spent $60 for it.

gaming,The Mighty Boosh is a cult British comedy series. The only reason I mention it is they had a character called the Crack Fox in one episode https://mightyboosh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crack_Fox

gaming,Real talk. As a kid I also liked mortal kombat and street fighter.
gaming,It looks to be the same level of bad.
gaming,"I'm not usually into war games but this one's going on the wishlist, thanks"
gaming,"As a film(and judging from everything I’ve seen), yes. As an iconic game character, no. Video game movies historically end up being films that embarrass all involved. Want examples? See SMB, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat 2, etc.

gaming,"Nope, didn't know about that. Which is odd because I love reading"
gaming,"Jigglypuff looks fine. Mr. Mime and Aipom seem to play up the weirdness and have fun with it. But they aren't as iconic designs as Sonic, they aren't the sympathetic main characters. Even Mr. Mime looks cuter than Sonic though"
gaming,"I was seven when it came out, and I still saw the trailer and thought ""WTF is that?""

Maybe with different verbiage, but that was my general thought."
gaming,"It has everything to do with there being no reason to be mad in his behalf at Microsoft, just communicated poorly. He stopped caring about Minecraft and its community after he sold it."

I've never seen a chili dog take 2 hands to eat. Jesus, what am I don't wrong in my life?"
gaming,"At this point, I’m gonna go and treat it as an accidental comedy. Just like how “Threat Level Midnight” was from The Office. 

The only saving grace that looks even remotely good is the fact that Jim Carrey is in this."
gaming,Jim Carrey in this is it's only redeemable quality for me.  Big maybe though. That'd be the only reason I'd even watch any of it. And by watch it I mean when shitty clips get uploaded to YT. I'm definitely not giving any money to this dumpster fire.

Harden ketchup filled the little cut around the remote, the joystick had a groove in it, the buttons made a stepping on a stick noise when pushed but I still played."
gaming,"I grew up with Sonic. I was around 9 years old and Sonic bundled with the Genesis rocked my world. Then, Sonic 2 and 3; holy shit. I still have the comics produced by Archie. 1 through 40 or so. I have the alternate no 1-3, no 0, and no 1/4. They aren’t quite worth enough to sell, but my point is that I was invested. 

Somewhere around the Saturn and Dreamcast era, it just took a nosedive. Between failed Sega systems, and multiple reincarnations of the character, I had grown completely disenfranchised. Sure, I was older and I scoffed it off to maturity. But, just recently I discovered Sonic Mania. It is sad that some fans were able to produce the best Sonic game of the last 20 years while Sonic Team just keeps screwing it up.

Really? It took Sega that long to realize what makes these games great? They needed die hard fans to essentially produce the game for them? Then the movie is announced. Ok. I’m skeptical, but maybe Sega learned from the success of Mania and will take it back to the roots. You know, throwbacks to the original games, following some of the canon of the comics (Knothole Kingdom, Sally, Uncle Chuck and such), hell, even the alternate universe with Kintobor and his smelly egg would be acceptable.

But no, we get this piece of “trailer” trash. Gangsta’s Paradise? A generic plot where Sonic seems thrown in as an afterthought? Fucking Jim Carry with his Grinch personality playing as Robotnik/Eggman but they don’t even bother to color his hair? It is on Earth instead of Mobius? WTF? I didn’t expect it to be good, but the producers didn’t do any homework at all. They just took a Fast and the Furious plot line and threw horrible renditions of the characters into it.

This could have been an awesome opportunity to reenergize the franchise, but I’m afraid it is the nail in the coffin. As someone said in another sub: “this is a horrible time to be a Sonic fan”.

Maybe I should have sold those comics before this movie made them worthless.

That said, I own a Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo may have had some misses with Mario, but damn... this still holds up. Their franchises still stand strong because they know what is appealing, and will take small risks without compromising the brand. Sonic... lets just not talk about him.

I feel bad for Jim Carrey too. He hasn’t had a good role since Count Olaf, and Eggman could have been great if the production crew gave a rat’s ass. As yet another Redditor pointed out, Danny DeVito would be a more convincing Robotnik, even if he was just playing Frank. I fear that this might be the end of Carrey’s career when combined with that horrible Grinch movie.

RIP Sonic the Hedgehog 2019. If you made it this far, thanks for listening to my diatribe."

Anyway yeah I love Sonic Heroes as a kid and will always be down for a Sonic Heroes 2. Cause if that gets announced, I'll nut on the spot"

gaming,sorry... not sure. i lived there for a month and dont recall any street names.

gaming,Well at least forward to the ending sequence. Pure gold.

gaming,"i hate that they made him as ""realistic"" as possible but hes not wearing pants and yet somehow he doesnt have a pea pee or a pooper"
gaming,Still better than the sonic movie
gaming,fuck does this even mean they haven't made a shit sonic movie like they have everyother movie

gaming,"That first conversation with sovereign is one of the best dialogues I’ve ever heard and it still gives me chills no matter how many times I replay it

“Rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh. You touch my mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.”

“There is a realm of existence so far beyond your own you cannot even imagine it. I am beyond your comprehension. I am Sovereign!”

“Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation, an accident. Your lives are measured in years and decades. You wither and die.”

“We are eternal. The pinnacle of evolution and existence. Before us, you are nothing. Your extinction is inevitable. We are the end of everything.”

“The pattern has repeated itself more times than you can fathom. Organic civilizations rise, evolve, advance. And at the apex of their glory, they are extinguished.”

“Your civilization is based on the technology of the mass relays, our technology. By using it, your society develops along the paths we desire.

“We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it. And you will end because we demand it.”

“My kind transcends your very understanding. We are each a nation. Independent, free of all weakness. You cannot even grasp the nature of our existence.”

“We have no beginning. We have no end. We are infinite. Millions of years after your civilization has been eradicated and forgotten, we will endure.”

“We are legion. The time of our return is coming. Our numbers will darken the sky of every world. You cannot escape your doom.”

“Your words are as empty as your future. I am the vanguard of your destruction. This exchange is over.”"

gaming,Original content - Reddit's favourite material.
gaming,"OC means Original Character. I.e. character that YOU, the fan, created, that's supposed to fit within the overarching universe. It's a common abbreviation found in most fandoms.

Since Sonic the Hedgehog has (a) a large fanbase and (b) characters that are easy to draw and create (supposedly), OCs became wildly popular in the fanbase. 

That being said, not all OCs are good. The Internet will keep telling you that. But there are some okay ones. Heck, there are probably some great ones out there.

If you still need more examples of OCs, think MLP. Also Warrior cats. Lion King. Splatoon, Minecraft. Heck, anything that looks furry-related."

&amp;#x200B;

They've made him look too much like a hedgehog. Which is a ridiculous thing to say about a character that IS a hedgehog. But actual real-life hedgehogs are as far removed from Sonic's general design and aesthetic as you can get.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I think giving him big cartoony gloves, a sideways mouth and one giant eyeball are a better alternative?

God, no.

But do I think more could and SHOULD have been done to tie movie Sonic's appearance to that of the games whilst striking a decent balance? Yes.

If for nothing more than brand recognition, that much is a must.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, after seeing the trailer, I'm honestly not that against it all... Like I'll probably go and see it to give it a fair shake, which is more than I thought I was going to do before the trailer."

gaming,"Sonic is one of my favorite fanchises for the sheer amount of times I've wanted to sit the development and design teams down, point my finger at them and give them a good ""No. Stop it!""  
  
But even the worst Sonic games have the best soundtracks around for some bizarre reason, so I still have to play through them because apparently that's the dude I am. The juxtaposition of baffling choices and total misses serviced by a sound team that's always giving it their all is the essence Sonic.  
  
Whatever SEGA has going on in their audio divisions and hasn't somehow lost over the last couple decades... If they could get that creativity and spunk back to the rest of the employees again... That'd be great, thanks."

I remember Wikipedia binging a lot of info on old stuff, in particular Rankin and Bass and Ralph Bakshi and being pretty upset by how many studios are defunct and how many people have passed on.  I know a lot of it is nostalgia but they really don't make things the way they used to and it's hard to accept it in permanence."
gaming,I wish that Hollywood didn’t have a live action obsession and that this could have just been an animated movie...

gaming,"Thought the exact same thing the second I saw this ""sonic"""
gaming,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills, because I kinda really want to see it..."
gaming,"This is so perfectly compared...

The problem is the new sonic looks a LOT like a kid and kids love shit that looks like them.  Some marketing dick somewhere realized the costumes they could sell if they didn't have to deal with the eye.

Also, animation is dead in Hollywood.  CG is used as life stand-in, there is no creative vision on a studio project."
gaming,"Had close to the same experience, played and evening of LoL with my friends. Raging and shouting at them and other players.

Been probably about close to 4 years now."
gaming,"I like TMNT1 and TMNT2, but TMNT3 the quality dipped. 

TMNT2 is more kid friendly. I liked TMNT2 a lot as a kid, but rewatching over the years I see TMNT1 is a better movie. It has some deep cut themes about father son relations.

gaming,"I'll get down-voted for this, but since when was regular sonic something that sparked joy?"
gaming,Let's also not forget the masterpiece that is Battleship.
gaming,I mean.. look at the Lion King trailer! It’s from a cartoon we all grew up with but it looks pretty freakin amazing!
gaming,"So OG Sonic looks not a lot like a hedgehog. 

I think they took Sonics color scheme, slapped it on a hedgehogs body then for the head blended a CGI mapped Ben Schwartz with an actual hedgehog. I would have appreciated enormous touching eyeballs too. It’s an ugly chimera."
gaming,"Exactly. Once a game stops being fun, it’s no longer a game imo. More of a chore."
gaming,Well if the movie is horrible people will barely associate with Sonic. Might just be a way to hedge their bets on the brand damage

Yeah ok, Sonic doesn't look so great. Is that a reason to whine everywhere and downvote that YouTube video to Oblivion?
Nah.

gaming,When did Sonic get a sling ring?
gaming,I know im in the minority here. But I think if you just let it be what it is. It could be a fun movie.
gaming,How can I meet this people? Asking for a friend.
gaming,Kind of reminds me of Peter from the original Jumanji
gaming,What sucks is this could be the plot of a really excellent DC Flash movie.
gaming,"OK, so when I first heard about this my first thought was to use the speed racer movie as a template. The hyper stylized cartoon look and vibe, the way they did the racing would transfer perfectly over to sonic. I think something like that could work.

..... What we're actually getting, just no."
gaming,"So what guys allowed an opinion, it’s not like he’s holding the game hostage or creating hate related things for the game."
gaming,Honestly they could've just used crappy cgi and made him look cartoony.
gaming,Why? because people keep posting the same shit for karma.
gaming,"I don't see this as very different from a remake/reboot. Only difference is that they use an existing game as their source material instead of a movie. 

I'd rather see original IP's, but those don't make as much money so reboots it is."
gaming,We all remember Adventures of Sonic The Hedghog and also how annoying bad the later Sonic Games were.

what the fuck."
gaming,"I really appreciate the detailed reply and understand more what you mean with the changes now! You're absolutely right, the alterations being made to original material are resulting in films that are totally off-putting even to fans.
&gt;I definitely get the vibe from a lot of people working on these films that it is more of an obligation and not an art. 

Yep, that's exactly what I mean! Unfortunately, I'm not sure how much this matters for the average viewer. People will support even mediocre work as long as it's sort of entertaining. That's not to say there's anything super wrong with that, but it does result in a broader sweep of less interesting cinema or at least something that more honestly describes the original creation (in terms of remakes).

&gt;And I think Aladdin/The Lion King are going to be the films that start the downward trend for live action Disney remakes. Heck, some people are already turned off by Dumbo.

I don't disagree, but Dumbo also did pretty well (making well over its cost of production). Now, did it do as well as expected? Not sure, but I do think we will see the downturn after Aladdin and Lion King, as you mentioned.

Examining Disney movies doesn't make this easier, either, since they're in a different ballpark of remakes and sequels than something without as much of a backbone (such as Ghostbusters). People have a huge amount of nostalgia for *anything* Disney."

gaming,"Fell in love with this game back when it came and havent quite played anything like it since.  It was set in modern times.  The first mission you are in Afghanistan and detain a high level target.  The next mission you are at a UN rally where civil unrest breaks out due to your actions in the first mission and must safely escort the UN VIPs out of the area through hostile crowds.


I just liked the whole story had continuity to it and it was set in modern times without being a strictly ""kill everything RTS"""
gaming,Surely that’s not legal
gaming,"Here with the unpopular opinion but I'll share it anyways. This isn't faithful to the sonic franchise because of the drastic change for the hyper realism.

He doesnt look as ""nice"".
Looking purely at the actors and movie I make the prediction it's going to do well outside of cinema.
Too many movies that are pumped out these days have a similar formula. When you're bored and looking to watch some random stuff, this...this will do it. If you're not too diehard a sonic fan you may be curious as to what on earth is happening.

This could be entertaining and different if you don't close your mind, it doesn't have to be the new look for the game world.

My suggestion, in general, if you like the system and don't mind waiting a year or two to get next gen(you've waited this long on ps4) the current Gen will always have a significantly larger library to choose from. Whereas if you wait for ps5 and get it shortly after release, you'll have around 15-30 games to choose from(assuming backwards compatibility remains constant as its been in the past). I hope this helps!"

gaming,"I think I realized why the sonic from the movie is so universally unsettling, it’s cuz they separated his eyes.  Like don’t get me wrong the body is bad too but just the fact his eyes arnt the signature stretch across the middle of the face makes him look 10x worst on the uncanny valley principle"
gaming,"I really the silent hill 1 and 2 movie adaptation, I think it does a good job of capturing the twisted nature of silent hill as a whole, the effects when it turns to night and the walls flake away really shows it well."
gaming,"Sonic fans tend to come from different eras of the character, you have the oldschool fans, then you have the modern fans and you even have the fans that joined because of either the TV series or the comics.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of which, none of the TV shows I know of were truly bad, the only major issues I recall about them was that their storylines never concluded, which wasn't an issue with Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog but was very much an issue for Sonic SatAM and Sonic Underground.

Even Sonic Boom's TV show is pretty good.

&amp;#x200B;

Sonic 06, Sonic Boom Rise of Lyric, Sonic Forces, Sonic and the Black Knight, Sonic and the Secret Rings are the only truly bad games I can recall off the top of my head (not counting the various bad racing games and the shit party game)

&amp;#x200B;

Other games in the series may not have always lived up to the hype, but they are not bad games, they're just not as good as people wanted them to be, or they have elements that people dislike (the werehog game for instance, people love the day levels but hate the night levels)

&amp;#x200B;

But the issue comes back to the list of where the fans come from, a lot of the oldschoolers don't like the new games because they don't play like the old games, a lot of the modern players don't like the old games because they're not modern, while the tv or comic book series people come to the games expecting a story on par with whatever they came from, only to be met with fairly mediocre / okay at best stories.

&amp;#x200B;

So it is a conflicted fandom in my opinion, and only a minory (as far as I can tell) like all 3 of the ""Sonic genres""."

gaming,"Did anyone ask for a live-action Sonic movie?  Sonic has to look real, not a cartoon.  That means real eyes and body structure.  I have to side with the director on this.  I didn't ask for a live-action Sonic.

I am more interested in which type of Dr. Robotnik they are using.

Edit, Just saw the trailer.

They had a decent image of Sonic at the start of the trailer.  The eyes could be a little bigger, but if you were to meet Sonic in real life, he won't look like a cartoon.

As for Dr. Robotnik, Jim Carrey would do better as Dr. Wily, but he isn't too far off from Dr. Eggman that we know.  I wonder who else auditioned."
gaming,"&gt;shredding of the Star Wars IP

Said by no fan/anyone who knows fuckall about Star Wars lol."
gaming,"Yeah, but Chris Chan's Sonichu looks better than there's, so...

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Leaving in my ""there's"" typo as an act of solidarity."
gaming,Looks like complete shite
gaming,For a long time I was really just hoping the whole new Sonic movie was a hoax. Man I guess I was wrong...
gaming,"That's how I took it too, but it still sounds like variations of the same idea.

Enough difference for a trivia, not enough for ""if you knew the context you would not repeat the quote""."
gaming,"I can agree with this, but you got to admit that the top image looks alot cleaner than the bottom."
gaming,"So just because it's made for kids they can completely butcher the design of sonic and make an objectively terrible creature out of him?

So because it's made for kids that means it can't be held to any sort of standards that have been set since the character's creation?

I hate this logic, even children probably thinks he looks stupid, and not in a funny way either, but more in a ""might give me nightmares because it's just creepy and unsettling"" way."
gaming,Charles Santa time traveler confirmed!
gaming,WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
gaming,"But human mouth Aipom is real, and he gonna get ya."
gaming,"Damn, movie Sonic looks like that monkey kid from Jumanji"
gaming,Am I the only one that I absolutely loved the Mario movie? Granted I was 7 years old at the time. But I still look back at it fondly. Maybe I should attempt to re-watch
gaming,But the sonic movie started being developed before detective Pikachu.
gaming,You absolute bastard I managed to forget about that terrible Mario Brothers film and you go and remind me it exists!
gaming,"It'd add more work for the company to have one SKU be like... a dollar less because of format.  Clearly they can put things on sale later for much more, so it doesn't make sense to market a particular format in this way.

And a buck isn't a great value for a consumer either."
gaming,"Well thats true for the large majority of women.

You have to be really unlucky on genes to not look attractive when taking care of your body as female."
gaming,"I feel like at a certain point, Western producers are going to have to concede live action is simply not the best medium for every fucking show."
gaming,"Aaaarrrgghh!

Kill it with fire!"
gaming,"The video below - whatever that was - was titled “vines I quote on the daily” and had 21 million views.  
I started to get mad, then “old man yells at cloud” went through my head.  Then I got sad.  
After typing this, I think I’m mad again.  
Any advice on how to move forward would be appreciated."
gaming,"It really is though, I’m an idiot that buys anything related to the good old days of my childhood and I’ve been let down quite a few times, mighty no.9, some crash and Spyro games, some digimon ones, but sonic... man sonic is the worst, besides sonic mania and generations, everything was shit, THEY MADE SONIC BE FUCKING DANTE ON SONIC UNLEASHED WTF WAS THAT, the worst part is I ENJOYED IT because it was a 10/10 game compared to the other wii shitty game where you have a sword and SAVE A PRINCESS Wtffffff, why they can’t understand that the game works better at 2d jeez"
gaming,"Something folks seriously need to remember, this isn’t supposed to be Shrek, it’s Hop."
gaming,those who cannot remember Santayana are condemned to paraphrase him.
gaming,All they would’ve had to do was make Sonic’s face look more like the top image and I would be soooo much more excited about this movie.
gaming,"Companies in the industry still heavily reside in the US, London, and Vancouver. Outsourcing is still a problem though."
gaming,"I know, but still, THE OLD VERSION"
gaming,The Jim Carry kind.
gaming,Imagine what goes through someone’s head after watching their well placed throwing axe get swatted out of the air like a baseball
gaming,but then people would make the same tired cyclops jokes they've been making for 30 years despite Sonic clearly being based on oldschool animation
gaming,I don’t think Sonic is gonna be as bad as Mario Bros. IMO it’ll be a just ok kids film.
gaming,Sega does what Ninten-does
gaming,"&gt;Pikachu the Hedgehog

Sonichu?"
gaming,Let people hate things bro
gaming,"This new sonic is going to just create more memes than it's original intention. I can't even take that ""new"" design even remotely seriously."
gaming,Someone got the wrong info
gaming,"Not all recent Sonic games are bad. Some were really good like Sonic Mania, Sonic 4 eps 1 and 2, Sonic Generations, and Sonic Lost Worlds were all great. And it might not be the best by any means, I really loved Sonic Unleashed."
gaming,IIRC Dave even mentioned his desire to play Marcus one day
gaming,It would be a nice plot twist if they killed this Sonic at the end.
gaming,"Ah, the McDonald's N64 stand- a great place to catch a disease."
gaming,Show me de wey
gaming,They'll get him gloves and big shoes problem solved!
gaming,"God damn it, every hope Sonic Mania has brought up is shot to blue shit."
gaming,I hope they don't use that Dr. Robotnik.  I preferred the other cartoon with the dark Dr. Robotnik.
gaming,"I mean, tbf to Hollywood they're only selling what ppl are buying. At least in America, it is very hard to sell the general public on an animated movie as anything other than something that's made specifically for kids. Given that they supposedly aimed to have some of that nostalgia factor, I'd assume that means they were hoping to aim for a wider audience than that. Overall, I'd think somewhere with a healthier animation culture would probably have been comfortable doing it as an entirely animated movie."
gaming,That must have hurt like hell! (Scar tissue is extra sensitive)
gaming,"I actually thought it was a joke the first time I saw it. 

At least with the new Pikachu movie, they retained the original look. This Sonic is straight up awful."
gaming,Beat the boss and you get yourself into one. Then you can have DMC 5 track. ;-) the deal
gaming,"Final fantasy VII: Advent Children and Final Fantasy XV: Kingsglaive are pretty damn good. There's also a few other exceptions

If movie makers are going this route though, and it appears they fully intend to they'll have to let people that love whatever live action version they want to make or they end up with a movie that looks half assed. 

There's not very many live action versions of popular series that can live like that, mostly because of the way they are produced."
gaming,Most kids are fine with it
gaming,How easier and better it would it be to animate if they stuck with the top design
gaming,I believe there is a total conversion mod for one of the earlier games.
gaming,"That one lonely kid making cringe-inducing artwork of his fangasm over this movie. Plus the 3 other people he can barely call friends who also like it.

Going to be a hard life defending his or her life choices."
gaming,It’s more than video games are hard to make into movies.
gaming,Is that the old jumanji?
gaming,The cartoon was pretty sweet if my memories from being 10 years old are any guide.
gaming,He’ll have to fight past Lemmiwinks The Gerbil King first.
gaming,Just like all the hypocrites that call Fortnite shit.
gaming,I'm actually so happy this atrocity is being created strictly for the fact that it's a meme and cringe goldmine.
gaming,Sonics nipples would be lit
gaming,"That's literally the last thing I'd want to happen to me. Oh, and my brains being eaten, that'd be pretty bad."
gaming,"I think the smart money is on Switch honestly. You have a good PC that will pick up a lot of indie titles, most big games are on PC anyways, and Switch has the ability to game on the go better than anything else with the added benefit of supporting and getting Nintendo exclusives (their company practices seems the cleanest in the industry).

Don't get me wrong, Spiderman and God of War are simply masterful and I hope they shape the industry but spending what, £2-300 just for those when you could have the versatility (game on the go, game solo at home, invite some friends over and party game, bring the Switch to your friends to party game) and library of Nintendo for a similar price. Almost a no brainer and I have a PS4."
gaming,"Im boutta play some tf2 for the nostalgia, I havent played since 2013 this is hella makin me sad now"
gaming,Glad I wasn’t the only one who felt this.
gaming,"Trailer also has more down than upvotes on youtube. Everyone I know seems to have hated it and most aren't redditors. And I'm in my 30s now, so I'd imagine we're the main target audience in this recent 90s nostalgy movie boom.

Unless someone was expecting a Sanic movie instead of Sonic movie, I don't think anyone is happy with hot *that thing* looks. It really is stuff of nightmares. I bet I wasn't the only one who actually paused the video and went out of fullscreen mode to see if it really is real and not some troll video when I first saw it.

Also the soundtrack choice is just baffling, they have game series with one of the most memorable soundtracks in history. Seriously when opening that trailer for the first time, the thing I was mostly looking forwards to is to hear what they would do with the soundtrack, 100% expecting a new rendition of green hill zone or some other classic.

Overall it just doesn't feel at all like a Sonic movie."
gaming,"Percy Jacksons ""the happy meal thief, with the Olympians'

gaming,"Not OP, but I believe that’s what OP meant."
gaming,"I don't care about this movie but you literally have no idea what you're talking about, unless 'many' have already seen the movie"
gaming,Product placement with characters playing a game? It's going to be another fat guy playing Fortnight isn't it?
gaming,liberals get rekt 😎
gaming,Who's the freaking numb nuts that decided to make sonic look like that?
gaming,"I'd agree cos I'm not a movie maker. Most games are mostly exploring, which is ok in a TV show which is long, but making media about a single character exploring would be very boring."
gaming,In this picture you can see how early kids got prepared to fight in the xbox vs playstation wars and how they unknowingly accepted their brutal fate
gaming,Why does it matter? I'm pretty sure people are allowed to be upset about it even though they may not be super hardcore Sonic fans.
gaming,How about the ability to turn off matchmaking and just play with a friend or 2 without randoms that fuck around when your actually trying or the opposite when you and your friends just want to fuck around without randoms
gaming,Just binges through game of tones ep803 discussions and everyone's triggered about it omg. GOT/ASOIAF FANS are blessed compared to sonic fans and pokemon fans
gaming,I mean he's literally played by Jim Carry.
gaming,"Holy shit, he looks even WORSE on that poster somehow."
gaming,"Never been a fan of how they do modern Sonic's mouth. Sometimes he's constantly speaking entirely through the side of his face, and even his teeth are nearly vertical. Wreck-it-Ralph did a decent version of his mouth, where he largely talks with both the side and front of his mouth, with various sounds like O having his mouth move to the front for it. I'd rather if they just kept it centered except for side shots and smiles."
gaming,Is this a quote from The Wire?
gaming,Smart person! But in contrast with the Chevy.... ehhhh?
gaming,I'm just waiting for the day they crap out a live action Metroid or Exo-Squad movie. By that time the butchering of my childhood by Hollywood will be complete.
gaming,Still looks better than the Paramount abomination.
gaming,"Hmm… just like we’ve been doing now, with Reddit’s multiple front page posts regarding the trailer."
gaming,Perfect example of drug abuse
gaming,This was sort of the opposite of the dozen times I've been flung from horseback because of a tree stump.
gaming,"She has one dialogue prompt, where if you press b it loops. I believe it’s soon after the first gym, cheren"
gaming,That doesn't mean anything.  Jim Carrey is an actor.  He acts as the director intends or they find someone else.
gaming,The funniest part for me was Dutch waiting for Arthur
gaming,"When did he start being referred to as simply Eggman? 

In the early 90s, we just referred to him as Dr. Robotnik.  And damn was he fast when you chased him after you broke his craft."
gaming,"Alright than, let’s get crazy! (Pulls out bladed motor cycle)"
gaming,"Imagine Space Jam, but like this."
gaming,I'm desperate for the WWE license to be split and somebody anybody but Yukes (they are the real problem not 2K) make a second wrestling game with a new engine and stop recycling a 20 year old one. Give EA a chance for all I care.

gaming,It's the eyes that get me. He looks like Peter from the OG Jumanji when he was turned into a [half-ape](https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/4efa7c170809f47e2ee8e4ba0ca29c1f/203426769/Screen+Shot+2016-02-18+at+1.45.58+PM.png).
gaming,It would! But it 100% won’t happen!
gaming,"Unfortunately there are a ton of people who are going to go see this only because it seems so bad it's worth witnessing. Honestly effort this low shouldn't earn a penny,but I'll bet they at least name their money back thanks to morbid curiosity."
gaming,His eyes don’t even have a look of surprise in them all. He looks like he’s at the dentist’s.
gaming,"Um, because that is obviously unrealistic. /s"
gaming,Aren‘t only the intros lice action and the rest is a cartoon? In what way did the movie draw from it?
gaming,:D my favourite game
gaming,It’s the little victories. In between the constant shitting on.
gaming,You just made me realize how truely bad the casters fucked this film.  Eggvito could've actually made it a decent film!
gaming,"Yeah.

Like, it’s one thing if you’re making up your own characters, you have people coming in with fresh eyes.

But with the exception of that one Pikachu, when they do this, it just butchers the existing characters people are coming in to see, lol."

gaming,God my friend was so pissed at me when I had to keep his Gameboy Colour for the night (I seriously can't remember why) and decided to play Pokemon on it (without his permission). I lost the game and it never got saved so he lost all his progress and he was extremely angry at me since we were both kids at the time.
gaming,Lol better than mine. You actually have something to play on.
gaming,This is literally a still from the trailer.
gaming,"Logic of redditors if one has seen it or played it, it has to mean everyone in the world did."
gaming,I’m right there with you!
gaming,Look how they massacred my boy
gaming,"It isn't really even as realistic as possible if you ask me, it's just some strange uncanny valley abomination."
gaming,I’m glad Sonichu is finally getting the movie debut he deserves
gaming,Wait this is a joke right? That's not really how he looks
gaming,"Dude, you nailed it"
gaming,I would rather share a bed with that beauty than have the new sonic shit on my childhood
gaming,That you’re insufferable because you vape.
gaming,"That's because with Pikachu they just made him look real without drastically altering his body shape, color, face, and turning him into a child in a furry costume."
gaming,"It looks like both a bad film and a bad adaption. We know the movie isn't out yet...this happens every time a movie by all standards looks horrible...people come out reminding us that the movie isn't out yet as if we don't know that fact that sure it's technically possible that the trailer is completely misleading. Would you ever bet on this movie turning out amazing though or even good?

The thread is lots of back and forth about the Super Mario Bros movie. With lots of the praise not being of sincere wow what a great movie but just how enjoyable its flaws are and it was one of the first attempts in a genre that hollywood still fails at to this day."
gaming,Highlight. I seen it mostly when they put artwork in game mags.
gaming,Id rather they collectively scrap these recent live action adaptations across the board
gaming,"I think we should crowdfund a fan-made movie, and let this piece of garbage rot in the theaters."
gaming,What they have designed is something my brain would come up with during a nightmare
gaming,"""Luke I am the farthest"" 
Gorgeous Washingmachine First American President"
gaming,"I'm not really a sonic fan, but the fact that there were several, *several*, steps in the design processes where anyone could have and should have realized that they were going in the wrong direction is what seems to be pissing a lot of people off. In an age where we have amazingly realistic CGI in movies (and even pretty damned good visuals in games, that render real-time), this is a huge step into the uncanny valley. 

They take clear design elements from his character (like his gloves) and, instead of you know, giving him gloves, they decide to just paint the fur on his hands white. They went for a very human-esque look for a creature that is very clearly not human, and it plants it squarely in the ""uncomfortably creepy"" category.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, with all things being considered, they would have been far better off just canning this live-action idea and just doing a full CGI movie, because they can clearly work (Big Hero 6, Moana, Frozen, How to Train Your Dragon (1,2,3), Inside Out, The Lego Movie, Wreck-it-Ralph, all the Toy Stories, Up, Wall-E, The Incredibles(1,2), Finding Nemo (and Dory), Ice Age, etc, etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

It feels as though Sega is just trying to copy the idea of Detective Pikachu, which is able to do it right because (with the exception of the humanoid pokemon like Mr. Mime), they pokemon more or less look like pokemon."
gaming,"It’s why I always look at the headlights on cars as a pair of eyes, and wall outlets as a face that looks like this =o"
gaming,"There have been —brief— moments that I’ve thought, “Maybe it isn’t SO bad.”

And then I see any picture of actual Sonic and it propels me through the remaining grief stages all over again."
gaming,"Obligatory we get it, you vape"
gaming,"It's an older meme, Sir, but it checks out."
gaming,"So do you play lying on the floor? 
No gaming chair? 3/10"
gaming,"Not that I would *EVER* recommend *ANYONE* even take the slightest look at anything even remotely related to the sonic fandom, Sonic Dreams Collection is something really special. If you haven't seen it before, I HIGHLY recommend polygon's playthrough of it [in its entirety.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3sUl2pMGvE) If you like absurdist humor and really clever game design, all of Arcane Kids's games are equally fascinating, but most of them don't have as much vore and unbirthing as Sonic Dreams Collection. My other favorite by far is Bubsy Visits the James Turrell Retrospective Museum. All their games are way more fulfilling to play yourself, but [dunkey's video of it gets the idea across pretty well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WLIA-z2GVU) It's not as complete as polygon's Sonic Dreams video, but still a good sense of what goes on in their games.

Edit: I dunno why I didn't mention in the first place but [All their game are readily available to download and play for free off their website.](https://arcanekids.com/) They're a real treasure."
gaming,Ehh no. Dota players have a huge inferiority complex with LoL
gaming,Seeing the top one just made it much worse.
gaming,"Oh wow I didn’t know it was so bad, haha. You’re right, the commercial did make it look good."
gaming,"With all these ""fixed"" images of the sonic movie trailer, I would love to see the fans somehow replace every frame of the movie that has the bad sonic design with good sonic design."
gaming,"It was... alright. But it certainly didn't play to the source material's strengths and instead tried to be this realistic action movie that just came off as cliched and pretty boring and definitely didn't think ah yeah, they nailed Tomb Raider! I know it's naive to say, but honestly I feel like I could make a 50x better TR movie if you gave me, you know,  millions of dollars. Or at least one that reminds me more of what made the source material fun."
gaming,"To be fair though, Sega did still do what Nintendidn't. They made a horrifying movie"
gaming,It’s as if they were trying to make move sonic look as hideous as possible
gaming,I think you misunderstood what people talk about here

gaming,Just did a replay of Lion King with 6 yr old daughter it had been 15 years since I had last beat the game. And is it just me or man was that a pretty difficult game?
gaming,"I think the thing that I hated more than anything in the trailer was that the 3d model doesn't apear to be affected by gravity. In Who Killed Roger Rabbit, the toons are all drawn so that their hair or ears move when they make sudden movements. And it works. Sonic is just sort of plonked in there. He doesn't fit into the world, and seems largely unaffected whether he's upside down, running about, or rapidly felating Jim Carey."
gaming,Hey fuck you Luigi.
gaming,Awesome! My 3 year old (almost 4 as well) son recently beat Castle Crashers. He was so excited he wanted to call family members and tell them. Now he insists that we unlock all weapons and characters.  😊
gaming,But this doesn’t even look anywhere close to the modern sonic model. It’s like they purposely tried to make it look bad

Edit: for the curious...https://youtu.be/5t4n8UV7_OQ"
gaming,"I actually looked this up a few years back, also only having known him as Dr Robotnik. Here's an explanation I found online quoted from the game designer:

*When the game was originally developed in Japan, they called the character Eggman. That was the name of the character, but when the game got localized and ported into the Sonic the Hedgehog that we know in the West, they decided to, without confirming with the development team, change his name to Ivo Robotnik or just Robotnik. That’s kind of when everyone first learned about the character. Of course, this was without consulting the people who made the game. They just kind of went off and did it. It became super popular and everyone in the West kind of learned about the character as Robotnik. That went on through the “classic” series in the Genesis/Mega Drive era, but as far as the developers are concerned – the ones who made the character and the leaders of what this character is doing next – we really didn’t want to have anyone in the universe with two names. To us, he’s Eggman, but in the rest of the world he’s called Robotnik. We wanted to unify that into one name moving forward. This is something I actually did in the Sonic Adventure series. I made it so that we understand the character’s name is Robotnik, but his nickname is Eggman, and as far as everyone is concerned in the world now, we’re just going to call him Eggman as his official name.*"
gaming,I couldn't put my finger on just what in the redesign is so... off. Until just now. Sonic with two separate eyeballs is so wrong

gaming,"I mean, the top one is of Sonic being frightened by a villain and the bottom one is of sonic being mildly surprised by a human (in the context of the situation of said screenshots) They aren’t of equal levels of emotion to begin with so I don’t think your comparison is quite fair."

gaming,They do have similarities so I understand why you wouldn’t want to get bored of them. In my opinion Fallout is much more entertaining and better than Skyrim
gaming,"Haha, I didn’t mean to put you in the hot seat... but the next time you try to educate me on the historic trend of inferior film adaptations sourced from the video game medium- I will snap back every time with Goldeneye.. it was so good they made a James Bond movie based off of it and it was one of the better Bonds tbh."
gaming,The new sonic looks like peter the kid from jumanji (original version) that starts turning into a monkey!?
gaming,They made his fur White to replace the gloves so belly matches hands

gaming,"The same market as every other piece of shit children’s movie. Yogi Bear made $100M, kids didn’t really quite grow up with him either. The last MCU movie of the year is July and Frozen 2 comes out 2 weeks after Sonic. Sonic will bomb, but $10M OW is hugely unrealistic"

Unlike things like Pokemon which seems like its gona be a super predictable show, and gonna try and be all heartwarming and with some stupid backstory, and Pikachu is gonna feel bad for him after Will Smith's son freaks out after losing, I mean I've seen that movie at least a dozen times. 

With Sonic, it will be zany and hopefully wild, its why bad movie are better cause they don't follow same tired ideas as other safer films."

gaming,"I guess I'm just not a huge movie buff to let the smallish stuff get to me (I loved BvS and Justice League, fite me), but I appreciated it for what it was. It's a hell of a lot better than the Angelina Jolie TR movies that's for damn sure. 

That being said, Sonic looks like a travesty and they don't make fire hot enough to burn this away."

gaming,"Sonic will attract by being something bright and colorful with a bunch of G-rated quips. And many kids will also know Sonic because of the Sonic Boom TV show and maybe Smash Brothers, if nothing from the main games.

The parents of today are yesterday’s 90’s kids, the people who grew up with Sonic. And it’s not like it not being as popular of a brand anymore won’t get butts in seats. Plenty of other CGI kids films with much more obscure characters made money. Like do people really think parents took their kids to Alvin and the Chipmunks because they had a personal connection with the franchise, or because it was bright and loud and cute and silly?"

gaming,"Seriously, I don't get it. You're making the character entirely out of CGI. It would have probably been easier to actually make him LOOK THE WAY HE SHOULD. It would have been easier, it would make more sense, and most importantly, it would appeal to the very demographic you're making this movie for.

How hard can it be to figure this stuff out? How stupid are the people in Hollywood? I just don't get it."

gaming,"The whole idea behind Detective Pikachu is that film noir style in pokemon universe is unexpected and fun twist. 

Making a character like Sonic look realistic and more human-like just seems weird. Especially when Carrey's role and everything else really makes it feel like Who Framed Roger Rabbit like cartoon style would've been far more fitting in the overall theme. 

It just feels like they wanted to emulate what was done with Pokemon IP so succesfully, but completely misunderstood why it worked for pokemon."

gaming,"They've actually started supporting alternate playstyles a little bit, as long as they function differently to the main build, and aren't overly unfair to play against. They buffed ap shyvana, letting her nuke people with fireballs. Tank karma has become a thing. 

You probably won't know who they are, but some of the newer champs have multiple build paths. Kai'sa can be a crit adc or ap on hit, neeko can be built burst mage, or on hit."

The production design on Eternia was fantastic and the Castle Greyskull interior was a thing of Art. The score is also wonderfully bold. The rest of the film really is only good for camp nostalgia, and lessons in what not to do."

* Arm hair matches leg hair
* Proportionate hands/feet
* Visible muscle definition

I do think they put a bit more effort into making him a more ""realistic"" interpretation of a super-fast giant hedgehog than just giving him individual hairs. Whether they *should* have or not is technically debatable, but I'm seeing a pretty big consensus that the Sonic in this movie looks... jarring."
gaming,I did and you got it wrong...
gaming,She’s a noob she hasn’t completed that mission smh give it some time
gaming,"I think it's dependant on the game your playing. If it's a heavily story driven game I think it's fair to expect an easy mode or at least some implementation that helps struggling players but I don't believe that it's a requirement for all games nor do I expect it to be. 
When I was younger I played games for the challenge, now as an adult I pretty much exclusively play them for the story and while I still play games quite frequently so my skill level hasn't dropped all that much it's safe to assume that that's not the case for a lot of people and they don't have the time to spend getting better.

In short I don't believe from software need to add one but I do believe they have a place in games as a whole."

Interestingly Freud also wrote about ""cute"" like he did ""uncanny"", even though many people discredit Freud as pseudoscience."

gaming,Thanks! I can't unsee that horror.
gaming,"I think it's biggest missed opportunity was that it didn't let the player fly any helicopters, planes, etc. I like to think of it like GTA 5 but the missions aren't always guns blazing and you can be in and out of a mission like a ghost. However, tbh, the enemies might as well be deaf (other than gunshots) and they're completely blind if you use the distract hack, so it can be a bit too easy."
gaming,"The moment I saw this picture the term *uncanny valley* sprung to mind and I figured someone else would mention it. 

The Pokemon movie is weird in that they’re portraying animated characters semi-realistically while still capturing the essence of their design as fictional creations, with all their exaggerated features intact. The CG LOOKS like CG and we all accept it for what it is.

... whereas Sonic looks as if they’re taking a character with exaggerated features and turning them into real-world equivalents whilst trying to make the CG look more realistic than if it was just CG. It’s a very odd choice and it’s no wonder it doesn’t look right. 

Imagine if they portrayed Pikachu as a literal yellow Mouse, or Togepi as a bird egg with a deformed chick sticking out of it. While we’re at it, let’s make Charmander a bipedal gecko that runs around screaming the whole time because it’s on fire, or Squirtle a turtle that’s constantly making gurgling sounds as it drowns in its own water supply. 

“Realistic” doesn’t always equate to “better”. I just don’t get how NOBODY on that team realised that Sonic just looks creepy?? And Jim Carrey will make a fantastic evil character, sure, but he’s nothing like what I’d expect from Robotnik."

gaming,"I don't think an easy mode is necessary, on the whole. I don't agree or disagree on the whole ""should"" matter; it's up to developers, and I prefer that some games that can fit them in add both hard and easy modes, where possible. I've wanted a traditional Hard mode in Zelda for decades, in fact, because I think that series would be more served by the addition of one, and would fit with the general methods of arbitrary difficulty increase that games do.

But... that aside.

I don't think Dark Souls or typical Souls-style games would really be served by a difficulty reduction. There's an argument to be made for Sekiro, and one I can't participate in to the same degree since I've taken my time getting to that one. But, for standard games in the series or genre like Dark Souls and Bloodborne, there's a simple perspective I have on it that many share.

I think somewhat controversially that the Dark Souls games aren't actually difficult, not in a standard way. They are *challenging* games, but enemies, bosses, and situations are like puzzles. Everything is a pattern, the patters are just more complex and less forgiving than standard puzzle fights that boil down to hit the big eye and move to the back of the room. All of the Dark Souls games are about learning how to take on every challenge--through adversity, sure, through struggle and defeat, but still about learning.

Reducing the difficulty of such games would have several notable downsides, with only one major upside. That being, people who struggle with the core game to a point of unplayable would gain access to the entirety of each game. But that's it for the positives.

The downsides mean you put less onus on the players in easy mode to adapt and pick up the game's desired level of skill, it instills in them less hopelessness and defeat to tie into the game's themes, and it offers an easy road for players to take who might otherwise actually learn how to play around the game's challenges, who will be tempted to switch down to an easier difficulty when they start to get killed, not realizing that it's always a trick or pattern you pick up that helps you win, and not some stroke of luck or the reach of equipment you don't have.

You have the game losing that feeling of imposing dread, of menace with each new area and boss, you have a weaker atmosphere when players start to feel less like every enemy is a threat, and players are avoiding the need to work on their dodging, their timing, their survival skills, and so on. And on top of that, you're doing this by diverting programming time and resources from balancing the difficulty of the core game, and fighting against the main dev team's vision for the game. And of course, it diminishes every major feeling of success the game gives the succeeding players, which is perhaps the most well-known strength of the series to date.

There's a lot of people who call this argument, ""elitist,"" who say that those who support the stubborn high difficulty of the Souls games are touting difficulty for difficulty's sake, they're fighting to keep more casual players out, or just sticking with tradition for no reason. That's an extremely reductive statement to take; it implies at its core that the argument in support of the current, intended difficulty is just a weak and biased narrative rooted in external reasoning, which may be true for some, but it's not true for the majority.

Some games--even many games, can fit in altered levels of difficulty. I mentioned Zelda before, because making Zelda enemies easier or harder is... well, it's been done. Countless game have tweaked the health of enemies, or how much damage they do, or both, to alter the final experience. For some games, like the aforementioned Zelda series, that would be fine. Zelda at its core isn't about the challenge posed by your enemies, that's just a  feature. And it's a game that could use more tweaks--like actually making bosses in many of the middle era games a real threat that takes some clever thinking or tight fighting to beat. But just making it easier? Or harder? Not going to undermine the game's core philosophies.

For something like Dark Souls, the series has been about pushing you as a player since the very beginning. The series *wants* you to have trouble, both to evoke a certain mood and create a certain world. And it wants you to get better, so it's not just your character leveling up, but you as a player. ""Git gud"" is just as reductive, but it beats at the heart of the real series mentality; while framed as a half-insult, used as a jibe by presumed players against the presumed casuals they seem to hate, that's just a weak adaptation of the real meaning. Dark Souls isn't saying you aren't good enough, it's telling you that you *can* be. The series 8wants* you to git gud.

And, simply put, if you start off with a ""git gud"" button, both the buildup and the payoff the game provides are watered down. And while it is just an option, so is the developer implementing it. Not giving players that option is part of their vision."
gaming,"I want to bet Sonic looked exactly like the original game version when first designed. 

Then film executives and producers critiqued and “Frankensteined” it to its monstrosity that is today.

gaming,"Tbh now that I think about besides final fight and sonic games SNES did reign supreme for me and my brother. Just sonic games and final fight made me play genesis. Uniracers and Sim city 2000 are just some examples about great the SNES was. I didn't have a PC but that red cartridge of doom was amazing! Those midway wrestling games and NBA jam was what my neighborhood was addicted too. Anyways downvote me it was damn exciting time to be a kid. Except for shitty games like home Alone etc. All hail doom troopers and earth worm Jim. Suck quality

Edit: meant to say suck quality at the end. Because at that time when you saw batman you asummed you liked batman so it must be good. You bought it and was like fuck this game. Games like battletoads vs double Dragon came by, by accident and you just didn't stop playing them.  There was no review sites. You just saved up your allowence and gambled at the pawn shop. Now days it's way more transparent. Thank god super Mario world 2 came with the system..."

gaming,"Honestly, even if every single other aspect of the movie was well done, I couldn't possibly enjoy it. That thing makes me uncomfortable. I could not sit there and watch a movie that revolves around this absolute abomination. I have no fucking idea how anyone involved in this movie thought that this character model was acceptable. It's terrible in every way."

gaming,"Marvel has its own formula now. It's less ""badass sells"" and more ""badass-with-snarky-quippy-humour-and-a-villain-who-is-basically-the-protagonist-but-evil sells"". They've essentially created their own genre. When you go into an MCU movie, you know exacrly what you're getting into. Marvel movies sell like crazy because they're inoffensive, safe, predictably satisfactory entertainment for the whole family and people know that.

What I'm trying to say is, the MCU movies prop each other up. The less-than-stellar ones can ride off the coattails of the better films and still make a crapton of money."
gaming,"That argument doesnt hold up. People still watch older movies despite seeing how bad the cgi is, because we recognise how good it was in it's time. Just like how we can still enjoy older games."
gaming,"I hate zomboes, they’re the worst!"
gaming,I think eventually we will ironically reach equilibrium with a form of live action where almost every aspect is heavily “fictionalized” with CGI.

gaming,Then how? Why? Did they not have childhoods??
gaming,Said nobody on here....
gaming,The bottom one inspires pure fear.
gaming,"Not *just* because it's a bad adaptation; it's also because it appears to be a buddy-cop movie with Sonic as the loose cannon, a CGI-fest, it has a humanized Sonic (which reminds people of the 2006 Sonic game) *and* the fact it claims to be an origin story for Sonic, which makes all the above even worse.


SMB was a terrible adaptation and even my 7-years-old, PC-gamer self knew that, but it was a charmingly funny movie once you got past the travesty. This may yet be the same, specially given Jim Carrey's talents, but it has plenty of other sins to make up for before that."
gaming,To bs fair. Sonic has sucked for about 25 years.
gaming,I think everyone just wants to enjoy a really good sonic property and they are dissapointed that this looks like yet another shitshow with sonic in it.

I used to love sonic as a kid, even more than mario... and the 3d era games where tough enough, and now we got this? I can't believe how they can continue to mess up sonic like this. 

At least we got the wonderfull sonic mania... heres to hoping we get more of those games, because they did sonic right!"

Epic games only earned fame from almost the entire world with fortnite. Before fortnite, was other games like paragon, IF blade and others, which was fun.

gaming,"EXACTLY

Just because we aren't registered Sonic fanclub members making Sonic OCs on DeviantArt doesn't mean we aren't going to be disturbed by this. Sonic is a cultural icon as a cartoon and videogame character, and this is a movie that will be IN THEATERS NEAR US. It's not some obscure piece of media failing to portray an obscure character, this is a famous character almost everyone in our generation has watched on TV or played a game as at least once, being advertised and pushed into our faces and god damn its ugly and creepy and sad to see the industry make such a misstep, and we'll say that. Just like the Will Smith genie, is totally open for judgements by non-hardcore genie fans, but this is actually, somehow, way way way worse."

gaming,"Yeah, I can't see the uncanny valley everyone else is talking about."
gaming,Honestly it kind of looks like one's gonna be a 6/10 movie and the other's gonna be a 7/10. I think what's going to make the big difference is that Pokémon is a hot property (and Ryan Reynolds is a marquee name) and Sonic hasn't been for like fifteen years.

gaming,Lay off the skooma!
gaming,I mean at least that was at a time when emojis were still super popular. Sonic games haven’t been in the mainstream for an eternity.
gaming,"It makes me sad. There’s so much hate when these guys probably thought people would fall in love with the character.   
I just hate when people get shat on when trying so hard, but somewhere along the line they didn’t pick up that their work was straying from the concept of Sonic that most people recognised."
gaming,I usually base mine off of myself so no.
gaming,i like how everyone uses these pictures to say the movie is bad
gaming,"My friend has a theory that Nurse Joy and Officer Jenny are Pokémon. That's why so many identical ones with the same name show up all over the world and say the same things over and over.

That would mean like Mr. Mime and Jynx, they don't wear clothes - *that's their skin*"
gaming,I’m scared to ask what Knuckles looks like
gaming,"Not funny, this shit totally matches"
gaming,Mario already has his entry. It is a fantastic movie that I recommend everyone watch.
gaming,I still think female Ghostbusters holds that title. But this sure is close...
gaming,"If they wanted Sonic to look so realistic, then why did they keep those spikes on his back ? And they could have literally made him a hedgehog and named it Sonic... 😇😇😇😇😇"
gaming,"Just directly keeping the original smooth plastic cartoon look would've been worse, I think. It would be as visually plausible as a straight up Roger Rabbit/Space Jam overdrawing.

But all they needed was to let someone who understands proportions and such take a look at the character design and pencil in a few fixes. There's a lot of sketches floating around where people have taken ten minutes of Photoshop to the character and made him look way better, or even alright, while keeping a similar overall fuzzy pseudo-realistic look - the producers of this movie just .. didn't."
gaming,"But he was never based in reality. This uncanny valley creature is the result of some people trying to bring a blue anthropomorphic hedgehog into reality. You can’t make a face as abstract as sonic look like something from the real world. 

I feel like I’m not getting my point across but imagine if in that spongebob movie they gave him realistic sponge skin, realistic large eyes with sponge eyelids. His porous nose extraordinarily long like that of an old man."
gaming,"Feels like the opposite to me. Robotnik sounds like a generic evil scientist name, Eggman sounds like a quirky name that might make a few people giggle at first, followed by Eggman shutting them up by doing something evil."
gaming,Oh my poor sonic. I feel like I just watched my childhood dog get hit by a car.
gaming,"I'd bet the real guy is even crazier.. Apparantly he had alot of input on the movie hence why it is so ""artistic"""
gaming,Neill Blomkamp made District 9 with the leftover CG from the cancelled Halo movie.
gaming,Google his retirement date and tell me when was his last day... i'll be waiting mr misinformed
gaming,I'm just going to add that my one friebd came by with a VHS tape of donkey Kong and we bought the when it came out. Too young to beat it but man such a quality game. Link to the past was legendary. Too dumb to beat it and friends wouldn't lend it to me in fear I wish erase their file. Besides the midway wrestle mania game all the rest were shit and I found out the hard way by buying them.
gaming,"Could you give an example of a moment or two that seemed like trial and error or mechanics that seemed hidden?

You're still very early in the game and having no knowledge from other Zelda games will make some stiff seem more obtuse of course. But I think that most things are hinted at pretty well - not too blatant but you can figure them out without getting completely stuck anywhere. So getting through the game should be reasonably possible with persistence. OoT was my very first Zelda (very first console game at all actually) as well, back in 1999. And I remember struggling with bosses and at a single point in the water temple, which was fixed in the 3D version. (Not the one everyone complains about. I was stuck elsewhere. :D) But other than that, I always felt that the game guides you pretty well.

All of this doesn't apply to every little secret. There is some super obtuse stuff in OoT that you either look up or stumble upon by chance. But it's always optional things. Maybe you're just getting stuck on some of that?"
gaming,"They probably had most of the CGI done for Sonic, and said fuck it, we aren't wasting any more money on this shit, it'll flop regardless of how Sonic looks."
gaming,That red-white thing is a sign of Umbrella corporation from Resident Evil.
gaming,No he meant not. People aren't making fun of the trailer. They're bashing their heads on their tables asking why does Sonic look like furry fan fiction
gaming,This line gets me everytime lol
gaming,I wish Eggman was fat!
gaming,As much as I hate to admit it....this movie will still do well cause it was made for kids and not for those that grew up with Sonic. Parents who most likely aren't into gaming will be taking kids to see it.
gaming,If they change the look of the Sonic to the first one I will actually watch this movie
gaming,The teeth are little like a [demon's](https://imgur.com/ZJajWaK). That's what creeps me out.
gaming,"Which is sad, because some video game material could translate really well to film if they did take it seriously.

gaming,"Yup, you are right, direct from the image of the Box art/Cartridge art, my bad"
gaming,"I dare them to fuck up Kirby, though I'm sure they would anyway"
gaming,Watching everyone go full on CWC has been a pleasure.

gaming,sonic movie is better
gaming,"Hollywood tries to make every live action movie characters realistic, but they don't understand that the characters are loved so much only because they're unrealistic and fun.....😭😭😭😭😭"
gaming,The shot of Sonic getting ready to run and the lightning effects are straight out of the Flash TV show. The stopped time shot was like a half assed Quicksilver.
gaming,"They still have Miles to go, before they get the look down for CGI."
gaming,Just put your index finger over the top half of his face....

gaming,"You're not wrong, but they fused it so he is both now, rather than one replacing the other."
gaming,"This is what I don't get. Even if this was the result of a stubborn art director or something, you'd think they people supplying the funding would put pressure on a change once the public is horrified by the results."

gaming,Keep seeing the bottom Sonic picture and all I can hear is ungodly screeching.

gaming,They done a bad thing. They done a very bad bad thing. o lord they did
gaming,"Hopefully... it does look amazing and if I recall, they're getting their own voice actors for all the dialogue.

I just hope they add that one, where the woman wants to redo the line, exactly like it was in the original."
gaming,Konami doesn't give a shit about game development anymore. They are making more money with pachinko machines then they ever did making video games.
gaming,"The souls-like games are already easy, the only people who think they are hard are the stubborn dicks who refuse to learn mechanics or keep trying to ""fight fair"" I keep seeing people run through the whole game with one weapon that they upgrade and one suit of armor. As soon as a monster resistant to their one attack or strong to their armor shows up they are fucked. It's like playing Pokemon with only your starter and whining that the other guys get more Pokemon."
gaming,"Dr seuss characters at least look cuteish. This looks more like that creepy goofy cosplayer.

I was trying to stay positive til i saw the movie but oh boy!!! This trailer looks like crap. Production value like an episode of stargate."
gaming,"Yeah, I think the approach with adapting is often wrong. I know the Resident Evil movie series is really popular, but as a fan of the game(s), I think they’re atrocious and they’re based on .03% of material found in the series. Totally missed the point.

That being said, had Sonic been cuter and not looked like Chucky, no one would be dogging on it this hard."
gaming,You sure? Pretty sure the top is just a redraw of the scene with the modern game sonic unless that expression is lifted from a game
gaming,"This is not a term, explain yourself."

gaming,Maybe add the name so people know what you're talking about.
gaming,It did get a sequel.
gaming,"Support. Make it so, NetherRealm."
gaming,At this point I have to go see Sonic on release day just to reward the studio for the entertainment I got out of the reactions the trailer sparked across the internet. Definitely worth at least 2 hours of fun.
gaming,This is the only thing that can possibly make the film good
gaming,"Idk about that. Emoji Movie wasn't even 2 years ago and when it was announced people were already trashing on the concept. Sonic does get games pretty often and while reception is usually mixed, there have been some pretty good one's in recent years. I don't think the problem with the Sonic movie is that it's a movie about Sonic, it's just everything about the execution is horrible."
gaming,spend the half of my childhood doing this
gaming,I'm not sure where the character model came from.  Its hard to like.  But I feel for anyone working on this movie.  The grunts really loved the source material and grew up with sonic.
gaming,I've spun right around on this from horror to anticipation. Like sitting beside a busy road waiting for a crash with a bag of popcorn. Depraved and excited in equal measure.
gaming,"Yea, IMO this would’ve been better to just be a full animated movie. Or at least get his face right, like that literally doesn’t even look like sonic."
gaming,That's because OP just cropped the top banner from another post.
gaming,"That film is one of my guilty pleasures. It's stupid, it's cheesy, but the action is kinda fun and I like the scene where they use tidal wave sensors to locate the enemies movement. 

That and Thunderstruck + the USS Missouri = childish glee."
gaming,"This is clear progress of CG. A decade ago. Fur and hair was a CG budget killer. Now, let's fur all the things"
gaming,Has there been a response as to why the fuck they did that?
gaming,From the trailer I kinda see what they where going for in terms of story and comedic value but they choose the complete wrong visual art style for both the character and the overall film.
gaming,Cannot unsee. Just like I'm not gonna see this movie.
gaming,"It's my go-to chat if I lose, trying to fight through the tears, I'm happy for you guys..."

gaming,Are there no requirements as to who can be in a smash game? Like I thought the whole original idea of smash bros was to bring all Nintendo's IP's together in one game. Not just grab any character from anywhere. Like how Tf did persona 5's Joker get in there?
gaming,Stop hogging all the stupid
gaming,"His first appearance on a screen was 1980 with like 10 movies leading up to ace Ventura, the mask, and dumb and dumber coming out in 1994.  I was born in 89 and I feel like I grew up with his movies, and I presume someone born in 79 would say the same, how am I way off?"

I’d be surprised if they didn’t assess the reaction to the trailer and do a pretty major rework on his face."
gaming,"Not sure who made the character design, or where theyre from.  But odds are the new look is a result of too many test screens and demo targeting and people up top demanding the unreasonable."
gaming,"If you look into the story of it there’s a lot of serious manipulation from Triss to Geralt when he his mind was spaghetti’d.

gaming,Are you saying these aren't both masterpieces?
gaming,the biggest problem is that his mouth is properly in the center and not on the side
gaming,"The ending of ME3... Take out the entire citidel part and expand the ending to turn it into another suicide mission that plays out in multiple ways depending on how you played the game. 

Paragon Shep with full assets and a perfect paragon playthrough across the games you all team up and win the war and you get that epic but satisfying ending

Renegade Shep expends every resource and sacrafices anyone and anything to win, and maybe makes a choice that anhialates the reapers at the expense of everyone but the humans 

Multiple ways to fail, leading to Reaper victories"

gaming,Do you support Pauline Hanson?
gaming,"I loved the daytime levels in Unleashed. I don't think the nighttime levels were horrible, but it was just kinda weird to include them in a Sonic game, especially when it was the first 3D game with the boost mechanic. I hope one day they release a game that's purely that gameplay style. Generations was great, but an entire game dedicated to Modern Sonic would be amazing."

gaming,"""History repeats twice. The first time as Tragedy, the second as Farce"""
gaming,"You're probably right, but the biggest gripe between the two, is that Pokemon look like Pokemon, just CGI versions. Sonic up there though apparently deserved to be completely fucking slaughtered and a bunch of producers probably sat down during a meeting patting themselves on the back for it. It's a little haunting. If you're gonna make a movie about an unrealistic blue talking hedgehog that can run over 1000 mph, you should probably just settle with the fact that he is gonna look, well you guessed it, unrealistic. Sonic already has an iconic image and it's been pretty much the same since the beginning, why fuck that up? I mean shit I've seen plastic surgery addicts with better outcomes."
gaming,But who is walrus?
gaming,"I love SMB, it’s a typical movie for its time and even as a kid I didn’t mind it was different from the games.
I like most videogame adaptations anyway except for the Boll ones. MK and RE franchises are good shit."
gaming,I find any of the civilisations chilled but some might not
gaming,"My choices for the Gamecube ones were the one that didn't turn on, the Luigi's Mansion with the misconfigured analog so Luigi was always going left and SMASH BROS!!!!!"

gaming,"Sadly... Never made it far in Oblivion. I picked it up multiple times and started quite a few characters, but never made it past the arena and Kvatch. 

I have it now on PC, I modded it a while back but I  followed a lengthy guide and was pretty new to modding. Definitely buggered some things along the way. Very much looking forward to doing a vanilla+ minor mod overhaul and going through the stories."
gaming,From the trailer his acting looks just like reused bits from Ace Ventura.
gaming,I’m sold on that alone but I don’t want to give them money for they’re bullshit design but I wanna help Jim Carrey AHHH IM SO CONFLICTED
gaming,I'm not denying the design they went for looks more realistic. Of course it does. But I really wouldn't have a problem with a design that actually looks like Sonic and suspending my disbelief in a film where I'm already doing that with an animal that talks and moves at the speed of light.

gaming,Even when sega were publicly upset over the design they refused to change it I guess any game based movie are just doomed to be shit
gaming,"This text, with this picture, is so fucking perfect together that it's borderline creepy.

👀"
gaming,"You must be new to the Sonic fandom. That's kinda Sega's mo, they just kinda let their projects flounder until the last minute. Then they pay attention and are shocked once again that it's not perfect. Only reason mania did well is the people who worked on it were amazingly talented, used to managing themselves, and passionate."
gaming,"They are crazy about furries. They want to do like furry, what they just seen."
gaming,"That's a figure of speech. I don't get off my computer, drive to their house, and literally grasp for their throats when they forgot to call out their lane as MIA."
gaming,"Oh my God, it's gonna be the new MCU."
gaming,"DotA is in a good place. It is faster and the core game is still there.

Saying Valve is a shitty game developer is a pretty hot take my man, good for you. TF2? L4D? DoD? Artifact is the only truly bad game they made, the rest might just not suit your taste.

And yeah, the LoL competitive scene us great if you are in to the whole sterile MLB approach and can you know, actually stomach watching a game.

Edit: zero advertising? I guess they just put on TI because they are such nice guys."

gaming,Chunky because I have fat fingers
gaming,"I dunno, I can't say anything about the trailer/film because I'm too busy talking shit about the freaky design they gave Sonic. SMB had some extremely freaky adaptations, but at least it wasn't the main character(s), and not on literally every single trailer/poster/advertisement."

gaming,"Do you really think that many kids want to see a deformed Sonic who looks like a middle aged man in a furry outfit, come to earth, have the army be involved and do generic shit that's been done for years in other movies.

Or would they have preferred his design be more true to the original, and his movie take place in his own universe with the rest of the characters?... Because from what I've seen so far, even kids aren't a fan of this design."

(All Games as a Service, btw.)

Their art director must be such a fucking douche bag if he really wanted sonic to be how *he* imagines him.
God forbid, he must follow his artistic inspiration for the character."
gaming,"Shut the fuck up, Donny!"

gaming,"Games are in a unique position because they are interactive, where a player is an active participant in the action on-screen. This interactivity means that a variety of different players are going to take part in different ways, be it their preferred play style, their skill level and even things like freedom to enjoy the game in day-to-day life; all of which will have an impact on whether or not someone believes in the argument for an easy mode in a game like Sekiro or even the way some people view topics like microtransactions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I think the easy mode debate boils down to the type of game that's being created. From Software design games specifically to be challenging to the player, so adding an easy mode would pretty much defeat the point of their game as an artistic creation. The same way adding a ""skip"" button in a puzzle game defeats the point there. Sure it could be nice for those who just want to experience the story, but there are thousands of games out there which also have great stories to experience.  I personally wouldn't go watch a movie which I know isn't for me. Or read a book that I know I'm not going to  enjoy. The same way that I don't usually go out of my way to play games that aren't for me (sometimes I do for review purposes). Case in point, I haven't played From Software games other than the first Dark Souls because I don't really enjoy the type of challenge it provides, same way I don't play rage games. It's just not for me personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Would I like to play them to experience the worlds of these games etc? Yeah, I would and I probably will sit down and play through them to experience it at some point, probably gritting my teeth in frustration as I do. I don't expect or want them to change their vision for me though. They make games they want to make and they make them well, if those games aren't for me, well it's not like there isn't plenty of other titles for me to experience out there first.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think is the important discussion though, is accessibility options. Giving options to players to balance out the game for those who otherwise could not experience it, be it due to disability or whatever it may be, that is far more of a necessity in my eyes than creating easy modes for games which aren't designed to have them. Games are a great medium and making it so more people can experience them in the way they are meant to be experienced is a great thing that can and should be in developers minds. Letting a player experience a game like Sekiro or Souls at the difficulty of the average player, so they can make their own decision like the rest of us, is a better place to focus in my opinion."
gaming,The entire universe can be class as things that are or are not made of cheese
gaming,Is Deviant Art still a thing?!
gaming,"Into The Breach. One of my favorite strategy games of all time. From the makers of FTL: Faster Than Light (another great game). It's relatively simple, and turn based, so you can look away whenever you want. I find that it's really replayable though, despite its simplicity, and have sunk well over 80 hours into it. It's all about Mech vs. Kaiju combat, on a grid where you have to protect surrounding buildings and eventually take on the monsters hive. The story isn't overly elaborate and can generally be ignored. It's the game I play while watching Netflix or when bored in class, to keep my hands busy. It's also simple enough to run on a toaster, so you can play it on pretty much any computer made after 1995. 

You can also usually pick it up for pretty cheap, as it's full retail is like 15 bucks. Definitely worth it."
gaming,"For as much money marvel has, the way Ruffalo's head pokes out of his hulkbuster suit in infinity war looks extremely shitty."
gaming,"That’s still too much stress hahaha. But I like the concept of it and there’s a multiplayer mode, I might give it a try when it goes on sales, thanks!"
gaming,I view that movie as kind of an alt universe mario

Makes me wonder if any of them ever even played a Sonic game.  

""Boy that's weird. Lets give him two eyes instead. That way he doesn't look stupid."""
gaming,Could be worse... They could have a blue cgi will smith.
gaming,I love that the ONLY good Sonic game made in the last 25 years was made entirely by fans and not associated with Sega in any way except for IP.
gaming,In this situation I would flip a coin or buy both.
gaming,I will just wait the release of the film but my expectations aren't very high.

gaming,"I remember one of the McDonald's here in Fort Wayne, IN had Mario Party 5, &amp; I LOVED to go there &amp; play it.

I remember that I didn't play party mode being very young {I was like 5/6 in like 2006/2007}, but it had the full game of Mario Party 5.

I think those machines lasted at that location at least when I was at the end of 5th grade, so 2012? Yeah, I think so.

Mario Party to this day is still one of my favorite games. I had Mario Party 7 for quite a long time. It's one of, if not the most Nostalgic games to me. I played it all the time on my Gamecube when I was little.

If I'm also remembering this correctly, there was another 2 controller-ed screen thing next to this one, &amp; I can't remember if it was a copy of Mario Party 5, or another game. There may not of been a second one, but I think there was."

gaming,"It doesn’t mean redoing the whole movie, it means updating the visual effects model and re-rendering those scenes. I’m sure there’s more than that, but the practical video shooting, location and set work wouldn’t need redoing."
gaming,"Listen, they just applied some Loomis to Sonic"
gaming,"Seriously. I just want to hear from someone associated with the project. What in the pickled fuck is going on!? How has nobody anonymously come out and said ""it's hot diarrhea, everyone working on it hates it, I don't know why we're still going""."

Yes Animal Crossing is the type of calm game I’m looking for! But I don’t have any Nintendo console currently, if I get a Switch one day I’ll have a look, thanks!"
gaming,don't know what's the difference. I don't even know what keys are on my keyboard.
gaming,"That’s one of the problem. They added too much fur. Like none of the producer even bothered to google an actual image of a hedgehog. Sonic has no fur on his face, arm and belly bc neither are real hedgehogs."
gaming,how has no one done a sonichu version of this
gaming,Be glad he doesn't have a realistic looking gaint eye combined thing
gaming,"Honestly I’m ok with the looks now the story......not so much.
The trailer lost me at 2min. Mark the portal and Sonic knocking the bullets was too much for me.

I really don’t like the Comedic aspect of it and if he can slow down time without any kind of activation how the hell did he take a dart to the knee ?

He’s not that adventurer from Skyrim."

gaming,"While nice, I would have spent the money on a monitor and not an expensive keyboard."
gaming,"What did they fuck up? They made an anthropomorphic hedgehog, don't get what people are tripping out about."
gaming,"The more I look at it the more I realise they made his teeth look like that to try and match the more cartoony model instead of trying for realism.

God awful artists and modelers aside I’m realising that this is what happens when you try to create realism while trying to stay true to the original more cartoony aesthetic without having the money or talent to pull it off."
gaming,"Also: consider any animal with huge, broad shoulders.  Those are not fast animals.  Original sonic has more traits akin to very fast animals"
gaming,"I think the idea is that the face including lips is one part of the process with animations tied to the outside face parts while the mouth inside the model is sometimes made seperately. I imagine in some cases it's can be seen as the inside lining or ""bag"" part of the bag, with the lips where it is attached to (or not in some cases apparently) being the opening of the bag. It's a bag because its closed inside at the back of the mouth there is no full modeling of the entire digestive system from mouth to anus but the mouth itself is modeled create the illusion of a real mouth that goes somewhere."
gaming,"I truly don't understand why they had to change sonic so much, it doesn't even look like the sonic we know"
gaming,"Hold on, what if dr. Robotnik is behind this movie?"
gaming,Agree with ya' man.

gaming,"At the very end of the trailer I saw there’s a quick glimpse of him Jim appearing like Robotnic. So perhaps during the film he changes his appearance as he struggles against Sonic. Not sure about his weight though. 

Still, looks shitty."
gaming,"The night time stages are basically padding, because the normal Sonic levels are very expensive to produce and are over in minutes. That's why pretty much every 3D Sonic game has padding, or doesn't allow you to go fast. The one time they did padding right was in Generations, where they basically had a bunch of challenge levels that reused assets from the main levels."

Not that hard to grasp."
gaming,"That's how they canonized the name ""Eggman"" in the English dub of Sonic Adventure.        
The doc called himself Robotnik while Sonic insulted him with the nickname."
gaming,They should call that movie Sonic '06
gaming,i have touched all partly .
gaming,"As an adult, I still enjoy all these movies."
gaming,Ah Shit. Here we go again.
gaming,How could such an abomination make it this far in production without any of the people working On it realising how truly awful it is?
gaming,"I bought it two weeks ago because of this hahahaha. I hadn’t played it for years and the new flying monster that spawns at night scared the shit out of me at first lol. Yeah that’s the kind of game I’m looking for, thanks!"

gaming,Forward Unto Dawn was low key amazing.
gaming,Why isn't Ashton jumping out yet?
gaming,Thank you. I couldn't put my finger on who Sonic looks like and the kid from Jumanji when he turned into a monkey is it.   It's been bothering since I saw the trailer.
gaming,"The trailer is the absolute highest quality of bad the world has ever seen. 



Goes much further than Sonics design, you've got Jim Carrey attemping to be funny and failing harder than some amateur at open mic night. 



The acting from extras (sonic in bag scene) had more punch than any of the main cast.



And holy fucking shit the soundtrack! What kind of person looks at this trailer, a kids(?) comedy(?) movie and says, I know what's missing. Gangstas Paradise! 


It's equal parts Bad and WTF that I or anyone else in existence has ever witnessed. I genuinely can't tell if it's magnificent or pure misery."

But I'm not a massochist, so I'm not going to buy any of them."
gaming,You either die or live long enough to look like that.
gaming,"Why do reallife adaptations always have to be in fucking Paris, New York and/or San Francisco. They should release a Jim Carrey cut of this movie with everything but the shots with him in it cut out and shown and the rest of the movie burned."
gaming,Why did daisy look like peach
gaming,Who the fuck thought is going to be a great idea to give bottom lips. Painfull
gaming,Do you think it's possible they made him look stupid to gain more attention? Because it's definitely working.
gaming,"huh, guess i’m out of the loop, i don’t know who rod is. last time i played gears Cliff Blezinski was still “the man” lol. younger me would’ve been more excited but i’ll definitely check it out thanks!"
gaming,Da fuq is this pose...?
gaming,You either die innocent or live long enough to see Sonic live action movie
gaming,And you would think it can't get any worse but the acting is like a -10/10. Jim Carrey is an excellent actor. Idk maybe he's on some good shit or something because he is absolutely terrible as Dr. Eggman or whatever his name is. And James Marsden is excellent as Cyclops in X-Men but god damn he's awful here.
gaming,"If they had made the nighttime levels lesser in number and Knuckles instead of werehog, the game would be a masterpiece.

Call it, Sonic and Knuckles

*Oh wait*"
gaming,Somehow Sega managed to disfigure sonic worse than the fan base ever did and that saying something
gaming,"I had a talk at university from somebody who works at a CG studio that gets jobs from marvel (can’t remember the name sorry) and he talked about how the main studios (London, Singapore and America, Canada) still get a ton of work and how a lot of work is shifting to London because that’s also where a lot of movie filming is going (due to less taxes). Where’s this Indian animation farm sprung from? Seems ridiculous they’d send a massive budget Hollywood movie to some “farm” for cheap labour."
gaming,"The requirement is the franchise that they come from has to at one point had an entry on a Nintendo console. For instance cloud and joker when they were released hadn't been on Nintendo systems themselves, but FF and Persona have games on them so they're fair game."
gaming,Thank you kindly good sir
gaming,"Can someone please move the mouth to his left cheek?

gaming,"No not the platinum, I just really love that game"
gaming,What's that one movie with sonic against metal sonic. I loved that shit as a kid.
gaming,That's exactly what i thought the moment they announced this thing was gonna be live action. I wouldn't have been surprised if they'd called it Sonic Evolution as well.

And yet, almost every single male character has at least one pointless shot of them shirtless, and that scene always makes it into the trailer."
gaming,You already get 3 infinite ammo weapons. The one for beating Professional is the best damn gun in the game. Plus exploration wouldn't really work in a game like RE4.

gaming,Pikachu actually looks cool though. They've done a great job with the Pokemon universe. It actually looks like Pikachu. That is not Sonic though. You are delusional if you think that's Sonic. It has to be a alternate universe because that doesn't even remotely look like Sonic.
gaming,"It is done by the channel itself. It makes the video shareable only by link, so you can sort of control your  audience...I say ""sort of"" because you depend on the few people you share it with not spreading it."

And yeah, they do have *some* infinite ammo, but I don't want to go back through with just those, I want to be able to save ten guns with no need for ammo saving and just play around with them. I mean, I still go back and play RE4 all the time, but there's some fun to be had in just blowing ganados away all game with drastically OP weapons sometimes, which is a great feature in RE5."

gaming,"The ones doing the actual modeling probably werent the ones calling the shots. There were probably dozens of designs created by a lead artist that ranged in degrees of realism and likeness of the source material, which then had to be approved by some producer and ultimately the sponsors. Someone up top had the final say and fucked it up, resulting in this, and probably the eventual suicide of everyone on the crew who had to begrudgingly go with the flow and create this abomination of a movie."

gaming,"[Relevant IHE](https://youtu.be/Jtg6B5FfiDo) 

Turning a colorful cartoon character into an uber realistic cgi pissing contest is making hollywoo the money, but annoying us older folks."
gaming,"Having every gun be infinite ammo takes away the accomplished feeling of unlocking the bonus weapons. Even in RE2 remake, earning any infinite ammo gun is very rewarding because you earned it. That's what I don't like about 5, any gun is capable of being infinite ammo."
gaming,I did too.  But what you find funny is not necessarily the same as what everyone else finds funny so I don't know what to tell ya kiddo.

gaming,"Why wasn’t the movie a filly CG film? I just don’t understand the though processes here. Everyone knows how successful Animated films are. Even the bad ones make money. The Sonic films screams of someone who hates video games, and thinks that his ideas are superior to what would actually work. It’s embarrassing."

gaming,Removes graphics card completely... I ain't taking no chances.
gaming,Men too.  Being fit is the most important ingredient for attractiveness.
gaming,"I don't think it's needed.

For a point in attack power, you'll need 5 skill points. In a first playthrough, these skill points are gold to unlocking, you know, SKILLS! 

Also, during subsequent playthroughs, you'll be able to gather a lot more coin purses, which will make it easy for to buy the Dragon fragment that costs 5000 sen. 

So, for a first playthrough, don't bother with it, at least in my opinion. Focus on upgrading your skills and shinobi prosthetics, the increased attack power will come when defeating bosses."
gaming,It's horrifying. They butchered him so much.
gaming,"Well the “live action” Lion King movie is coming out and is almost entirely CGI, so I think we’re there"
gaming,Who would've known that taking a cartoon character with exaggerated proportions and anatomy and trying to make it realistic would be horrifying!?
gaming,"Because its an easier game, hence why CoD is so successful, its easy. Pros have beaten it multiple times, but its an AI lmao, they have 0 reaction time."
gaming,I would have been 100% fine with a normal looking sonic in a live action movie.
gaming,"He also is seen like liking his fir, getting electrocuted and the next shot they use in the trailer this. So maybe that has to do with it? Also maybe I shouldn't waste so much time and energy reading about this monstrosity."

If I were staring at a super evolved humanoid hedgehog, I'd at least want more realistic eyes looking back at me. Not some huge alien eyes...or single giant eye with two pupils. (Shit, he'd need eye drops 24/7 for those bad boy). This whole thing is so overblown and such a circle jerk, I swear. I've been a Sonic fan since I was a kid. There's far worse they could have done with the movie, and have done before in the video games. I know the pain of being a Sonic fan. This is not one of those times. Not yet, anyways. If the movie turns out to be garbage, that'll be because of the writing, acting, etc. Not because they didn't make him look almost exactly like he does in the video games. Christ..."

gaming,"The “Shin Megani Tensei” franchise has a long history on Nintendo, and Persona is actually a spin-off to said series that blew up. Cause Persona 5 is one: super popular, two: getting a spin off game on Switch, three: recent, Joker gets to be the representative of the entire franchise on Smash. It’s the same reason for Cloud, out of the 15 main FF games, the first 6 were on Nintendo, along with countless spin offs etc. FF 7 is considered the “best” Final Fantasy, and Cloud is it’s protagonist so he gets to be Final Fantasy’s face, as if they slapped Terra or Warrior of Light in there most people wouldn’t know who they are. 

Stuff like Snake, Mega-Man, PAC-Man all had games on Nintendo systems. Sonic games have been on Nintendo systems since the Game Boy Advanced after Sega stopped making consoles. 

Every single character in Smash has some sort of tie to Nintendo, either their franchise got their start during the NES/SNES era with Nintendo or they’re a arcade classic who’ve been appearing on Nintendo systems or they’re a newer franchise who’s made the jump to Nintendo (Bayonetta prime example, which 2 and 3 wouldn’t exist if it wasn’t for Nintendo footing the bill)"

I wouldn't put too much blame on Fowler if you dislike the concept. More likely than not, studio executives are strong-arming creative decisions and testing him on his execution of certain parts of the filmmaking process.

&amp;#x200B;

This movie is a means to a few ends:

* Give a new director and their team some real world experience on a large production before getting more autonomy
* $$$ Go nuts with movie tie-ins. advertising, promotional stuff, new sonic game, etc. $$$
* Act as a launchpad for training new people from all aspects of the business
* Jim Carrey gets to expand his estate (and all the power to him!)

&amp;#x200B;

What is strange, however, is the high budget and that he is also executive producer. Unless it's merely a contractual credit (which many in the industry are), having that much power on paper on your first feature is odd. Even George Lucas, the prodigal son of USC upon graduating still had to release THX 1138 and American Graffiti with a small budget before he was entrusted to do something like Star Wars ANH"

gaming,"It'd be wack to have him look like he does in like Sonic Adventure 2, too. I think they had the right idea with a sort of semi-cartoony pseudo-realistic compromise, but the execution was just terrible. 

There's a lot of hobbyist sketches around of how some random on Twitter would have done it, and most of them look a lot better just by tweaking the proportions a a bit, changing the shape of his arms and ears, etc."
gaming,"God I miss the sion damage on q and e. Or hell even old sion, he was a fucking treat to play"
gaming,Shit I didnt even consider those!
gaming,Isn't the game free to play?
gaming,Oh yeah sure just add me
gaming,Kaepora Gaebora the time wasting prick
gaming,That's funny. I used to work in CG on the east coast mainly and we called it a mouthsock.
gaming,That goomba design still beats this sonic.
gaming,"Have been creating models for about a decade now, but never heard that term either.

Edit:
But since we’re at it: This picture alone says a thousand words about the design you can expect. Just another poorly written and animated film to make some cash."
gaming,"If the art is bad, it doesn’t really matter if it’s what was in your heart. It’s still bad.

Hard pill to swallow."
gaming,gtx 1060/1070 with at least 6gb
gaming,"Nah I'm with you, I don't expect it'll be amazing or anything but it seems like a fun Jim Carrey movie that you shouldn't take too seriously."
gaming,I would say a geforce 1070 or vega 56 would be fine
gaming,Asteroid is coming to sort it all out. Relax
gaming,You say that...but i feel like there shoulda been no way for them to butcher their main character the way they did either yet here we are
gaming,I really hope it bombs and Hollywood learns something
gaming,"You can always connect the PC HDMI up with the TV. Or if you can afford to, have both the console and the PC and switch between them. You don’t need to game exclusively on one format all the time. I have a PC, Xbox One and a PS4 with VR. It’s good to be able to switch between them especially when my friends all play on different platforms and certain games are only available on single formats."
gaming,"Thanks! It's surprising little on code (or in this case, formulae)! There's a small bug I want to iron out before releasing, but I will definitely release as a learning tool for those interested, once it's looking good to go."
gaming,"Thanks, I hate it..."
gaming,"The whole change relies on governments rewiring the way that certain industries work. Unfortunately for the human race, those industries generate a tonne of money for those in charge and thus will never change.

Personally, I believe that traditional energy sources can quite easily be phased out with solar, wind and water farms, but many see these as an eye-sore. Until the younger generation get into positions of power, or we overthrow the underhanded right-wing backward greed filled thinking, we will unlikely see a change any time soon."
gaming,Nah Churchill was most definitely a PoS.
gaming,"Outside of Japan he was originally called Dr. Robotnik, but in Japan he was always called Eggman.  I think Sonic Adventures is when the West started calling him Eggman as well.  His last name is still Robotnik, but he is usually just referred to as Eggman."
gaming,Same here. Lie an uncanny valley cracked out ferret
gaming,He genuinely looks like a 3ft furry blue sex offender
gaming,It disturbs me more that 3D sonic has two separate eyes instead of one.
gaming,"Yes, I did switch to playing on consoles (in my case, Xbox 360), but that was when the only PC available to me was a Pentium 3 with a shitty graphics card that barely played YouTube videos.

From the sound of it, your rig can easily push most if not all games to run on native 4k, so I don't see why you'd even consider ditching it for a console... which outputs in upscaled 4k in a good day. What I'm getting at is, if you like graphics you really shouldn't even consider going to console. 

And if you could afford that kind of rig you currently have, you can probably afford a used Xbox One X and PS4 Pro."
gaming,Same way you did :o
gaming,"man.. imagine being the other player. you throw an axe, you're sure it will hit.

and this motherfucker blocks it with his sword, charging at you, fully plated."
gaming,"You’ll judge me even more if I tell you: I’m a Quinn player. Stormrazor made her way too strong and instead of nerfing the item they hit her again and then took the item away, _again_. It’s a reoccurring theme I guess. Even Vayne has a stronger earlygame in lane now :I"
gaming,This was one of my favourite movies
gaming,"You know, as surrealist art, I'm actually almost back on board with this depiction. 

All I can do is laugh at this point"
gaming,How is this still a thing
gaming,I guess that makes sense. The new games suck ass. But still the pic seems pretty irrelevant lmfao.
gaming,"I recently saw a real-life Goomba on a sub-reddit, scares the shit out of me!"
gaming,What the fuck did they actually use gangsters paradise in the trailer
gaming,Well I'm hard now. Thanks.
gaming,They're both fucking wack. Sonic is for level 100 autizmos
gaming,"Yes! Like he's been sleeping on Skid Row and been smoking and drinking.

So at the start of the movie he's the top image, but his wife leaves him, loses his best friend, etc., and temporarily becomes like the bottom image as he hits rock bottom."
gaming,I think Japan always called him Eggman.  It wasn't until Adentures on the Dreamcast that the West started calling him that as well.
gaming,Ok I’ll be that guy. Any film with sonic the hedgehog will be shit regardless of whether they get the CGI character right.
gaming,Its the same as the attempts at dbz.
gaming,"I think any sufficiently intelligent enough species that is not long lived (at least much longer than humans) is going to be hazardous to its environment.  


We have such short lifespans that a lot of us think ""oh well, not my problem"" it seems. If we lived to something like 2,000 years old I think we'd be a lot more individually conscious of our environmental impact."
gaming,I mean... now you’ve said that I kinda want it made just so I can see the disaster.
gaming,I am the very model of a scientist Salarian
gaming,this is so accurate smh
gaming, More like the depths of consumerist insanity.
gaming,I wish it was going to be like the woody woodpecker movie. Bad yet faithful.
gaming,"I know I always say I’ve never played FPS games and I suck at them, but I played ace of spades so much and was damn good with the m1/m14 carbine rifle."
gaming,Nicol Bolas stole his spark.
gaming,Why post here and not on r/sekiro ?
gaming,Product placement? I really don't wanna watch thr trailer again....
gaming,Sorry the Detective Pokemon movie disproves this
gaming,So back in the day is still now then
gaming,Damn I have the same one that is my childhood in a picture
gaming,Is Sonic sponsored by Puma??
gaming,"I chose Triss, and I woul 10/10 times!"
gaming,So THAT'S where I thought I saw him
gaming,Just buy a goddamn HDMI-Cable for your TV
gaming,"IDK, the internet is just weird. I just thought photos looked weird at first cause it was all leg. But I thought he looked fine in the video.

I just think everyone is over-reacting with ""sonic is dead/destroyed"" memes. I just don't see point in protesting a design, as if they'd change it or cancel it. I rather support it and hope the sequel fixes any issues."
gaming,"Hey, I'm far from being ignorant, believe me. 
The tattoo did fade a little, the color is less vibrant, but it definitely didn't smear.
Black ink tattoos also fade with time, but a lot less. I think that when any tattoo smears, it's probably the artist's fault (something about is the layer of skin where the ink goes?).
Look, I'm no expert, but I have a couple of tattoos from different artists, and I know a lot of tattooed people, so this is what I observe : most of the time, the ""life spam"" of the tattoo is more about the skill of the artist (and the emplacement) that if its watercolor/outlined/blacknwhite."
gaming,"*One of these things is not like the others. Which one is different, do you know?*"
gaming,Just like your limp dick is telling you: not a fucking chance
gaming,I switched for about 2 years when my kids were really young. Now that they're into pc games I've come back.
gaming,Can you make an working backup in Hardcore or is every progress lost?
gaming,Yeah this isn't remotely close to uncanny valley. This is just poor design.
gaming,"Wait, what if this is their plan all long i mean look at it they tried to kill sonic ages ago with their games. Now they will be putting the final nail in the corpse to kill sonic once and for all we all knew they fucked up cuz they couldn't release that trailer on first of April.
I wanna know what kind of shit they be smokin' when they said:""shit that's the model that looks like sonic"". And the guy that said"" you know gangsters paradise would fit perfectly"" with a character meant for kids."
gaming,Has nobody here seen forward unto dawn?
gaming,The new sonic looks like those monkeys from the original Jamanji movie.. anyone agree?
gaming,Wasn’t this battle pass free?

gaming,But the mario movie’s funny bad

gaming,"Oh, it's an watercolor peach, and a pretty realistic one. It's a shame I can't post photos on a comment."
gaming,"Someone asked ""what would an actual talking supersonic blue hedgehog look like in the real world?"""

gaming,Do you also pre order EA games?
gaming,This sounds like a less realistic proposition than when I heard about the recent Jumanji film.
gaming,"It does not look like a hedgehog *or* Sonic the Hedgehog.

I fail to see how it is possible to get something this wrong. 

He's basically one of the most famous video game characters in the history of everything, and everybody knows what he looks like. My mother, who is 64, knows what he looks like. There are probably monks in some distant temple on the top of a mountain somewhere who haven't moved more than half a mile in fifty years who know what he looks like. EVERYONE knows what he looks like. 

I mean at least get the fucking eyes right. Good grief. It's just embarassing. Like when your parents say ""I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed"". That's what this is. It's so far beyond annoying that it's just a flat-out disappointment."
gaming,"This fox taxidermy is by @Adelemorse on instagram. She's a really awesome artist, I highly suggest following. She recently managed to get her stoned fox home safe!"

gaming,I wanna spank her.
gaming,"Then do Amy, Shadow, and Big the Cat for a prequel trilogy"
gaming,"If you want an easy mode so you can experience the game then your not actually experiencing it. 

If you want an easy mode to see the story you can watch a lets play or read it up.

If you say you want an easy mode not for you but for those whose disabilities stop them from playing difficult games then shut the hell up because I saw a quadriplegic beat Sekiro and if he and others like him can do then anyone can.

This alone may make the movie worth it."
gaming,Your own damn fault for not staring at ciri’s butt the whole time.
gaming,"Naw naw naw! Detective Pikachu looks like a normal-ass Pikachu with life-like fur and realism, not an anthropomorphic electric rat.

This is not an attempt at making a live action Sonic the Hedgehog.. this is an attempt at taking something completely animal and throwing it into a humanoid form.. like a misshaped, Nike sporting, buff cosplayer wearing a bad taxidermy painted blue."
gaming,The teeth on the right one is the worst part.
gaming,don't be afraid to build it yourself - it's not as difficult as it seems. make sure you follow the instructions (of which there are TONS of out there) TO THE DOT! you'll be fine.
gaming,What an awful choice of music btw it's not fitting at all
gaming,"That would be a terrible idea, because by then nobody would be interested in this generic shitshow of a movie. People have already seen the trailer. Stealth changes won't have an effect on the people not bothering to watch it. Might convince some after some word of mouth maybe, but marketing-wise? Terrible move. But what the heck, from the trailer the design of the character is just 1 problem. The other being that this looks like Transformers, but with ""Sonic""."

gaming,"Lol, I've heard that a lot about different franchises. Including the star wars movies and Game of thrones. 

Why is it that this fans fuck it up so bad? Are they actually not fans?"
gaming,Really was the best times
gaming,"My reaction to the trailer: wtf? Wtf?! Hehe, Jim Carrey is hilarious. WTF?!?!?!"
gaming,"Jim Carrey already got the money for being in the movie. He's also a highly successful movie star. You shouldn't feel obligated to help him. If he is struggling, then because of bad lifestyle choices... that man should have been set for life 100 times over."
gaming,My 6 year old niece took no less than 5 minutes to pick Pikachu on the fighter select menu on Smash Ultimate.
gaming,"&gt; but in movies you can't play around. it has to look like sonic is there, and not just a crossover between cartoon reality and real reality.

Isn't Space Jam and Back in Action considered well done?  
Or what about Rocket Racoon, Howard the Duck style?"

Is this what it took for the Cubs to win? Who made that deal with the devil?"

The emoji movie cost $40 mil to produce, ended up making $217.8 mil in profit worldwide [(source)](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=theemojimovie.htm). Why the hell wouldn't they make it? They'd be stupid not to.

They’re too deep in the production for the movie that they are most certainly not going to do anything about it. I just can’t believe this is the design the producers ended up approving. It’s like they wanted to screw this up, that’s the only explanation I can think of.

I would wish failure upon this company and movie, but they really dragged my boy Jim Carey into this, I’d hate to see his career get ruined by this abomination they call Sonic. Too many mixed emotions..."

gaming,"Battle royales were a concept way before the Hunger Games. While it may have had a hand in popularizing it, it likely isn't the inspiration for all battle royale titles that came after. If anything the movie Battle Royale was a more heavy inspiration on most modern BR games."
gaming,Well fuck me. What a beautifully realised version of my nursery drawing of one of gaming's most beloved characters.
gaming,what a freaking awesome film
gaming,The movies that were made with large all black casts were also only marketed to black audiences. They weren’t budgeted as blockbusters and given the same wide releases as one.

You say that but critics didn't like Ace Ventura (both Pet Detective and When Nature Calls) and The Grinch (2000) while audiences loved them, which is basically what Carrey is channelling here as Robotnik."
gaming,Mario Bros is a fucking awesome film
gaming,Why is this sentence confusing me so much
gaming,"Whenever the premise is ""What if 'strange character not from the real world' was in the modern world?"" it's a clear sign the people making it have no idea what to do with the property.

gaming,"Exactly. They couldve gone as cartoonish as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, or even go 3D render a la Rocky And Bullwinkle live action flick. Sounds like Sonic isnt from earth anyhow based on dialogue in the trailer, so why does he need hyperrealism? Theyve created a monster, and its gonna burn one way or another."

gaming,"Many people use authorities as an excuse.But we can‘t wait for some dumb greedy politicians we gotta start on our own by eating less meat driving less etc.Sadly to really make the big steps we need the politicians.

I 100% agree with you it wouldn‘t even be that hard to switch to renewable energy sources it‘s just about the coal companies etc that fuck everything up by being greedy and selfish as fuck."

gaming,"Yep, Sonic the Comic and one of the novels covered this. It's the canon I was brought up with and stick to :)"
gaming,Nocturne maybe? He’s not really big though
gaming,"so, space jam is again this story about cartoon charactkers living in a cartoon town interacting with live action world and live action people. it is well done. your can enjoy the story, because the story is, they are cartoons. good. works. sonic does not live in a cartoon town. he is not supposed to be a cartoon. so you, the observer, are questioning why he DOES look like a cartoon.

rocket racoon is not a cartoon racoon. he is designed after an actual racoon and inserted into the movie. he looks real to you, and thus, you have no problem believing he is there.

if they would have given sonic a slightly more hedgehog look in the face, with tiny eyes and an actual hegdehog jar, it would have worked better.

think about it. original sonic doesn't have two eyeballs, he has one with two pupils. he doesn't have joints. his arms and legs are more snake like. in live action, you kinda have to follow basic zoology, or biology, or whatever. otherwise it's just a cartoon, in another movie, and you will not really get into it. current live action sonic just has a face noone can buy into, because it looks fake.

they tried to eat their cake and have it too, and now the fans are pissed

EDIT: accidently misgendered rocket racoon"
gaming,Yeah that’s the one
gaming,"It has been a while since I first published this book, and so it is about time that I updated it for a 2nd edition.

gaming,At least Pikachu looks like Pikachu and not some blue monstrosity
gaming,"Thanks for confirming, now I can sleep in peace ~"
gaming,Because that's how fucking good of a symbol/trademark/mascot  he is. They keep fucking him up and still he comes back.
gaming,"That's a mini series, and it's easier to pull those off in a competent manner than anything produced for a feature length Hollywood release."
gaming,Why is talking about someone being a man-child for wearing certain shirts a joke?
gaming,"That movie was also made in 1993, so apples and oranges. If they had the cgi and special effects we have today it would have been better. Sonic is a modern movie that looks terrible even comparing it to movies from 10 years ago."
gaming,Mortal. You dare underestimate the true power of a weeb. They can reach the greatest of heights to watch their favorite ~~harem~~ anime.
gaming,"Well said. I may be in the minority, but beyond the actual design, the movie kind of actually looks like fun. The voice actor seems to have a great voice for portraying sonic has the voice for the part. I didn't care for electric sonic though.

As far as carry goes, it seems like this is an origins sort of film as the end of the trailer has a more classic robotnik.

I am far from up to date on much sonic, mostly having just played the Genesis games, and gba, with sonic heros, and merely watching some of the various series on vhs rentals from blockbuster."
gaming,That being the case Sonic is gonna get destroyed by Kirby
gaming,He would make a nice blue hat
gaming,Here's hoping Ben Schwartz and the live-action cast can make the script work...
gaming,"Yeah, because Robotnik sounds so cool in comparison."
gaming,"Yes! 

But not as much as I hate the movies version of Eggman…"
gaming,You sound like my wife
gaming,I like the trailer overall but they really could’ve done him better
gaming,"Why do they think Hedgehogs//Sonic would be hairy? 

They are on their belly sure.. but the rest is spikes! Main reason it looks so off to me it seems he is furry all over with the hair gelled into spikes!?"
gaming,That looks really good.
gaming,I still have both of them on DVD.

gaming,"Yeah, it might be optional stuff then I guess.

Like the fact that builders complain about not getting food, but the lady making the food always says ""It's not ready yet."" 

And the Skull spiders also seem optional, but I have gathered enough for one of the guys to turn back to normal and he gave me a bigger bag for my rupees, which seems like it could help a lot, so I'll just search for them.

Also, 2 things. There are better equipment I can buy, but it's adult sized ? Do I just need to wait or is Ocarina of **time** like a literal thing and not just a name ?

And I have no idea who or where to give the fish to in the Zora place. There's a big fish guy, Lord Jabu I presume. But when I drop the fish on the platform or in the pond in front of him, it does nothing. He just keeps complaining about his princess or daughter or whatever."

I saw it in theaters when it came out and UGH."

gaming,Now he looks like someones uncle asking to borrow money.
gaming,"as much as i hate that this live action sonic movie is a thing, the design, while still terrible makes some sense to me, i mean its sonic in the real world, wouldn’t it be more jarring for there to be a hedgehog running round with one huge eye and two pupils?"

gaming,"Yeah I prefer playing from the couch using a controller on my 4k hdr tv, it's one of the reasons why i personally prefer console gaming rather than PC."

Where are the twists and stakes? If he loses,  he can try again.  So later, he loses his powers. But now if, he loses humanity will be destroyed.  The stakes are too high to allow failure. 

So at the start the worst he can get is a try again.  At the end he must win.  And since he was an immortal coward at the start a heroic sacrifice at the end is exactly what anyone who has any genre savy is gonna expect. 

No part of the film surprised me at all. No part of the film gave me a feeling of suspense.  No part of the film was immersive.  It was a very well done, by the numbers, film.  But one that left no impact on me nor is it one I'd go out of my way to watch again.  So,  I'd call it a C, maybe a B- if I was feeling kind."
gaming,"Ok, i'm a bit out of loop here, what in hell is that??"
gaming,Every. Single. Time. Then after 5 minutes you don’t know what happening and then you say “man this game sucks”
gaming,Guaranteed that a massive percentage of the people hating on this trailer will still go and see the movie. It's just bandwagon fodder atm.

That and my Uncle was the old man in the end of that movie playing Irish tunes on a Banjo.   


Ok may be it wasn't a classic."
gaming,......and now sonic just looks like a drunken fever dream
gaming,"ANY reason why this design was chosen is going to be bullshit. I don't care what anyone says. You cannot convince me that any test audience thought this looked better than a 'traditional' looking Sonic.

This is the same nonsense that was peddled when Bayformers came out. The 'old designs' apparently didn't look right when put into live action. Then Bumblebee comes along; the old designs got tweaked a little but the Transformers are at least recognisable rather than being walking piles junk (and it just so happens to be the best in the franchise)."

gaming,"I’ll probably watch it and cheer along, compared to half of the CGI movies it dont look half bad anyway. I just hope they call him Dr Robotnik and not Eggman, but I stopped playing Sonic after Sonic and Knuckles anyways lol"
gaming,Well that is America’s ass after all.
gaming,They are killing their own childhoods. Just suiciding the fuck out of them.
gaming,"I can imagine people enjoying them. Back in the days I was a spoiled kid with PC games and a SNES so the difference with these handheld games was huge. Regardless of that, the gameplay sucked anyway because I DID enjoy myself for hours with bootleg Tetris handheld games."
gaming,"What I want is a full movie with Jim Carrey as a crazy Doc Robotnik, even if we got a Sonic that looks like this.

Looking by the trailer, it will happen either at the near end of the movie or in the post-credit scene

A sequel on the other hand would start with Jim as a crazy Doc Robotnik. I will get a lot of hate for this, but I want this movie to generate enough money for them to make a sequel just so we can have Robotnik as Robotnik the whole movie. And let Sonic get a powerup that transform him into something that looks more like the fan edit."
gaming,"I believe you can do it by duplicating your save files, but in that case why play hardcore in the first place?"

gaming,Eggman collects the final chaos emerald and snaps his fingers...
gaming,I fully agree with this.
gaming,I didn’t catch the romantic undertones between Sonic and the princess until I played through the game again in University. 😂 It was not apparent to elementary-school me and thankfully did not furry-ize me.

gaming,"Cat In The Hat to Sonic : “You’re not just ugly, you’re stupid.”"
gaming,That was disproportionately disturbing.
gaming,Just like back then toys ruled animation
gaming,They could have composited the cartoon over live action like fuckin space jam and it would work better than this
gaming,An opinion??!!! No no no. We can't have that. Not in this day and age.
gaming,"If set this in its own universe (not bringing a human companion and the army into the mix very transformers like) with maybe dr robotnik stealing other animals having sonic to rescue them with maybe tales and have a buddy rescue movie i think that would of been awesome, but hey who knows maybe this will be good? (Probably not)"
gaming,"Never understand why people like picture toasters, you just slather it in peanutbutter anyway"
gaming,Why does Sonic have the space between his eyebrows and bottom of his eyes for bigger eyes? It's like they went with the right eyes at some point on that model.

This is what happened to Star Wars. Plus big studios that don't give a shit about the franchises taking decisions."
gaming,Soon we will stand invincible.
gaming,"&gt;They had to make a cartoon/game character look as realistic as possible

Which is 100% the problem. It should have been a cartoon for this very reason. I made a rant video expressing doubts regarding how freakish he's gonna look as soon as I found out the film was gonna be live action. Now here we are. The design of Sonic looks awful, and Robotnik likely won't look anything like Robotnik until the very end of the film, but I'm not gonna lie and say I think the plot seems awful. I'm looking forward to seeing this out of pure curiosity, plus I've been a Sonic fan all my life, no way am I gonna miss out when they finally make a film, even if they made the bone-headed decision to make it live action which led to this nightmarish ghoul of Sonic the Hedgehog existing.

Shameless plug, [here's my reaction to the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-vNyBt3QYo) for the curious."
gaming,Idk bout that but they might gotten a paycheck for this..... A small one. Maybe so small sanic was purposedly ... Nightmare-ified.
gaming,"It differs too far from the original design, the one, you know, millions of people know and love."
gaming,I would say minecraft was inspired by the hunger games books and film and these were inspired by the movie battle royal
gaming,I love the positive vibe Sonic gives off. Haven't seen anything like that on any other character.
gaming,"Ok? That's not really the point though. You just keep adding more stipulations. There needs to be an all black cast in a black actor-led superhero movie that is also a blockbuster? That's super specific for no reason. Also confused as to why you think a movie with an all black cast wouldn't be marketed towards a black audience, that's kind of just how advertising works. Literally anyone can go see the movies though. If black people are wanting an all black cast in a movie, why would it not be marketed predominantly towards black audiences? 

 Also, pretending a budget has any bearing on the quality of a movie is just ridiculous. Just for a recent example, Moonlight had a rather small budget of about $1.5-$4 million, yet made an amazing $65.2 million at the box office. It also was nominated for 8 Oscar's and won 3 (Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Supporting Actor). That's absolutely amazing and it's a film with a large black cast that deals greatly with a black man's unique life experiences as he grows up. Why does it need a massive budget to be considered important or successful for you? 

For a black-led superhero movie, the Blade trilogy cost $45 million, $55 million, and $65 million respectively. Those are massive budgets, especially for their time, and the series had the ability to be one of the first large budget comic book movies with Blade coming out way back in 1998. They were absolutely popular with a large, diverse audience and paved the way for the rest of superhero films. 

Not really sure what you mean about availability, as pretty much any large black cast film I've seen has been readily available for viewing. With the rise of movie streaming, people don't even have to leave their home and have a larger variety of movies to see. I feel like you just looking for problems for no legitimate reason."
gaming,Omg the bottom Sonic isn’t a real thing going on is it??? Please tell me it’s a joke. And then destroy it
gaming,"Fair, good point, i entirely forgot it wasnt always lumped into one movie format"
gaming,"And it was far more acceptable that way. Keep them sticks I’d prefer it to tiny buff human legs. 

Edit: his feet are also too small. They buffed up his legs and gave him smaller human feet. They tried to go too human with those legs and it looks so odd."
gaming,"That Sonic on the bottom does spark something


It's spark of disgust and fear."
gaming,I disapprove of this
gaming,"They were talking about making a Halo movie in like 2004 or 2005, long before District 9."
gaming,"1. Define irreversible... like with current technology or is there some physical limit to mass of greenhouse gasses removed from air per unit time?


2. How would &lt; $1B make any significant change in climate change? Who would it be donated to? What makes you think that $1B will be the tipping point on a multi-trillion $ issue? 


3. Wtf does the plastic/fish thing even mean? More pieces of plastic than individyal fish? More mass in plastic than biomass of fish? What do u count as fish? What do u count as plastic?

I agree with ur message that climate change is a serious issue, but posts like this just make it really hard to have reasonable conversations about it, and IMO do much more harm than good by spreading poor or misleading information without backing any of it up with sources or context."
gaming,"I can share some insights on this one.

I had two Headsets for my PS4: Turtle Beach XP510 and the current Playstation Platinum Headset (both are wireless)

The Turtle Beach had a dedicated receiver Box and needed to be connected to the controller for the mic to work. Because reasons (Bluetooth).
Apart from that connection cable breaking twice over two years, this was a fine headset. Not the most comfortable during very long gaming sessions (&gt;5h).
I switched to the Platinum Headset after the Turtle Beach startend to show some other age related isses.

The Platinum Headset uses a USB Dongle for connection. Obviously there are certain benefits in using the Playstation stuff like virtual surround sound profiles and so on.

The earcups are very comfortable even after several hours, but the rubber headband is somewhat annoying.

The main reason I might not reccomend the Platinum Headset is the fact that some models (mine included) have a problem with the wires in the left earcup. Sometimes the left one doesn't work at all. There are three somewhat well documented fixes for this. Restoring the firmware through the Playstation app (takes time, no lasting fix), pushing the left earcup against your head while wearing (works everytime for me and takes only a few seconds) and taking the headset apart and fix the wiring yourself. Mine is out of guarantee so I didn't bother sending it back.

Sorry I can not fully recommend a headset for you, but maybe my experiences can help you avoid some pitfalls."
gaming,Why sonic so scary
gaming,Surprised-sonic-face.jpg gonna be memed
gaming,"So its all made digitally, cant they just swap out the character model?"
gaming,"I've used this line before.  Also have used ""If I was still single"".  Basically quick way to say ""Yeah thats cool, but I don't have time like that anymore"" to people.  Like I have a coworker who says he spends $500+ a year on steam games.  I'm perfectly happy for him, but I can't afford that type of investment money wise or time wise.  

Which is why my gaming PC is now 7+ years old and still running SLI'd GTS250s.  I did finally pickup a Xbox one - day one edition for $30 on eBay though and got around to softmodding my original xbox.

Once you get kids/spouse you should/have to consider them over your own time preferences.  Even with a full time job I could still manage 6-8 hours gaming after work when I was single...  AKA didn't have a family.  Once I got married that was down to 2 hours a night.  Then dwindled to 2-3 hours once per week after a few years.  Once kids came along dwindled to much less maybe 30 minutes to an hour per week, unless I play games with them too or I miss out on sleep.

Then throw in house projects and car maintenance free time quickly goes away."
gaming,Gotta find and destroy the nearby crystals but by now ur times gonna be way too slow
gaming,Gamers are very sensitive bunch
gaming,"Holy shit balls, they’re coming out with a sonic movie now? When did this happen"
gaming,"Some of that is actually not even optional, but fluff. Just some things to make the world seem more alive.

And you don't have to literally wait for Link to grow up. There is a point in the story where this will make sense. (BTW I'm completely amazed that you managed to stay so spoiler free for some of the main plot points. Congratulations, it's much cooler to find out about these things during a playthrough.)

The spider people reward you for every 10 spiders for a while. These rewards are worth it. There is another reward for finding all spiders in the game. Finding all of them falls in the super obtuse category I mentioned. And the ingame reward is not worth it. It's mainly for completionists.

The zora guy you describe isn't Jabu-Jabu, but King Zora. You have to find out what happened to his daughter. Exploring the world and talking to people will definitely help here. The info you're looking for is not in Zora's Domain, but in the domain is a shortcut to where you'll need to go.

I hope these hints help you out some. I'm trying not to spoil anything. But if you need/want more explicit help, just say so. :)"

It could be argued that you have to separate the artist from the art , when you watch a film or something like that. 

I'm sure that in the crew of any film there's at least one person who's done bad things at some point in time. Is it fair to disregard the hard work put into the film by all the rest of the cast + crew, purely due to personal actions of someone who was involved?"

First you get everyone to talk about the movie (negatively), but making everyone aware of it. And then the positive surprise that it was just an elaborated joke and that the movie itself has a good looking one: doubled buzz, this time positively.

And it wouldnt be techincally that impossible to do. Just a few scenes to re-render with that hillarously deformed version of Sonic for the trailers and teasers."

gaming,"Its pretty amazing how Sonic's design was so critical to its success and when they make a movie, they change it into something that would have made the game a flop 29 years ago, earning no movies."
gaming,What would you put instead?
gaming,I'm all for the SSBCU just to see Pikachu kick the crap outta that Sonic
gaming,He looks like the [monkey kid from Jumanji](https://www.google.com/search?q=kid+from+jumanji+monkey&amp;safe=off&amp;client=ms-unknown&amp;prmd=ivn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi6mM_-iPrhAhXMUxUIHYe7CD8Q_AUoAXoECAsQAQ&amp;biw=455&amp;bih=823).
gaming,"I think you missed something. If he wasn't blue, I would have no trouble recognizing him. I would then be complaining that he's not blue. I'm struggling to find the logic in your argument."
gaming,Just use flint and steel
gaming,Bro fr I think I'm a furry now
gaming,"Reeeeepoooosted thousands of times,smh"
gaming,"Take your time. Find attack patterns, don't get greedy trying to fit in attacks. Dark Souls needs you to dodge and block attacks just as much as to hit back. Don't rush yourself.

If they're big, *stay close to them.* Sounds counterintuitive, but it works most of the time."
gaming,"It always makes me wonder when something like this happens, that not one person in that department said ""hmmm maybe we should change the style of sonic.... I'm having nightmares, guys"""
gaming,Reminds me of Oblivion
gaming,"Who are you, exactly?"
gaming,My heart beats for cyclops. He was so close to greatness
gaming,Omg that was nice
gaming,"I wondered how long it would take for one of you to show up. Did you hear ""a lefty is expressing their liberal opinion on the web, you must away with haste to wave your righty flag!"", on the wind and come a-running?"
gaming,...Do you think Mr. Mime was supposed to be furry and not be creepy?
gaming,I was surprised to see Jim Carrey in it.
gaming,"Illumination (Despicable Me, Minions) is doing an animated Mario movie. Not sure when it's coming out though."
gaming,"Yes but playing multiplayer games on PC using a controller against m&amp;K players (and hackers) will be putting yourself at a strong disadvantage, this along with the fact that the vast majority of PC exclusives are m&amp;k games means that if you prefer playing from the couch with a controller then you are better off on console. Also HDR is not as well supported on PC as it is on console."
gaming,I love that movie. Such a mind fuck.
gaming,"That ain't Tails no more bro, that's Foxy possessing his body now. Jeezus."
gaming,they could've used werehog without the claws and it would be perfect.
gaming,They are trolling us.
gaming,"&gt; Millions of people like it

gaming,It's like the new ssj transformation from DB super
gaming,"I don't think it's what makes it creepy though, Sonic also has teeth.

What hit me the most seeing this is the actual similarities, except for the eyes.


A [very bad photoshop](https://i.imgur.com/wGs1YxX.jpg) can almost make it bearable to me."
gaming,"i think the cartoon ""cars"" had the same kind of eyes, and it looked fine"
gaming,"I guess that's the big point, yeah. It would've exploded way more if they just announed a new cross-platform game. Still it is surprising to hear \*anything\* from Valve at this point"
gaming,Angels with Scaley wings
gaming,It's a remake of the OG Xbox Duke controller.
gaming,“Delightfully hairy. Perfectly lumpy”
gaming,90% of people who watch anime pirate them anyways.
gaming,Well you have to remember with Sony the vr scene has really taken off in the past 2 years so I think that the PS5 will be built more towards vr  but that's just my opinion
gaming,"Admit it, you use this more for porn than you do for playing video games."
gaming,"You need a ""Sonic"" prequel first.. what Paramount did is ""Eggman vs a blue homunculus, the movie"""

gaming,The one made by hyperkin?

gaming,I thought Subnautica had an end? Isn't the idea of the game to build a rocket as a way off the planet?
gaming,did this woman really say this like in what sort of context does this make sense in a commercial video
gaming,We can only hope it looks this good.
gaming,How would that work when the main character is a mute?
gaming,I’m just gonna sort comments by controversial to see if anyone else likes it
gaming,At least it makes sense for detective pikachu to look like that but not sonic
gaming,The bad thing about being faster than light is that you can only live in darkness
gaming,Yeah they just talked out their ass. That's as stupid as saying that foxconn was designing the iPhone.
gaming,"Happy cake day! 

The portal is a lie."
gaming,"Isn't that kinda the same thing though? Can't we have an adult debate on both our of opinions? If you ask me, that's what's lacking. Too much of ""I'm right!"", ""No! I'm right."" And nothing ever changes. It's a constant stalemate. Maybe if the two sides discussed instead of insisting that they're wrong or ""dumb"", things may change for the better."
gaming,"It doesn’t look that bad, though."
gaming,"With just a tiny, wee detail that Mario movie is 26 years old.

That was 26 years ago, which gives a little bit of time to learn from someone's mistakes.

Also, almost everyone who posts this bullshit, knows nothing about real reasons of movie's failure. But if you want to learn watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve26GpPDTgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve26GpPDTgY)"

gaming,Google says the movies budget is 90 mil. That's a big yikes.
gaming,Tomb Raider movies are decent. Watched the latest one 3 months ago but couldn't tell you the plot was rather forgettable. I remember the rusty plane in the river.
gaming,My sister and I have this theory that you can tell people are evil just by looking at their teeth. This version of sonic is definitely evil.
gaming,"Thanks so much for all your input mate. I've had some things spoil for me, albeit minor things, like the time I thought the game was glitched with the chicken that got stuck in the crate.

I feel the same way about spoiling a game, that's why I'd rather post here than search online and have all the answers. It's much more satisfying and rewarding discovering things on your own."
gaming,Probably the younger kids that the newer sonic games caters too.
gaming,Why he has human skull? HES A FUCKING HEDGEHOG
gaming,"Not at all for me. But the time you’re able to spend gaming is greatly reduced. 

If I have a day to myself I will always spend as much time as possible on my Xbox"

Edit: words"
gaming,"I'm 21 now - for a time after high school (UK) I found gaming boring and frustrating as I was too tired from working in a full time apprenticeship.

gaming,"Same here, but I don't have even that time anymore. It's my fault though I guess."
gaming,"I do game less but it's more because of the fact that there are barely any games coming out these days. I spent my childhood with games like Dragon Age, Neverwinter Nights, Mass Effect, Fable, games with big storylines and charming characters. These days it's all about microtransactions. ""Games are getting too big for a storyline"" shit and ""Games as a service"". So I'm losing interest not because of my age but because of the age of gaming."
gaming,"*""We'll show them Bro's Smashing""*"

gaming,"I actually really like Sonic Adventure 2. I played hundreds of if not over a thousand hours of it as a kid, and I still come back to it as an adult.

However, since I have played it so much, I've realized that many of the basic gameplay loops aren't really that good.

At least the mech and treasure hunting levels are perfectly functional, which is more than you can say about some sonic games.

Is it a good game? Yes. But a great game? I'd say probably not, but it could easily be enjoyed that much."

gaming,He look like a teletubbie
gaming,"before we answer that question, do you have any medical complications we should be aware of? 🤔"
gaming,"1. The animators aren’t trash. That’s like calling a construction worker trash because you don’t like the design of a building. They didn’t make the plans, they just built it.

gaming,"""Do a barrel roll"" has a new meaning"
gaming,"I mean, that first model looks like it would stick out like a sore thumb in the real world. If looks like something we'd get from the people behind the Rocky and Bullwinkle movie.

My guess is also that Sonic isn't actually going to be from another dimension in this movie, but actually a mutated/experimented hedgehog, hence the shift to try and make him ""realistic""."

gaming,"Why? Bc of dysphoria, a deep and fucking terrible depression at the prospect of being, and being viewed as, our assigned gender. It’s caused by an inherent disconnect between our brains (which are constructed to conform with our actual gender) and the rest of our body. Being treated like our assigned gender rather than our actual one is actually really distressing, as is the prevailing narrative of trans women in particular as either bad cross dressers, rapists or “traps”. On the other hand, getting corrective treatment like hormone therapy pretty much fixes all our problems, as does getting treated like our actual gender. (Of course this is a simplification and it’s more complex than that but still, that’s the basic idea)"
gaming,And it seems to be coming from you
gaming,"Yah... I think I made a mistake... Vaguely generalised...
May be... Those who enjoyed childhood even after their teenage too... Included..."
gaming,Say what you want about Sonic but Jim Carey as Dr Eggman is spectacular. I will watch this just for him.

gaming,but why is sonic furry when he should be quill-y?

gaming,"&gt; i dont think she is trying to say that everyone that picks up a shooter can and will shoot someone.
&gt; 
&gt; i think that what she is trying to say is that someone who can and will shoot someone, can learn how to operate a weapon (at least on a basic level) by playing shooters

you clearly forgot about the comment you were replying...and also have no idea of the effect media has in people. 

You seem to imply, like most people who get this wrong, that watching violence seems to enrage a person into a rampage. this is the plot for ""the incredibles 2"" with the screens transmiting hipno waves and wtv...its bullshit...

What actually happens is that violent games make people numb to other people pain. like i stated earlier, people loose focus on whats real and whats not, and after killing so many people in game, killing someone else doesn't seem that long of a step. add some real source of rage and frustration, like bullying or home problems, and it will drive someone into some real dark places like depression of violent acting.

gaming,"I looked into EVE, actually, and just had no idea how to find a role and wasn't interested in trying to go on some solo space adventure. You need someone to just collect stuff? My interest is piqued."
gaming,"Arlo said this in his video but I’ll roughly echo it here.

These guys knew exactly what they were doing. It’s nothing but a quick cash grab with shakily thrown in references to make it seem like they care. Using this weird sonic model creates controversy (free marketing) and makes them more money if people see it “for the laughs” over using an actual sonic model which would create less controversy and therefore less views, so less money.

They did this on purpose."
gaming,There have been plenty of films with this exact premise
gaming,Pikachu irl is kinda creepy. Sonic irl gives me nightmares.

gaming,"Which is a system that would work perfectly if there were jobs that you could do readily available at all times or, at the very least, the time that you're considering leaving for another job. That is unfortunately not how the world works.

&amp;#x200B;

If the two options were between working a job that makes you unhappy and unemployment, what exactly are you expecting people to do? Additionally, why shouldn't people advocate for better working conditions? They're not asking for perfect, they're asking for not shitty."
gaming,"Oh yes , thought you were the same user. Sorry.

Yeah that's fair, I mean sonic doesn't exactly look like the next Pulp Fiction , so I'm not that interested either 😂

That's a really interesting observation - for example Robin Williams' depression was manifested outwards into humour to a certain degree. 

Hollywood stars who are bad people (like Carrey, arguably) should not be held up as paragons of goodness by the public just because people like their acting. But I guess that's how celebrity culture works :("
gaming,I would recommend this to every person I ever encounter if they throw in a gross people teeth Tails at the end complete with spinning tails that your brain is incapable of understanding in a realistic setting so every time you look at it you just feel sick and like the walls of reality are collapsing around you.
gaming,Sonic's always got blue balls.
gaming,"No problem, it’s pretty simple to begin with but it can get complicated, they do a phone/tablet version which is a simplified version if you want to take a look at that"
gaming,"I’m just wondering why they decided to go for the smallest eyes ever on Sonic. Plus the furry arms, like why?"
gaming,And yet somehow it doesn't look worse than it already does. Actual movie Sonic looks so bad that a bad edit doesn't look worse. Just different.
gaming,"Does anyone actually mean it though? 

It’s either done as basic etiquette because you have to without meaning it or you’re doing it because it’s seen as mocking."
gaming,"Ezra Miller as Link, Margot Robbie as Zelda, Willem DeFoe as Ganondorf, who then transforms at the end into CGI Ganon."
gaming,and i disliked the 2d parts of generations. it has nothing to do with good. you just arent a fan of the modern sonic gameplay. you can have your fun when they make mania 2 and ill have my fun when they make the next 3d game.
gaming,If you're to make a Sonic movie make it fully animated or just don't fucking make it.
gaming,Just put him out of his misery and kill him
gaming,"Carrey was killing it in the trailer. I miss that old school Ace Ventura comedy, but the blue rodent hurts my soul."
gaming,Fur suit sonic has more furry meme potential
gaming,"No, this is Patrick"
gaming,"Normally works, Normally works!"
gaming,Me too never heard.

gaming,The ever elusive mute button.
gaming,It really depends on how vulgar you want to get
gaming,I'm starting to imagine that how knuckles is gonna look like
gaming,"Hmmm, in my case it was the opposite. With a successful career in the oil field, family, living and different countries, etc. Gaming has been awsome with support from my wife and kids. The more money I make the better PC/home gaming office. Gaming has been a great stress release for me, and will always be something I enjoy doing on the side. Key to it all is having a supportive wife, mine realized that I was much better off at home enjoying gaming with friends online rather than being out of the house from 5am until well after  noon playing golf and drinking every other day, getting into trouble. Some of the games I enjoy are Milsims, DCS (have learnt to fly several planes) and currently playing TD2. Another thing to take into account is the group/clan members I have become great friends with over the past 10 years, we are brothers."
gaming,"Crap, for some reason I thought you meant in EVE, I don't have 76."
gaming,"Screw you, I loved that movie as a kid"
gaming,It's hard to hear you from the bottom of the score board.

gaming,They literally just had to copy it...
gaming,*your character in the in-game cutscenes*
gaming,This is the equivalent of Tien  Mr Popo and Radditz having a spinoff show...
gaming,"Basically. There are good 'realistic' conversions, and bad realistic conversion. Sonic's beyond ugly.

gaming,The second one sparks fear.
gaming,"Or intimidate them by using the memes created when she was inducted into Smash Bros.

My favourites are; “I’ll help make you fit...into a coffin.” Or “Your ideal heart rate is zero”

There are a lot more zany memes out there of hers."

gaming,Animaniacs was such a good show!

gaming,At least you would die after 10 minutes were up
gaming,"Yeah, I eventually learned this... Probably took me way too long, and even after I carried on mashing A.

Old habits die hard."
gaming,"I will say this, I live near Montreal, there are a couple of McDonald's nearby, one of them has that gigantic playground for kids to slide and shit, but beside that they have this beautiful row of N64 and Gamecube consoles. Literally last week I checked it out and they were running Mario Kart 64 and Double Dash, Super Smash Bros Melee, and Sonic Adventure 2. 2 of the N64 consoles weren't turned on so I'm not sure what could have been on them. But it was a magical sight to behold."
gaming,"Neither of those fucking abominations will ever spark joy, ever."
gaming,I respect your conviction.
gaming,I can't wait to find out who the lead artist is and tell them they ruined my childhood
gaming,It's OK to take a break. I experienced stretches of 3-4 months of watching letsplays on youtube or just watching twitch until something worth playing came about.
gaming,Did he save you?
gaming,"I came across to a few yesterday while playing OW and acted like I never seen one before in IRL. I was just entertaining myself but those people were friendlier than most of the OW community.

We need more women to play games"
gaming,We have strayed far from god's light.
gaming,"The thing I always hated about Spawn was he's just if Venom and Ghost Rider had a baby.  And Todd McFarlane was on both the Venom team and GR team before leaving Marvel.  So as cool as Spawn was, it always felt like a ripoff of to me.

Also, I'm still sad about how Venom and GR have been treated in movies.  Just utter garbage.  Spawn movie was pretty good."
gaming,"Why would you need to compare it to anything else?

Its a movie.

I mean the whole Marvel cinematic Universe is shit when compared to the original stories but you're not suposed to compare them, you're supposed to enjoy them for what they are.

Lets not pretend the Silent hill game had some award winning writing either lol"
gaming,Jim Carrey would have been a better Sonic as well I think. The fuck were they thinking
gaming,Wow. That's way WAY fucking better.
gaming,"I’m really sorry for not replying yesterday. And i’ve already tried out other games but they were all mainly fps, i’ll be sure to try out binding of isaac since it’s always looks fun :))"
gaming,I'm gonna need a source for that for research purposes.
gaming,"I have the same thing I can't play any new games. I remember 4 years ago I was playing so many competitive games with my friends. We used to play csgo Dota2 lol and it was so good.
And now I sit down in front of the computer and there is nothing to play."
gaming,"They should cancel the realease and redo the c
CGI"
gaming,Somebody explain to me what the fuck I am looking at!?
gaming,Is that the Werehog? wth
gaming,More for me. It’s easier to access than other hobbies so you can do it in an evening when your kids in bed etc. Plus its a lot cheaper and kids can do it too. So for me its a growing interest
gaming,Both of those terrible nightmare abominations only spark fear and dread
gaming,honestly the fan made one is better
gaming,"I never understood the beef with GFWL. To be fair, the only game I owned that used it was Fallout 3, and I liked it because it gave me more achievements."
gaming,never even saw this
gaming,"I know I suck, the only thing that sucks more your mom when it's payday"
gaming,No it looks like a freak in a fursuit instead.
gaming,Basically almost every live action adaptation of a supposed cartoon/animated/2d franchise nowadays.
gaming,Doctor Robotnic is his damn family name dammit.
gaming,Why the hell does everybody call him dr Eggman no one called him that in the 90s it was Dr. Robotnick.
gaming,"That's true. But who cares, doesn't really mean anything"
gaming,"If you can’t come up with something yourself, I wouldn’t bother saying anything at all."
gaming,I've maybe played sonic two times decades ago and even I know this is true.
gaming,"Kill it, kill it with fire"
gaming,Why is one eye pulling a Jay-Z in the thumbnail?
gaming,I'm fascinated  by the question as well. Cause this is a genuinely baffling decision that multiple people needed to sign off on. How the fuck did that abomination wind up as the Sonic?
gaming,Well i want the next one to me Metroid with Samus.
gaming,"They also didn't have to make him look realistic. That's thinking from 20 years ago. The biggest movie opening in history involved a talking racooon* sad because of his tree dying. 

The Pokemon movie understood this. Audiences are more than willing to grant you a weird premise if you *actually make a good movie*.

Edit- Before anyone objects, that isn't a spoiler. At best it's an IW spoiler.

Edit- Wow. No idea why I typed that"
gaming,"Unless it becomes the next 'Deadpool' and I'm not saying that just because Reynolds is in both. But if its as popular, which I think it can be regardless of its quality as a movie, then it can make the director into a pretty big deal."
gaming,I struggle to keep my right eye open
gaming,SIGGRAPH (arguably the most prestigious graphics conference in CS) used to be held in Vancouver in alternating years up until 2018. The graphics research group at UBC is one of the strongest in the world.
gaming,I always thought of it as Dr. Robotnik as being his real name but Eggman being a nickname that Sonic and his buddies had given him after being tormented him for years
gaming,I fucking knew that looked familiar
gaming,Why does the movie even exist in any form in the first place?
gaming,"Hedgehogs have those too you know. They just aren’t called quills. 

Quills are hollow and barbed. Hedgehogs have what are called “spines” which are like long hard spiked hairs."
gaming,"Jim Carrey does NOT make it redeamable, only fit for 10-12 year olds ... wouldnt be surprised if the move was full of fart jokes"
gaming,"Yes, thank you. It would be so much nicer if it was the regular design, but with more realistic lighting and fur rendering, ala Roger Rabbit. Instead, we got a Sonic designed by Deviantartists."
gaming,Ignoring them. They feed off your reaction
gaming,is your name a jojo reference by any chance jotaro?
gaming,"Its ok bro, stay strong."
gaming,childhood favs that do hold up?  1986 Transformers and the first two Ninja Turtle Movies (particularly the first one).
gaming,"Maybe, but might just be your taste is different than the general population too."
gaming,It looks like they designed the character using knockoff plushies as their inspiration.
gaming,"Here is the post credit (not real):

Pikachu chilling out, drinking coffee. When suddenly, Masahiro Sakurai (the creator of Super Smash Bros.) opens the door.

“You think you’re the only hero in this world? Pikachu , you've become part of a bigger universe, you just don't know it yet” Sakurai says.

“Who are you?” Pikachu asks

“I’m here to talk to you about the *Smash initiative*”...

Cuts to black"

Most douche bro’s are terrified of the gay since they’re usually in the closet. You’ll never hear from him again"

Nice post OP haha"
gaming,"Best way to massacre any character. Give them a voice when they originally never did.

Exhibits a and b: Zelda CDI, Other M

Of course if you were to adapt any game into a full length movie, main character has to talk if you wanna get past producers."
gaming,"If douche bros wanted their comeback they'd just call your mum.

Seriously though, douche bros hate having their masculinity challenged.. It totally ruins their day. Maybe try something like ""yeah, righto princess"" and then block them... that will kill them.. maybe even literally."
gaming,I like this more than the other one.
gaming,Could a blue hedgehog be THAT hard to model? Cmon movie designers!
gaming,The best hedgehog... the better hedgehog!
gaming,"They started using both names in Sonic Adventure 1 for the Dreamcast. Sonic starter referring to him as Eggman as an insult. Robotnik was completely phased out by time the Dreamcast died.

 IIRC, in the current continuity Eggman is used to refer to the Robotnik we know and love. The use of the Robotnik name usually references Eggman's grandfather, Gerald Robotnik, the renown and beloved scientist who ultimately created Shadow the Hedgehog. Basically, Eggman = crackpot super-villain, Dr. Robotnik = good dead scientist

I'll always call Eggman Robotnik though; it's just a better name, and it fits his shtick of creating lots of robots to kill Sonic and co. Robotnik's physical appearance tends to change from game to game, so he doesn't always look like an egg. Take Jim Carrey's portrayal, for example - there's nothing eggy about him, but he still builds death bots."
gaming,Pshaw. Real animators not only model the entire digestive system but include bowel physics simulation to ensure proper fecal accuracy.
gaming,yep. spectacular amounts of meth.
gaming,Is this true or a joke? (I’m serious)
gaming,This is what I did.
gaming,You ever drink Bailey's from a shoe?
gaming,"&gt;doing something that isn't hurting anyone

The ""realistic"" Sonic hurts me mentally."
gaming,"Jim Carrey too thin for eggman, should of been Danny De Vito"
gaming,"I know they didn't have to make him (relatively) realistic looking, but it's obvious that if the film were a cartoon he wouldn't have looked like this awful Chinese knockoff of Sanic."
gaming,tbh. pikachu is considerably much more better than sonic.
gaming,"I'd love this if the Sonic movie were actually going to be good. Heck, Marvel had some misfire characters that ended up working better when handed over to other people, so, why not"
gaming,"What are you guys talking about? That fat Chick is hot, I would fuck her! You guys would fuck her too!
Right?"
gaming,"\\\\I don't understand how he's a nazi shitstain though. I've only ever seen his ""It's okay to be white"" twitter post, But that was in no-way promoting anything nazi-related. Just because his political views don't like up with yours doesn't give you the right to be a choad."
gaming,Oh burn. He got you good
gaming,"Exactly. If the movie ends up doing well he could end up doing a movie he actually wants to or has wanted to do for years and that ends up being great, and we end up having the new Nolan, or he can just stick to Pokemon movies for money and be the Michael Bay of Pokemon."
gaming,Assuming there are profits.
gaming,"Sadly, this may be close to what he looks like."
gaming,"Up, B, Up, B, L, R, Select, Start, A"
gaming,"Nobody thought this was going to be good, c’mon lol"
gaming,Gonna try it... I couldn't find any good reviews on steam so it made me scared a bit. But I love adventure games like these with stealth mechanics. Thanks for the reply...

gaming,Did you just assume the console's gender?
gaming,Me when comparing current seasons with the good ol' season 3
gaming,Too bad it’s neither!
gaming,That thing sparks fear hell nah
gaming,Didn't Sonic X also have separate characters? One referred to as Robotnik and one as Eggman? Like a father and son thing?
gaming,The actual design literally looks like a terrible attempt at cosplay

gaming,"How can they completely fuck the design of sonic up? I mean what the actual fuck? It has to be a sick out of date prank? Out of all the dick heads making this movie not one of them said ""what the fuck guys"" sonic was my childhood but I just cant watch this."
gaming,I honestly haven't heard or seen anyone I know playing it recently. The brighter the flame I guess.
gaming,The super Mario bros movie was the start of the ssbcu
gaming,"What's incredible is that the entire production proceeded to the point that this trailer was released without anyone saying ""oh god, this is awful, redo it now!"""
gaming,Should we tell him?
gaming,This is &gt;!*comment expunged.*!&lt;
gaming,"Yeah. I wasn't really disagreeing with you. Just adding on. I assume their plan involves some sort of synergy with a possible new game if this movie does well, to a new young audience. But, legitimately a videogame Sonic cannot look like this. 

So if that is their plan, it's even more stupid."
gaming,Can we bring Amy in this movie and sonic is going to eat their baby's?
gaming,"I'm leaning towards something more restrained. Like I was thinking my go to response could just be a sarcastic ""god bless you"""
gaming,"Would that make StarFox the equivalent of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Because if that's the case, I'm in."
gaming,"Yeah, in almost all photos and videos of me it's more closed than the other"
gaming,No I hate when heroin scares me while mining. Really gets in my blood
gaming,"Na, if he brings cig, it's okay"
gaming,I seriously think Paramount is trying to make this version of Sonic as rule34-resistant as possible.
gaming,"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0862467/ is one of them, and it's good."
gaming,Yes. Yes. And yes again!
gaming,&lt;eternal scream of unending terror&gt;

gaming,Are you sure this isn’t starfox?
gaming,Goddamn you auto correct!
gaming,"Do ""Sonic - After the Rings stopped   coming"" movie, where Sonic is shown after his fame and money from the games have ended:

 He's broke, lives in a thrashed trailer, has an alcohol and drug problem, his ex-wife nags for his child support and makes a living by selling signed screenshots of himself over the internet.

Edit: I imagine a mixture of Hank Moddy, Ted and Las Vegas Elvis"
gaming,Even knuckles is clucking at this.
gaming,"I loved it, I need to watch it again"
gaming,"Maybe they both look more ""realistic"" in the world with humans, and more like they do in the games in Sonic's. They've shown teleportation using rings so it's not too farfetched."
gaming,"Eh? No, [this is the crack fox](https://mightyboosh.fandom.com/wiki/The_Crack_Fox) :p"
gaming,It's almost like they designed him without knowing they owned the rights and instead made a budget Sonic named Thonic The Spikey Hamster
gaming,"&gt; *carry* this movie.

You did this on purpose, didn't you?"
gaming,It might be related to the half smile you’re doing.
gaming,Scitch from Disney too
gaming,If the whole movie was animated and in the proper style.
gaming,How can one look amazing and the other give me cancer?
gaming,"I only worked on one production with this term. ""Eye bag"" too. I think the modelers actually set this trend when they start naming things really early in production, so feel free to come up with something even more disturbing on your next show!"
gaming,"Hey the super Mario’s bro movie is a cult classic now

The sonic movie will probably end up in cult horror"
gaming,"I can’t even imagine how he could’ve looked to NOT be creepy, so whatever."
gaming,"Well i have gotten to point of burnout quite many times with different games. So here is few stories. 
When i played WoW seriosly i basicly lost all contact to real world yes i did see my friends at school but all i did was think what i can do once i get home in game after 4 months of that i ran out of game time and realized it was time to stop i didn't even have fun in game anymore. Haven't played for almost year now. 
Minecraft i played for way too much at one point modded or on minigame servers then i just got bored and could not play any more for long time nowdays i have gotten back to it after we bought server with friends. 
Open world RPG's AC serie, RDR2 for example i got way too in to those games literally playing for 12 to 14 hours a day if i had time after the story was over i just could not even touch those games for almost month. 
Then there is FE serie GBA games especially i played trought them four or five times each in half a year randomizing everything or trying challenge runs tey haven't felt any joy playing them ever since. 
And lastly Halo reach i have played trought it hunreds of times (tried to speed run it) it's great game but not something i want to play anymore"
gaming,"If I get a legend of zelda movie I'll be okay with it.

I'll regret my words in a few years when it comes out as a generic medieval fantasy movie but present me has hope."
gaming,Friends and I played the hell out of it on the demo disc
gaming,"""Our words are backed by Nuclear Weapons"" - also Gandhi"
gaming,"Just look at Sonic's body, I don't care so much about the face. It's that Sonic's entire body is based on a professional human sprinter. In fact, the whole look appears like a human in a crappy costume.

What an absolute joke."
gaming,"Ever since Nintendo bought out Sega it's been downhill, I imagine it's on purpose and every once in awhile the Nintendo CEO comes to Sega Corp dressed in a Mario costume and makes the Sega CEO dress in a Sonic costume then Mario proceeds to fuck Sonic"
gaming,"Detective Pikachu got it right in balance, people were creeped out at first by the fur but ultimately they kept the same proportions and features so it still looked accurate. Pikachu still looks like Pikachu, just currier.

In this they've made so many additional design variations that it would be almost indistinguishable as Sonic without context. You could tell someone this was a random CG creature from another franchise who ""kinda looks like a weird Sonic the Hedgehog"" and it would probably be believed."
gaming,"Same. I haven't been able to get into any other competitive multiplayer game as much as I have For Honor. The unique combat, hero customization, and fighting styles are what keeps me coming back. It's had it's rough patches but I love it."
gaming,Both sonic and pikachu have been butchered in 2019... sad year indeed.
gaming,Ironic? You’re not American by any chance? ;)
gaming,i wonder what happened in the summer of 1993
gaming,"It's like Tyler 1 said in a rant about League, he hates league because he's addicted."
gaming,"The xp and gold bug has been around even in the alpha. I was slightly disappointed to see it not patched out and actually somehow worse than before. If anyone wants to improve at the game, I urge them to seek out alpha players and seek advice from them. Practicing with your friends when it's not a pain to join them is a good option, too."
gaming,"Well in the games you jump through a giant ring and go to the next level, I guess this is their interpretation."
gaming,"They intentionally changed the game formula, going to an rpg style of game. If you can't understand that, then it's your loss."
gaming,Maybe you're going to be the next largest rapper
gaming,Non VR. Just very nice swing mechanics.
gaming,"I don't see any problem. Try googling ""she-ra old vs new"" and see what a reboot they did there"
gaming,What’s that got to do with being bad people?
gaming,Detective Pikachu is equal nightmare fuel
gaming,Fucking insane how much better he looks with one single eyeball and two iris'. How is that less scary looking?
gaming,Why did you make the switch?
gaming,Didn’t say it wasn’t. This is the last 3 seconds of the trailer for sure.
gaming,can’t wait for “the villager” to come out
gaming,At least hop wasn't nightmare fuel and watchable when nothing else was on
gaming,When you run with the studio with the lowest bid.
gaming,Dont touch the glory hole.
gaming,The first woman should be Detective Pikachu

gaming,Yoshiiii. that's the sound he makes
gaming,STOP!!! YOUR MAKING IT WORSE!!!! *Grabs the crucifix*
gaming,"don't drink, that will just make him more menacing."
gaming,"At least Mario was a human, representing a human. The new Sonic is a fantasy comic hedgehog representing a humanized hedgehog with an uncanny effect and untrue to the material. Thats the difference."
gaming,Lol pc gamers dont understand games because we want the best? Lol sure...
gaming,"This is incorrect. Super Mario Bros movie at least looks decent, while sonic is just nightmare fuel."
gaming,They've tried to make him look more human.
gaming,I can't believe I used to have a crush on this guy
gaming,"I fear no man, but that reboot, it scares me"
gaming,Remind him that it’s a Christian Minecraft server.
gaming,"Yep I already play CS and really like it! Somebody mentioned Journey too, I’ll tale a look at it. Thanks for the advices!"
gaming,"How about a gladiator arena? 4 people on each team, fight one at a time until only one person remains. That team wins. Maybe throw lions or wolves in, like how they had in the story."
gaming,"Depends on the person. Probably have to go third party. I don't think Nintendo has maintenance support for any of those anymore. I could be wrong, so mos def check."
gaming,The both look fine
gaming,"&gt;Didn’t say it wasn’t

Yeah you did. Right here:

&gt;Actually that’s not what they presented"
gaming,I'm not feeling this realistic animation/live action thing they are doing now. I mean hell even the Smurfs looked animated compared to realistic when they made the movie and I couldn't get pass the eyes. I dont know why they dont go back to the Roger Rabbit method. Keep them animated looking with live action actors and background.
gaming,"Right? Robotnik makes robots. Robotnik. It's logical. Eggman is just fat and egg shaped,  which is obvious,  but dumb and a kinda insulting name for a supervillian."
gaming,"Agreed, but truthfully, she's mostly outside playing and we have her in gymnastics and soon swimming. We limit it to 3 hours a week of video games (excluding Sunday) ."

gaming,"Man, why did they not just make it more accurate. It seems like a good movie but jesus did they misstep with this design."
gaming,Yeah they were great Nintendo killed Sonic not sega
gaming,Imagine having Will Smith play as Sonic

Minecraft runs on OpenGL, so no DXR nor RTX here (for now at least)."
gaming,"STFU, the Mario movie is cinema treasure.  Did you not even see Yoshi?"

gaming,The mouth looks like it belongs to an annoying orange character.

gaming,Another celebrity ruined by **alcohol** *and* **drugs**
gaming,"Honestly, when I get those kind of cancerous individuals that just wanna poop on you for playing, I just mute them. BUT if you really wanna give em some kind of communication, I'd go that route. Just being really flamboyant and  over the top. Thank them for the ""compliments,"" and just keep on trucking. I usually don't tolerate that kinda crap though and just leave the lobby/mute all"
gaming,Except for the one that looks terrible.
gaming,This movie looking so bad is probably now an advantage it has
gaming,"Estimated budget is 90m

I'm guessing they're going to make at least twice that."
gaming,I’m about to end this Man’s whole career
gaming,That would be pretty neat - if true.
gaming,"Ha ha, maybe so, but right now you could give her a gen 1 Sega and she wouldn't know the difference. She plays her cousins Nintendo switch sometime and just jumps right in."
gaming,"I guess they wanted the character to look like a little boy.

So the kids that will go see the movie have easier time to emulate and roleplay as sonic ? 

Maybe little blue boy polled better with kids than little blue hedgehog.

Or maybe they just wanted him to look like a little boy because wierd reasons."
gaming,I got an eye infection atm and thought original knuckles looked weird af for a second.
gaming,"honestly, the inclusion of Jim Carrey got me back on board. I am now pro-sonic movie"
gaming,well the original did have one eye ball with 2 pupil
gaming,I can hear this
gaming,Who honestly looked at that and thought “yeah that’s good”
gaming,"No no no, don’t give me this “WE” shit...it’s “THEM”"
gaming,"They just need to make a new model. I think the voice actually sounds good. He's got some of that Sonic snark, but it's not over the top."
gaming,What SCP is this?
gaming,The only one who can save the movie
gaming,"The Binding of Isaac, perhaps"
gaming,The mouth looks like it belongs to an annoying orange character.
gaming,Oh shit i spoiled it. He's gonna take the fursuit off at the end
gaming,"There's a surprising amount of refurbish and repair videos on YouTube. Might be able to do it yourself for much, much cheaper."
gaming,People always slow down to observe a car crash.
gaming,"Why does pikachu look so cool, cute and good but sonic look like he been snorting kilograms of meth every hour for the last 15 years?"
gaming,"This new sonic look offends me..it looks AWFUL.

&amp;#x200B;

Why can't they just leave sonic alone!"
gaming,The mouth looks like it belongs to an annoying orange character.
gaming,"Pardon me, that'll teach me to read the whole post before commenting"
gaming,We were playing co-op and at times I think I was having more fun than her. I'm going to get more of them for sure. Starwars next.
gaming,"This is the only thing I even remotely like about this trailer, but I'm not sure even Jim Carrey can salvage this disaster"
gaming,he swallows them whole. duh.
gaming,Shit i remember some department store my mom went to has smash for 64 and i would be like take ur time ma im good
gaming,"[REDACTED]

... Probably memetic or something, though."
gaming,Sorry what? Never broke one. Even playing mario party. And everyone knows mario party is a remote's death sentence.
gaming,Open them up man basic as and just clean 'em see what looks dodge and give it a smell see if burnt anywhere
gaming,He is not ready for such truth.
gaming,When Sonic has had too much speed.
gaming,Its bad when I saw this minimised and I thought for a sec it was a legit leak....
gaming,Left looks like a fan made parody.

Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."

BUT NOT WITH THAT SONAC"
gaming,This one sparks nightmares

   ... the Way ....

gaming,The mouth looks like it belongs to an annoying orange character.
gaming,Rational thinking? Gtfo with that.
gaming,Yes but the kids posting these memes were not even close to being born when this thing rocked our worlds
gaming,"First that fucking horrendous pokemon one, now this."
gaming,"Sooo on the IMDb page for SMB, the lead characters are listed as “Mario Mario and Luigi Mario”.  I had no idea Mario was their last name..."
gaming,"In the internet men are men, women are men, and 12 year olds are cops"
gaming,"For what it is, super Mario brothers is a badass movie."
gaming,It's the original Xbox one controller and no she can't reach all the buttons but fortunately Lego games only utilize the main ones. Sure the other button do stuff my aren't essential for the game.
gaming,Before and after hedgehog puberty.
gaming,"I get what you're saying, but... why fur? Sonic is a hedgehog - they don't have fur, they have quills. Those are quills down his back.

The real problem (ok, *one* of the problems) is that they saw Detective Pikachu and thought ""we'll have some of that"", and made a furry Sonic."
gaming,Couldn’t they have a normal fox head!
gaming,"Old Sonic gamers: repelled by the monstrosity

Young kids: no clue what a Sonic is AND repelled by the monstrosity.

So what's tje target audience here and how do you think this is going to make 180m? I hope that doesn't sound sarcastic, because I'm really curious why you'd expect such a return at the box office. I mean I'm no cinema/marketing expert but that seems highly unlikely, doesn't it?"
gaming,"The hardware is still to expensive. Right now the hololens is being marketed towards enterprise, and also has a tiny field of view. I give it 5 more years until it has reached maturity."
gaming,It’s THAT simple! How’d they mess it up!?!
gaming,"Yes! I know how. A friend of mine did this a few years ago. You need a bear and its connected to youtube somehow. 
Step 1. Take out your phone and start live streaming
Step 2. Find a bear
Step 3. Interact with the bear, make sure you are still live streaming. 
The portal will open"
gaming,"Hah,nice joke,you have my upvote 


^^^^nothing^^^^can^^^^escape^^^^the^^^^rule34 ^^^^sickle"
gaming,So Kirby is a parasite.
gaming,Hahahah man got me with that.... if only Sonny had EZ pass
gaming,lmao I played so much sonic in first grade I could identically draw him from memory and I had a folder full of sonic drawings
gaming,Sonic is straight out of my nightmare
gaming,"Hey man, sometimes you gotta go fast, but sometimes *hits blunt* you gotta slow down."
gaming,original just looks like a tennager in a onesie
gaming,Left one is dollar store Sonic
gaming,They are the Mario Bros. Are they not?
gaming,"right but the placebo effect is a real, observable thing. it's not lying to yourself, it's fooling yourself, which is entirely different and works on a different part of your brain.  
you can look up information of different frame rates and how we get accustomed to them."
gaming,I swear he can’t slow down time though lol he just runs fast. If he’s just standing still does it even apply? They probably want us to assume  he has to be in motion or something
gaming,"Yeah and he is still called Dr. Eggman. 

Edit: and what I mean by that is that I’m saying it is incorrect to say he is only just “Eggman” or “Dr. Robotnik.” Since “Dr Eggman is something he has been called in the games."
gaming,They'll make it up in the international market.
gaming,Live action Sonic’s nose is the most terrifying thing about this picture.
gaming,I know I'm in the minority for this but I think Pikachu looks equally dumb.
gaming,What's it called in English ?
gaming,"Yep, both of those are disappointments."
gaming,"We're slowly learning, if Detective Pikachu is telling us something."
gaming,"Shit man, I remember playing that now"
gaming,nightmarish /r/crappyoffbrands on the left.
gaming,12 year olds are cops? How many of them did you ask out?
gaming,"Sort of. He quick-saved just before ruining OP's childhood, then accidentally hard-saved over his son's only positive memories of him"
gaming,If they didn’t give him MonoEye why would they give him one giant tooth?
gaming,Maybe to parallel the MCU?
gaming,People are so fucking jaded these days...
gaming,Churchill prolly said it at some point in his life so fuck it
gaming,You’re looking for r/tipofmyjoystick
gaming,Place of power. Gotta be.
gaming,The kind of things you show your friends
gaming,It s an action RPG
gaming,It's like a blue grinch suit
gaming,Can we all actually boycott the film so it has a worse box office take than the Shamwow guy's movie?
gaming,"More people here, not everyone playing Sekiro is going to that subreddit."
gaming,Sounds like you know nothing of the crunch.
gaming,So is it modeled with a human body so somebody in a suit can easily capture motion and make the movie easier to make make make or is the designer just a bit odd and tries to scare us with his interpretation of sonic. Which I think is scary.
gaming,"My hope is that Sonic Live Action is so bad it's good, like Super Mario Bros was."
gaming,"That might be why they made the design choice to make sonic more human shaped - cosplay potential.

For me it just looks weird, and strays into uncanny valley territory."
gaming,This one sparks joy
gaming,I'm going to squanch over and squanch in that closet.
gaming,I had no idea their reanimator was Chuck Testa
gaming,-actually Gandhi in Civ
gaming,With rule 34 there will be some sista's smashing too lol.
gaming,I think they tried too hard to make it look cute and ended up making it way too creepy
gaming,What I don't understand is why they perceive a hedgehog as hairy :/
gaming,Someone forgot to set aside money for the FX department...
gaming,Fuuuuckk yeah. A good Metroid movie is entirely possible. Sleuthy kinda sci-fi horror/action
gaming,Agreed. Some weird kind of radiation emitted from the chaos emerald has broken down and degraded Sonic's DNA and he has mutated into a hideous abomination of nature. Shooting the poor fucker in the head would be the most humane thing to do now.
gaming,It’s not even following the original cartoons

gaming,Did you see the fingernails?
gaming,I still don't understand how they fucked up so bad. Like they could've pushed the trailer back and re did the cgi.
gaming,It’s actually not too late to change it right?
gaming,I keep saying Bethesda has funded this film hoping people would forget about fallout 76
gaming,"Bro the kirby universe has so much story, you won't even believe it."
gaming,"By changing the design of the character, it becomes a ""derivative work"" under copyright law. So by butchering your childhood, Hollywood can secure the exclusive legal right to cash in on that monstrosity for a few decades longer than they otherwise would be able to get away with. Example: the original Steamboat Mickey design is now public domain, but the modern Mickey that parents pay money to see is still locked up as a derivative work for years to come."
gaming,"This is probably the most absurd thing I have ever seen, and I love it."
gaming,OH GOD SONIC LOOKS SO REAL CREW FALL BACK! FALL BACK! Ok sorry but it looks to weird
gaming,Holy fuck i remember me and my cousion played that game every day! It was soooo good!
gaming,He did have an awesome voice
gaming,If you know you know
gaming,That will require a subscription to their online service. I’m planning on keeping a pc box for trades for when the cousins get together.
gaming,Never played Minecraft. But I recognize the building. It’s in my city and that has always bothered me. It doesn’t make sense.
gaming,I agree with this sentiment
gaming,"Lol, it really is."

gaming,Free karma by combining 2 posts for a repost? This guy reddits
gaming,It truly was a dark day in human history the day i agreed with this. FFS
gaming,Can’t wait to see Mario bros 2
gaming,Here is why: https://i.imgur.com/EiHU1zc.png
gaming,Sonic really deosnt look bad at all
gaming,What game is this?
gaming,Actually valve can count to 4.2 billion because that's now much more they make from steam than they do from making games
gaming,"I hope that when this film is released, some talented people go through it scene by scene and replace that weird blue rodent character with Sonic."
gaming,Probably because the people behind the Sonic movie don't know or understand Sonic like how the creators of Detective Pikachu understand Pokemon.
gaming,"That’s fine, neither have I"
gaming,"**Me:** *Such an unusual name...Robotnik. How did your family come by it?*

**Robotnik:** *We changed it in the 20th century.*

**Me:** *So you changed it* **to** *...Robotnik?*

**Robotnik:** *Yah! It used to be Eggman!*

gaming,"The normal sonic was too ""unrealistic"" for them to have him fit in the normal world. I understand the reasoning but the execution is just awful."
gaming,There is a CGI Mario movie in development at ~~Dreamworks~~ Illumination too.
gaming,"how to fix the movie :

give sonic no screen time at all"
gaming,someone fucking redact this abomination please
gaming,Is that the official lyric?
gaming,They are like twins
gaming,"Well, yes, Avallach's transformation has something in common with magician's body's reconstruction. Although, I dont recall any mentioning of mage's appearance reversion. May be it has something to do with voluntary. Mages change their bodies willingly when Avallach was changed offensively."
gaming,Burn that thing with live action Stitch!
gaming,"NNNOOOO why sega u ruined tails, now he ain’t pure anymore"
gaming,Some folks in Hollywood seem to be pushing that video-game based movies need to be steaming hot garbage still.
gaming,"No, but my interest in other things has grown to match gameing"
gaming,Pretty sure this movie is one of the first signs of the apocalyse.
gaming,"It's more like an ""unnecessary change"" comment... hes already wearing shoes and is a humanoid hogman abomination... why change his gloves?!"
gaming,Just like the MCU it looks like the NCU is going to have its blacksheep be the second movie too.  At least the Incredible Hulk got to come out and be enjoyed before the recasting lol.
gaming,can you take a picture of it?
gaming,I remember the one near me having playstations with LEGO racers
gaming,"I saw the remark and was appalled that it was all serious, no cheese, no claymation, no dancing headless girlfriends, no dismembered hand or tiny Bruce Campbell’s, it was hardly a Evil Dead movie at all"
gaming,It was either the Fast and the Furious or Adam Sandler. Unfortuntaly Adam Salder didnt get the job.
gaming,looks like sonic's sexual molestation uncle that likes to take upskirt pics on subways
gaming,"Also remove those frikkin teeth. It's amazing how bad that charachter design really is, some small changes massively improve it."
gaming,The hate from this movie is totally undeserved.  I like this style because huge eyes would actually be more likely to give out from the pressure from moving at such speeds.  Plus he looks like my dead granpa who died in the war so every time you hate on Sonic you’re hating what he died for
gaming,At least it’s not live action
gaming,This better be so bad that it's good. At this point I think they're just running with it
gaming,"If knuckles is in the film I bet there'll be a scene where he says ""let's go get eggman"" then just stands there for a second before saying ""I don't know the way"""
gaming,Eye can't unsee it.
gaming,Terrifying. They should’ve used a better model.
gaming,Nah it'll be Metroid other M(ovie)
gaming,He's been vocal about how he's a perfectionist and that's why he wouldn't upload for a long time. Probably didn't like the quality anymore
gaming,tight gap ;-) If you know what I MEAAAAN!
gaming,"It’s really not that bad to DIY.  I enjoy doing it, you might as well.  There’s a pretty robust modding community, some of the folks that create modding solutions sometimes will do refurb/general improvement mods.  handheldlegends is a great starting point (website).  The cost will be entirely variable depending on what needs to be done."
gaming,"To be fair, pikachu is adorable. Sonic is nightmare fuel, tho"
gaming,"At what point do you just admit that the people behind Sonic in general don't understand Sonic?

On the other hand, maybe our enjoyment of the old games was all a misunderstanding on our part, and all the garbage since then has been how it was intended from the beginning."
gaming,"No escape method, using an elytra instead of body armor in a cave, has a bucket of water on hotbar and still burns to death.

gaming,I raise my F on high!
gaming,It will always be Dr. Robotnik to me. The Sonic instruction manual doesn't lie.
gaming,its a blue rat! kill it!
gaming,But wait the mario movie was bad. What is the sonic movie ain’t bad? Who knows? But I still think it’s bad
gaming,So the Mario brothers movie gets a pass because of nostalgia? Thats bullshit.

gaming,Realism where he not needed.
gaming,Not sorry Mario bros top ten movies all time

Don't know what's up with the head/face though."
gaming,Battleship got turned into a movie so you never know...
gaming,"Seems pretty butchered, but it looks more than playable"
gaming,...you know the movie came first correct?
gaming,"Yeah I agree, I also thought of an animation style with the normal sonic as they did in spiderverse..."
gaming,"I mean, there's a 50 episode anime iirc"

What do they have to gain from this change? It's so stupid all around. Why mess with something that proven to work and gamble like this?"
gaming,Thanks for being honest
gaming,An icon plays an icon
gaming,I asked for this movie so we could get through to the third movie where Shadow will solve the mystery of his past! But judging from the trailer yesterday and the stills I've been looking at it should probably be burnt with fire and I don't want to know what they'd do to my favourite hedgehog Shadow.

a private security force would probably have both of those boxes checked anyway."
gaming,Should've hired an actual hedgehog.
gaming,Unfortunately they're right. Lots of people will go see this movie probably because they have kids. It will likely make it's money back even if it completely tanks in reviews. I'm also sure a lot of people will go see it just out of morbid curiosity to see how bad it is.

There are also contradictions between book and game. In book Triss is allergic to potions and can be healed only with spells. In game one of the first quests is to make potion for her, and it's said she is allergic to magic.

Damn, Reds couldn't even stick to Triss' canon appearance, which is chestnut hair and blue eyes. And surely didn't have balls to leave her scars."

gaming,I mean seriously why couldn’t they have made him look more like how he actually looks. It’s really not that hard to do.
gaming,"&gt; Sonic Adventure

1998, he listed the games since 2000.

I loved Adventure, recently replayed it on the PC and its still great"
gaming,"AND they even kept the shoes, so they would still get the Nike $$$"
gaming,"All I can say is that I hope they're not planning to launch a series of toys based in the movie.... \*shudders"""
gaming,They made it into what the original one was suppose to be if it had had any budget at all... And that made it into a sub par actual horror movie instead of the comedic gold mine the original turned out to be
gaming,I think I saw this in Spore one time...
gaming,"We already had a Mario movie, or it never actually existed???"
gaming,"""It's that BLASTED HEDGEHOG!"" - Robotnik"
gaming,set it on fire
gaming,Wait I thought I was commenting on a completely diff post wtf. I meant the one with Sonic with a tiny body and skinny arms like.... actual sonic
gaming,"It could have even been made in 2d like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, that would look waaaaay better than this"
gaming,"It is way better. But it kinda has me wondering if it would even matter. The script of this thing looks like a mess judging from the trailer. I’m a massive Jim Carrey fan and I think he’s a genius, but even his performance looks bad in this. 

The entire thing gives me so many 2000’s Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle vibes.

Edit: Spelling"
gaming,maybe it did and we're all living in a yellow submarine?
gaming,"Well, let's see it."
gaming,Fucked me over right there.
gaming,Can they just stop destroying my entire childhood
gaming,"What if this was a clever marketing strategy to publicise the movie?
Just a thought.
No publicity is bad publicity."
gaming,The left one legit looks like someone in a furry suit
gaming,BIG time Rocky and Bullwhatever.
gaming,Despite being a fucking super weird apocalyptic mario movie that nobody asked for...i still liked it.
gaming,"So how does Mordhau control? Is it lots of buttons, or what?"
gaming,He has mean eyes. That's what they didn't want.
gaming,At least detective pikachu looks good.
gaming,"It just didn’t look like those to me, mostly because I didn’t think the “lass” model was in    fr/lg"
gaming,"I do recall one like that, I just can't remember where."
gaming,"I don’t think we needed a Sonic movie anyway, really - at least, not a live action one.

The character designs for Pokemon lend themselves to being converted to 3 dimensional models; for a start, the Sonic designers have to deal with problems like his ‘uni-eye’, which isn’t in any way naturalistic. The character has a ‘human’ mouth. It’s a stylised anthropomorphic blue thing that really should only exist in a cartoon world"
gaming,"Y'know, to be fair, the movie version DOES look closer to a Hedgehog then the games depictions.

That's not to say it still looks fucking hideous, of course."
gaming,"OK can we seriously please stop comparing the masterpiece that is Super Mario Bros The Movie to this garbage-ass Sonic movie? 

Look before the downvotes start rolling in, obviously I’m being a bit sarcastic here. But to compare the two on the same scale is a bit unfair. Mario Bros was a product of its time. The 80’s were fuckin’ wild, man. Sci-fi was insanely campy and video games were still pretty much only considered a toy for children, so it was a literally a sci-fun movie for kids when lots of sci-fi was still weird as hell. Plus they only had like one game to go off for story (which the game didn’t have a whole lot of) and could only do so much with the special effects given the time it was made and the budget they were given.   
I’m not saying it was perfect but as a kid I friggin’ loved it and I still do.

Sonic is a garbage movie being made to cash in on a property while they can. There’s no excuse in this day and age with our special effects abilities for it to look as bad as it does. And as for story, if they put this little effort into it visually, I’m assuming the story is going to be terrible, even though there’s multiple games, comics and TV shows to fall back on for story."
gaming,It is actually! Mrs. Robinson has the line “coo coo ca choo” but I Am The Walrus has the Goo
gaming,Why do you ask?
gaming,Where in Winterhold did you find this? It needs to be on display in my house
gaming,"Agreed, less finger clacking and more link providing bud."
gaming,Great game! I've had it installed on my Vita since 2012 he's one of my top ten games on there that I will never delete no matter how many times I've finished it
gaming,he looks like sonic-ape
gaming,"Jesus Christ, enough of this. Why do people care so much about what Sonic looks like in a movie?

Don't like it? Don't go see it. Go watch the old cartoons or play the games if you're that much of a fan. The amount of outrage on Reddit over a cartoon character is pathetic."
gaming,Honest question. Are kids today even aware of the Sonic character? I cant imagine they are as connected to it as kids in the 90s were with Super Mario Bros or Sonic for that matter
gaming,God that movie sucked..
gaming,7/10 no ergonomic (read: comfy) chair.

&amp;#x200B;

been playing nothing but dark souls 3 and CSGO and im planing on getting back to borderlands 2 soon"
gaming,"Ignore me, I was just making a zombie ejaculation joke"
gaming,"That is no eggman, it is carrotman. Would watch movie just for Jim Carrey but meh, I can watch funny scenes on youtube later on :\\"
gaming,"Vampire's Fall: Origins
It is an actual good mobile game"
gaming,"I always hoped they would add in Liberty City to GTA online. But it would have been an insane amount of work I'm sure. Hopefully they find a way to pull this off in a way that doesn't exhaust their employees, and is the GTA to end all GTAs."
gaming,Literally one of the few truly good Video Game based movies.
gaming,It would start with Mario Brothers!
gaming,Honestly I'm gonna have to see this movie. This looks like exactly the kind of abomination that would happen if you let the creators of The Fast and the Furious make Sonic.
gaming,"kind of, but i don't think it's because of me, rather because most of the games are the same drivel over and over again, so it gets boring.


i fell in love with games because they let me explore and interact with new, strange, unknown worlds and systems. i love the exploration of new, and how it forces my mind to expand.


but everything is the same nowadays, like watching the same four movies with different names all my life, nothing new, no unknowns to explore, so of course it gets boring.


so as my interest in playing all that mundane drivel fades, my interest in making something that isn't a mundane drivel grows.


i still love games (the medium) to death. i just hate how small-minded and mundane they are, because people making them are so often small-minded and mundane. there's a whole universe of experiences never even touched on before, but no, let's do another thing in a genre that came to exist in the first place from everyone aping a single game because they're only interested in thr money or fame, not the art itself, nor originality. 


doom clones, d&amp;d clones, dune clones, tomb raider clones, Elite clones. and on top of that, even those few games being made over and over again are now merging into a single mutant megadrivel something. 


f that."
gaming,Get a job fatty
gaming,"If this is true then the sonic movie is just like the Incredible Hulk movie in the MCU, only one in the whole series and cameos all the way."
gaming,Is he related to Donald Cox?
gaming,Mario Bros movie was the first
gaming,"i want 2 die, pls"
gaming,A kirby movie would suck
gaming,tbh detective pikachu looks cuter than... that abomination on the right.
gaming,"No, they're really not."
gaming,GTA 5 is san andreas lol. I'd like Vice City the most
gaming,"He gave the anti-vax movement oxygen at a critical point in it's rise; he's been silent since mostly out of PR smarts, he's never made a firm retraction. And his influence directly helped it's spread.

I loved him growing up. I'd even accept some kind of public apology for his outspoken position on something he was flat wrong about. 

But his actions have killed a lot of people (with more likely to come), and left us worse off as a planet: we are at a point of saying things like people in their mid 30s might need a measels booster, just to be safe. Exposure is real, herd immunity is fading/faded.

Be a piece of shit to your gf? We can't prove it for sure, and that all seems nasty and sad and gray area. But this we KNOW he did."
gaming,Probably because the swing needed to happen before the throw.
gaming,"Warcraft was good. Not great, but it was good.

Probably because Blizzard 100% had their hand in the making of it."
gaming,A stranger things style Ness movie could work
gaming,Yeah I grew up with Nintendo consoles but was still familiar with Sonic just as a gaming icon in general. Not to mention I remember they was a cartoon Sonic when I was five or six I used to warch. This was the early 90s.
gaming,Probably a good thing tbh
gaming,It's an alternate universe
gaming,Pikachu looks good though. Sonic looks like a blue demon gremlin.
gaming,He looks like Sega saw that lady that ruined the Jesus mural in Spain and hired a team of her to make their movie.
gaming,The left one looks like a kid in a fursuit
gaming,I hope you're ready for the next episode
gaming,"The sheer amount of unanimously negative response toward this film, almost seems like they were trying to make it as bad as possible, hoping for eventual cult/viral success, a la ""The Room""

Then I realized they spent $90 million making this piece of shit."
gaming,"Or the Nike shoe sponsorship changed the feet, which meant the needed different legs, and now they want the torso more realistic until....this monstrosity happened."
gaming,No problem! Good luck!
gaming,'Back street magic' .... sounds like its probably a porn *sigh*
gaming,"So, more cartoonish and less realistic?"
gaming,And now he has to live with the guilt from all the deaths he caused from people trying to copy him lol
gaming,Because he's fun a usually get a- to s with him if u play jungle you should try to get good at him rn I have over a 70% win rate
gaming,"A friend of mine really got me into blade and soul for a really long time but then i ended up spendig a lot of money as it kind if is pay to win and then stopped, it was a mcmmo rpg, i’ve tried a few other ones but i didnt really like any of the styles, I’m currently waiting for Kurtzpel. Also if you have any games you want to recommend please do tell :)"
gaming,"There was a Super Mario Brothers movie in 1993, but i think it’s widely regarded as not very good"
gaming,Cries in PCMR with no money left whatsoever
gaming,For some reason one of the things that bothers me most is how weird and short his legs are. Sonic is a fucking runner. The cartoon character is basically all leg. This version looks like he's about to fall over because his head is too heavy for his stumpy limbs.
gaming,Please take it away
gaming,Oh shit! Can’t wait to see the Mario!!!
gaming,It's the only way to squanch!
gaming,That’s enough reason to watch this movie. At least for me.
gaming,I like where this is going
gaming,"Cool that's Beijing. The galaxy soho building, the pants building and a generic hutong building"
gaming,[What is a Sonic anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqlnVjeXGf0)
gaming,K that's cool and all for *every other level* but this one is basically offensive lmao it needs to be nerfed not made harder. I did manage to beat it but I basically put every life and a couple game overs into it lol
gaming,I kind like the pikachu
gaming,"Damn dude, your fucking pretty! No homo.."
gaming,Deer in the head lights
gaming,"That'd be the one in the mewtwo remake. Anyway, the shape of the eyes changed, also the mouth"
gaming,"Don’t like it? Don’t comment.

Gee, it’s almost like everybody has an opinion."
gaming,Only if they can get the timelines straight and give us a decent ocarina of time movie
gaming,Everyone will remember that
gaming,I'd honestly say both are bad ideas.  One just happens to be good execution.
gaming,1. it’s a free one: *Chrome* so you can get a Pc
gaming,Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo will fit in perfectly!
gaming,"Not if Sonic looks like,uh, that"
gaming,Is that you Cricket?
gaming,"How do people not understand, that you have to adapt something, to make it work in a live action movie. The original Sonic looks like a cartoon, the movie Sonic looks like an anthropomorphic hedgehog."
gaming,"""Oi, fuk wit me mate I dare ye'. I'll introduce ye' to me two friends. **holds up left fist** Salt. **holds up right fist** n' Peppa. **snort snort**"""
gaming,the most ambitious crossover event of the century
gaming,Not really. I still love it. Most of the game genres that I've always liked to play i still play. Seems I just have less time to because of societal obligations and living with a significant other. I've definitely been getting into the new mortal kombat and trying to get into to the witcher 3. Seems like every time I'm almost getting the hang of the witcher something pops up and I have to do a chore or something. RDR2 was the same way. I'm still only around halfway through ha
gaming,I would really like to know...for reasons
gaming,MOICHANDISING! MOICHANDISING! Where the real money from the games are made!
gaming,Shut up and take my money!
gaming,"Also, can we talk about rings being portals in the movie judging by the trailer and this poster"
gaming,"So instead of ‘Hulk smash!’, could it be ‘Sonic boom’?"
gaming,"It's funny because that was the whole point of Sonic's character. He was created as a more edgy and rebellious alternative to the cutesy, family friendly Mario."
gaming,Christ this movie is gonna be a shit show.
gaming,The Witness is a really good game to relax to and solve some puzzles
gaming,I beg to differ
gaming,"Don't forget other pokemon that are in the detective pikachu and smash (mewtwo, charizard, greninja, jigglypuff etc.)"
gaming,"Oh god, yes! I had this on me PS1. Loved building them epic bases. My favourite thing to do was to take over the enemy base with engineers and start building their shit, too."
gaming,"&gt; Kinda wished they made a movie that looked like the Sonic CD cutscenes

It's not a movie, but [if you haven't seen this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDYbwdEn7rs) then there are six parts.  And make sure you catch the post-credits scenes."
gaming,This means a Metal Gear Solid movie right?
gaming,"Right is original, left is redesigned by a shitty Hollywood studio."
gaming,have to draw from it..
gaming,well ok what gen do you want m8
gaming,"Nah m8 gotta get some jam on that, or a but if better so you can stick cinnamon to it. That's my go to for toast"

gaming,"Like, pikachu looks great, sonic... not so much"
gaming,Why the fuck are his arms blue too.. they really fucked this up
gaming,Oh hell yeah. Kirby movie!
gaming,That does sounds like clone high ghandi though.
gaming,Directed by Ridley Scott?
gaming,"Not like that he’s not 
#NotMySonic"
gaming,"People's mileage varies, nothing about Mr. Mine or Jigglypuff seems to evoke uncanny valley for me at least."
gaming,Sonic vs Pikachu feels like DC vs Marvel in terms of quality...
gaming,"left: some dude in wonky costume, right: looks legit Sonic to me!"
gaming,Now I need to see the animal crossing person get this treatment.
gaming,"I'd argue he's not a giant hedgehog. But rather more of a monkey. It's questionable if anyone who designed this flaming bag of shit had even thought, for a second, that this was a bad direction to go."
gaming,Have you ever played Other M? That would be my argument we dont need one
gaming,Yes this is the sonic of my childhood that I know and love
gaming,"It's the ass, why did they give him an ass?"
gaming,I love that you can see the bald cap on the man in a multi-million dollar movie
gaming,The greatest earth defender
gaming,It’s the exact opposite of good. Every movie of that director is just fucking trash
gaming,"I read somewhere that Hollywood sometimes makes movies, then takes out insurance, then the movie bombs and they still make money off the insurance. I think they're trying to do that."
gaming,dude check the front page someone already posted that
gaming,YOU FORGOT THE SOAPS
gaming,Pikachu looks good but sonic what they have done
gaming,"Trust me, they aren't. This doesn't look cute or hot, just horrifying."
gaming,"I hate Movie Sonics teeth. I dunno, they just seem unsettling to me."
gaming,Literally nothing could fix those eyes 😂
gaming,This cinematic universe thing is going out of control
gaming,They're artists now eh?
gaming,I hear mr. game and watch is getting his own trilogy
gaming,"Finally realised that Sonic reminds me of the kid who turns into a monkey in Jumanji.

gaming,"That's what I was thinking... Probably at the end bits, there gonna show the entire roster of smash bros, but there only going to light up the ones that had an appearance in A realistic/CGI movie. Hope that happens... I'd love to see that! ^_^"
gaming,"He looks like a human in a suit rather than a sonic.

I have a feeling they did that to be able to mocap his movements rather than meticulously edit his frames. Mocap isn't cheap or easy, but in this case it might have been."
gaming,But Sonic's not dead
gaming,So it's the Thor 2 of Smash
gaming,"I think it would be more like...


Miles

#Tails

Prower"
gaming,The *baby*! *where's my BABY?!*
gaming,Please get this outta here and onto r/fortnite.
gaming,"Take the plot straight from Earthbound.

Still get accused of ripping off Stranger Things."
gaming,That sounds like a fucking terrifying movie title. Those lifeless eyes...
gaming,Not the one from like 2003...
gaming,Why does Sonic look so strange?
gaming,"Phase 1 : Super Smash Brothers (feat Master Hand)

Phase 2 : Super Smash Brothers Age of Brawl (feat Taboo)

Phase 3: Super Smash Brothers Ultimate (feat Galeem and Dharkon)"
gaming,Reminiscent of those ugly kids in cat n the hat. Mouth-nose connection is wrong.
gaming,"calling it now, tails is going to be a baby created by dr robotnik using sonic's bristle and fox dna. he won't have much more than a cameo because the people making this are overconfident about the future of the franchise."
gaming,"Detective pikachu looks good, Sonic does not"
gaming,Wtf what's with the name you fucking paedophile
gaming,God his bottom lip is disgusting
gaming,Still can't wrap my head around Pikachu with fur
gaming,The one on left looks gay
gaming,Killing Snorlax and Pickachu on dark souls 1 without summoning a phantom for the first time.
gaming,I made a 360 gwk on cod on xbox360. And it was a complete joke cause im terrible at consolegaming. And then my brother made it into a montage to fuck with me. Think its still online somewhere lol.
gaming,Which is bullshit! That movie was dope for 93 and I still like it lol.
gaming,Reddit is gonna shit bricks when Crash Bandicoot becomes a movie... I'm calling this shit now.
gaming,"It's definitely got me intrigued, I honestly thought Jim Carrey was kinda past his time but this trailer shows he's still got a lot of energy"
gaming,"Detective pikachu look really good. Almost all the pokemon in that movie do. they kept the ""real"" designs mostly. Sonic just looks nothing alike. His white fur.. eyes.. missing gloves.. different shoes. it is just awefull"
gaming,"Obviously a high diamond player.

Maybe even challenger."
gaming,FF7 did it way back
gaming,“Mom’s Spaghetti” - MLK Jr.
gaming,There was another Super Mario Bros movie in the 80s which isn't regarded as good either.
gaming,Not buying EA's shitty games

gaming,Had to flex on us with those nice shelves and record player.
gaming,I tried to like it... controls alone were awful in some parts.
gaming,i love valve and i love steam but they have been making bad choices none stop as of late. no wonder why epic games been a making waves
gaming,LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED
gaming,"Windows XP is no longer supported anymore, F"
gaming,"Try explaining biologically, why his eyeballs touch.

A white fur patch making the connection would have been nice, though."
gaming,"Dude its a hedgehog, not a sonic"
gaming,"Why didn't they at least put big white gloves on him? After they massacred him so much, that was the least they could've done."
gaming,"Downloaded, played few hours in Amorous, not exactly my tastes. No any RPG, just a visual novel. I like dialogues, but one thing when this dialogues after battle with horrible-horrible monster which was to save the world and bring a justice, bu the other case a long dialog in some cafe about ""what do you like""... :S

No any action in that game, nor pornographic pictures, they are faded with purple screen."
gaming,"Isn't part of it pandering to the nostalgia of the parents of those kids though? Ultimately there are other choices of films to take your kids to. More than ever. Studios want parents to drop 40 bucks on this in a thester, not buy it out of the DVD bargain bin."
gaming,I'd say more like the original Spiderman trilogy
gaming,I have a problem finding games through steam. For some reason it's recommending weird Japanese games. No idea why.
gaming,"Oh yeah, first time I did that it was so awesome, the sense of accomplishment to have been able to do it without any help that time was great"
gaming,"I remember a pokemon movie thread were someone said kids nowadays would never know that growing up with the disappointment of a Mario movie was.

Sonic is the Mario of this generation."
gaming,*proceeds to break game*
gaming,"You see a malformed abomination; a desecration of a childhood icon.

The masses who've never touched a video game see a cute new superhero for their kids to enjoy; and to the people selling it, it's simply a guaranteed money printing machine."
gaming,My nephew literally could never beat Lego Star wars. And I still make fun of him
gaming,"4K monitors are much better than 4K TVs for shooting games (most games honestly) so my assumption would be the closer you get to what’s better, the more helpful it’ll be."
gaming,From what I've heard SEGA sold the rights to make this movie to someone else and don't have control over this. Still their fault for letting someone have the control to do this to Sonic though.
gaming,"This dude literaly wrote ""wtf is this"" and he got 70k upvotes, two silvers and one gold"
gaming,Don’t mind pikachu. He doesn’t look so bad but Sonic. It’s like he’s had plastic surgery gone wrong
gaming,How long did this shop take?
gaming,Need to make all the looney tunes do this now
gaming,You think it would be that but in reality it would be Ridley invading earth and Samus jumping out of the tv or some shit to team up with some 30 year old dude who saves the day.
gaming,If today or tomorrow Paramount made an official statement that they were going to push the release date back and redesign Sonic to look more like the above picture.... They'd still find a way to screw it up and it'd be horrible.
gaming,"Fair amount of controls and mechanics yeah, takes a bit to get the hang of it."
gaming,"I've encountered it, but mostly when doing modeling for games. Its a mesh separated from the bust.    
Technically the mouthbag is just the inside of the mouth cavity, but people often use it to include teeth, gums and the tongue as well."

gaming,"Imagine being in 2019 with no MGS live action film series yet :(

I remember just before Snake Eater was released, there were so many rumours of a MGS film being in production"

gaming,The objective is also to watch movies on my living room. So it is a tv for movies and Xbox x / switch games
gaming,0/7 on wire management
gaming,It’s called hentai and it’s art.
gaming,"Wow, that movie is really 12 years old and the Chipmunks actually look better than Sonic does here."
gaming,I need to talk with the driver of that car and tell them that they are helping everyone around the world and spreading the word of League of Legends sucks.
gaming,WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!
gaming,"I mean he is technically an herbivore right, that would mean all his teeth are flat. Not saying it looks good but I think that's at least accurate"

gaming,Can’t wait for the Captain Falcon movie headlined by Tom Cruise
gaming,Hehehe the dark eye still watches from its tower in mordor
gaming,no wander eggman is evil hes really just trying to get rid of the abomination that is too come😂😂
gaming,"Guys, stop lying to yourself. There's no way Sonic would ever look good, even the classic design. It's better that it looks bad because now it's ""so bad its good"" and not just bad like Sonic usually is."
gaming,I scared myself with a surprise laugh.
gaming,One benefit would be to play games on the console.
gaming,They don't make bad movies. I watched the later 2/3 of despicable me 3 last night on tv and it's a pretty solid movie with a lot of good jokes.
gaming,"Sonic looks like a dumpster fire already, only possible thing that could keep it from being a complete POS is Jim Carry as Dr. Robotnik."
gaming,He should play captain falcon
gaming,"Fuck the potential of literally any other franchise on the goddamned planet. But no. Instead the producers will look at their shitty reviews and proclaim. ""Have I angered a fanbase, sullied their creative design for a quick cash grab? No. No it is the fat, greasy, basement nerds who are wrong, they're just mad they can't get girlfriends."" Or some similar stereotyped response like that"
gaming,The major difference was that a Mario movie in 93 made perfect sense......
gaming,The Mario movie gets a little pass since it was the first live action video game movie.
gaming,no wander eggman is evil hes really just trying to get rid of the abomination that is too come😂😂
gaming,Oh god i just realized that sonic's not wearing gloves what the fuck have they done
gaming,Not the Ang Lee one.
gaming,"Personally I’ve only ever played in my laptop, or my home basement tv which is probably 35-40 inches and I’ve always been happy with it. So I guess I have nothing productive to say, but I feel like 60+ is more than enough to get the whole picture"
gaming,How though? I thought we sailed past Mordor
gaming,Depending on the 30 year old dude that could go a lot of ways...
gaming,You're being a bit unfair to Marvel by comparing them to this Sonic... /s
gaming,Make his hands a bit bigger and completely white and his belly chubbier and you'll get a pass.
gaming,Isnt it sega behind this too tho? They should have copyroght issue ....
gaming,"It's pretty good because you can play the game with it. I recommend a Dualshock 4 for compatibility, they come in a range of colors too which is cool."
gaming,I want a dark Samus movie and an artsy vaporwave Megaman
gaming,"Dont get me wrong it looks wayyyyyy better than the actual desgin but Im legit convinced that sonics design is just too weird and uncanny valley in general that no matter what he will not look good in a ""Pseudo real life design"""
gaming,I’ll msg you when I want ‘your’ personal opinion. Run along.
gaming,Fun fact: the PlayStation 4 comes with a gaming controller.
gaming,Nah it's The Incredible Hulk
gaming,Not in comparison to movies now but I loved it in 1993
gaming,One can never truly escape that place
gaming,I don’t want a sequel
gaming,It looks so fucking bad I mean *seriously* who OK’d this????
gaming,"I swear to god if they do Star Fox dirty like they did Sonic, Im not going to be okay."
gaming,Boohoo. Want me to get some moist wipes mate?
gaming,"Emperor: Battle for Dune. I remember installing that into the temp directory of the university workstations and playing 4+ player matches. building 300+ troop armies and moving them towards your opponents base would lag the network to a crawl, but it was fun all the same"

gaming,"Wife at work, kids in School. Time to game."
gaming,"Also, when I read ""closer you get is better"" I think it is not totally true.
In games like call of duty, you have to look quickly the entire screen looking for enemies.
Too close to the tv, will make you turn the head and get your eyes crazy seeking all the screen pixel because is too close.
Or I am say something wrong?"
gaming,What happened with Hulk? Was the first one bad? I've seen it but don't remember it because i was a kid/young teen
gaming,Its only a little over 2 years past the apocslypse. Give it time.
gaming,So you programmed it? “Well done”.

gaming,Yes he does.   I loved that movie.
gaming,This movie is going to make one of the greatest Rifftrax of all time.
gaming," I think if they played up how haggard sonic looks, like some rejected stuffed animal, it could be hilarious."
gaming,Finally! I will have a friend!!!!!
gaming,At least detective pikachu was nice to look at
gaming,John Leguizamo as Luigi...  John Leguizamo...
gaming,To be fair you do jump into big rings that teleport you to special stages in sonic mania. Maybe they’re pulling from that.
gaming,Sanic meh boi what have they done to you
gaming,"Lol. Run along.

You came back over a day later to a fucking reddit comment.

Pathetic"
gaming,"&gt;It looks like just a guy in a sonic onesie that they filmed.

That's called a motion capture suit."
gaming,Be an adult and ignore him.
gaming,Oh my fucking god
gaming,bro that shits crazy!! keep it up.
gaming,"I honestly have no idea, but I've had it for a while so it can't be that good."
gaming,I have a 55 and it’s good. We also have a 60 and you can’t tell the difference
gaming,"I’m conflicted, do I call you a heathen or tell you to preach it, brothah?"
gaming,"Dont be overly friendly, use different platforms to find people with similar game interest, and you remember you dont have to be best friends with everyone you meet"
gaming,Are you *sure* you're not just thinking of the cartoon series?
gaming,What are you doing to scare people away?
gaming,Guile would like to know your location.
gaming,But pikachu looks cute. This sonic just looks weird...
gaming,"Oh come on, you know that's not bullshit. You may like it, but you have to admit it really was shite. Really properly shite."
gaming,Ace tru the wall in dust2 bsite in cs 1.6 in a tournament
gaming, Sonic vs Pikachu feels like DC vs Marvel in terms of quality.
gaming,Yea I never got that.
gaming,"Dont be toxic. Dont tea bag,trash talk,insult anyone or show off in any big way really. Just be a good teammate"
gaming,He just needs the giant gloves and shoes and maybe the weird ass proportions might be fine.
gaming,What platform and games do you play?
gaming,"I know right? There have been countless times Sonic in 3d looked good. So WHO, THE HELL. THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? 

I'm still not convinced this entire thing is just a joke or a meme. Please. Someone say ""Gotcha!"""
gaming,It would obviously be a slasher.
gaming,Dead link. Why do people not just use imgur or reddit hosting?
gaming,"I understand the why they made him look this way (to make him look realistic in a live action world), but it would have been better to just make a full animated movie, and avoid this weird attempt to bring a video game character to the live action world. Or just don't make a sonic movie at all because movies based off video games always suck."
gaming,"https://youtu.be/fE9yPDzVwvM

gaming,I don't understand why they wouldn't just use the 3d model.....
gaming,I can't believe they didn't add the skin to start with
gaming,"Nah my dude, David Hayter as Snake, Kurt Russel as Big Boss."
gaming,"Whereas this upcoming sonic film looks set to redefine cinema and raise the bar for storytelling, acting, vfx and complexity, forever."
gaming,"Can confirm that Power Stone existed, was a Dreamcast game, and did get a sequel."
gaming,"It’s the closest thing we have to a stand alone Flash movie, so I’ll take whatever I can get lmfao"
gaming,Dont break your TV
gaming,"1. Don’t be pushy.
2. Be yourself.
3. Find people who game in the same way that you do (i.e. casual or hardcore).
4. Find people who you connect with in some manner.
5. Keep personal/serious/depressing things to yourself. People are playing games to have fun.
6. Listen and talk.

If you do those things I’m sure you’ll find people to play videogames with. Good luck."
gaming,"I feel like thats what they meant.

They predicted so many years ago that 2012 would be the end.

What they didnt tell us is how long the end lasts."
gaming,for sure bro. you are a true epic gamer
gaming,"My high school friends and I used to take 2 - 3 days to play through and beat as many games as possible. We’d each pick one or two games, compile a list, decide times we expect them to be completed, and then just play. Essentially shifts were taken where some of us would be playing through the night, but we couldn’t play a new game until the current one was completely finished. 

During one of those times, my buddy chose to play Lost Planet. He got through the game at a decent pace, but was fighting the final boss for literally hours. After dying and screaming from frustration I asked to try it myself. I had played the first few levels of the game previously, but I did so months before this event. Basically, I picked up the controller and beat the final boss of Lost Planet in one try. 

I’m not 100% sure this is my “epic gamer moment” but it came to mind."
gaming,What platform and what games do you play I'd be happy to play with you if I have the games
gaming,"Seth Rogen, high off his gourd, helps Samus take out the trash."
gaming,"Say horrible things about their mothers through voice chat, works everytime."
gaming,"&gt;I'm sure it's easier

that's called a shortcut"
gaming,Good lord someone got excited by the possibilities of stereo sound didn't they!
gaming,"What is that game, how does it compare to twilight imperium?"
gaming,You reminded me to get new cards for my old one (I recently managed to find a new battery at a local shop (new?!? Really?) and forgot about it till just now.  A few gig duo card and some black firmware fhuckery and I’ll be cruising gears again
gaming,"I think everyone should chill out. He looks fine. I dont see a whole lot of you working very hard to recreate my childhood memories. So before you go criticizing someone elses portrayal of an icon. Remember that the more they fail, the less of films like this we will see. I hope it does great."

gaming,So knuckles is trans? Cool
gaming,this new sonic movie is the first thing in like 3-4 years that has made me experience legitimate revulsion
gaming,I would absolutely love this
gaming,"I doubt they would lose money, this has gone into the ""so bad, it's good"" territory. People will watch it just for the lolz. Though fixing it will give them a good reputation."
gaming,I see you are a good parent teaching on Xbox I approve
gaming,"Wish I had friends like You guys, no one I know likes board games. Looks awesome!"
gaming,Was it only 16? I saw that movie a couple of times. Definitely felt like more.
gaming,"What do you game on? Console, PC? If you don't mind me asking"
gaming,"Oh, I assumed it was knuckles and he was originally female"
gaming,why does every repost lose quality
gaming,It will always be Those Who Fight Further. No other boss music compares.
gaming,That is one big 3 year old.

gaming,"I had a 42” in my living room and upgraded to a 55” years ago. I played a lot of COD at the time and it was a huge difference. I felt like I needed to turn my head more to see things. Took a month or two to get used too. Now I game on a 40” Samsung 4K in my office, but I’m sitting about 3 - 4 feet away and I feel like it’s about perfect."
gaming,i feel bad :(
gaming,Saying the n word
gaming,"nope, but hoping to learn (all mental  m8) sorry for the confusion"
gaming,"Haha, I just saw the pokemon version of this meme and was talking to my friend about the owl in OOT. He didn't know what I was talking about but finding what I was talking about within seconds made me feel pretty good"

gaming,"Those end credits were the greatest thing my young self had ever seen - and back before YouTube, you had to earn the chance to jam out to it!"
gaming,It’d be better if they just killed him right away at the beginning.
gaming,"Yeah, I'd assume it's 60Hz and equal to or less than 1080p so you're not going to need much more than a 1050ti, Ryzen 3, 8 GB ram. Us pcpartpicker online, easily the best way to choose parts"
gaming,My guess is that they're going for a slightly different version of the Kintobor backstory (he starts as a pretty normal guy named Ovi Kintobor but then an accident leads to him transforming into Ivo Robotnik).
gaming,I hate to be the one to tell you but Bob died 5 years ago. In fact the 5th anniversary of his passing was 2 days ago
gaming,"Holy shit, that's so true."
gaming,"You don't. Everyone online is depressed, incels, and introverts."
gaming,"Not big on cinnamon, tends to cause indigestion"

gaming,"What is the distance for you 55""?"
gaming,“Repent. The end is extremely fucking nigh.”
gaming,She'll be 24 when he gets out.
gaming,"Would argue that the player character is far too whiny and annoying and kind of an asshole for doing some of the things he does early in the game. Both you and your buddy are kinda too pathetic to be badass bikers. 

Would also argue that the game takes too long giving you lore on the zombies. It's like 3 months in and a few dozen steps into missions before you get any of the interesting lore stuff.

Otherwise the game gets pretty repetitive... Go to a place, kill a bunch of stuff, throw a Molotov, repeat. It has everything about open world questing that you've done before... With randomly spawning enemies that continue to pop up in areas you've already been. Take it for what you will."
gaming,u fucked up asdadad
gaming,"It’s not realistic really it kinda of incorporates what they did the division with its third person point of view.

The mechanics aren’t about reflexes at all it really about you getting your shots lined up and using cover to win firefights it’s not like RainbowSix Siege

I don’t think the story line it weak but it all depends because you have to look at as you’re doing missions to meet then take down a boss there aren’t really like story elements and again from what I played the the first division it’s very similar

You can do a mission how ever you want if you want to use an APC you can or a helicopter but if you go too far out of the mission area than you’ll fail of course but once you complete the tutorial/first mission you are free to roam anywhere you want and do the missions in any order

I don’t remember what the exact name is but fallen ghosts is the one to get not Narco Road. fallen ghosts has a better story and a better overall experience where as the other is all about fast cars and it just doesn’t feel worth paying for or playing

I don’t have the season pass so I don’t know if it’s worth it or not but I’m pretty sure it’s only for the multiplayer (I know you didn’t ask about it) the multiplayer is ok for how the game is. They put some interesting elements though with different people with different abilities 

Overall the game is great and they recently added a mode where it’s like man vs machine from TF2 so I recommend also they come out with a lot of free missions like the predator mission or where they incorporated some rainbowsix characters so ubi does a lot for this game and I recommend it"
gaming,"I wouldn’t call it super realistic like rainbow six siege but still fun controls are more like splinter cell if anything I’d say dlc is okay wouldn’t call it worth it though
You can do the missions how you like but they get fairly repetitive"
gaming,Planet Coaster is like rollercoaster tycoon but the main difference is that planet coaster doesn’t suck ass.
gaming,There's a Mario movie in production by Illumination Studios.
gaming,Isn't that a bit unsafe to dye pubic hair blue?
gaming,"I see so !any fan made modifications of this which are better, though, while still following similar principles of design like separate eyes."
gaming,But there's two more coming
gaming,"i'm still quite into gaming.

been here since 1978.

what's changed \[and drastically so\] is that i no longer fuss so much about the aaa industry.  since sierra on-line and lucasarts kicked the bucket, \[and took the adventure game genre with them\] i've been paying way more attention to what the indies are doing.

i find that what they lack in graphics quality, \[although - and to be fair, my bar for this is pretty low.  i quite like pixel art and the like\] they more than make up for with interesting systems, great stories and ""fair-ish"" games.  \[by which i mean that they're not overly cluttered with microtransactions and nonsense.\]"
gaming,Let the past die. Kill it if you have to.
gaming,"""You just gotta carry me harder princess, cause I'm not gonna get better until tomorrow"""
gaming,Gaming with the kids brings it to a whole new lvl.
gaming,"I liked how you signed your post, that’s cute"
gaming,"They make it human for the kids.  Same as with the new ninja turtles movies.  My son of 10 the other day said the animation in the original movies was bad.   My wife and I just looked at him and said it was people in suits.  

They are marketing this movie for kids to take their parents to.  

I for one will not go see this ever."
gaming,Are people able to do the spinny ballerina bullshit like they did in Chivalry?
gaming,"I just got all of these, Thanks for the information!"
gaming,"it's not realistic at all, it's really just a fantasy RPG with magic where the magic is dressed up very thinly as tech. it is however still decent fun and you can do both, rapid reflex based run and gun gameplay or slow methodical stealthing through bases, whatever you prefer and think works best for the situation."
gaming,My pet theory is that they didn't want to pay for the animation work it'd require to do original sonic. His proportions and cartoonishness would necessitate 100% by hand animation. Man shaped sonic only needs mocap clean up.
gaming,"Oh jesus, u forgot about the Chun Li one.

I definitely meant the Raul Julia one!!"
gaming,totally accurate battle simulator
gaming,But then we have movies like Sing and The Grinch that make us worried
gaming,"Yea the game ended up with so many of those assholes abusing game mechanics to get easy kills, ruining the gameplay for everybody else."
gaming,They changed sonic like they changed nick fury
gaming,"So... You compare Switch version that has been just released to PC version that released years ago and is currently on sale?
But charging the same for one game as for complete package on other systems is dumb."
gaming,Basically if the division had a baby with far cry
gaming,Does he know there's a new Sonic racing game coming soon? Might be okay (it's by Sumo who did the amazing All Stars Transformed)
gaming,And video games actually teach you how to operate and handle firearms? Get real dude.
gaming,Just jump through fella 😉
gaming,"I love sonic, and I think the movie looks fine for a sonic movie. What could you honestly make the sonic movie about? Seems to work well so far."
gaming,Out of the corner of your eye you see him. Shia Labouf.
gaming,What was wrong with sing?
gaming,The struggle is real
gaming,That’s what scares me
gaming,Probably for the furries?
gaming,I feel Jim Carey is gonna make this movie good like how him and Tommy Lee Jones made the val Kilmer batman movie good despite being the worst batman movie
gaming,Never related to anything more!
gaming,The second one looks like someone's drunk uncle with all his hair dyed blue😬
gaming,Yep and negative 4 upvotes
gaming,I think that was a flash game on newgrounds.
gaming,I have watched a few get started tutorials and I have heard it on those tutorials. It's what you think it is.

gaming,out of 5 stars? I'd say... 100.

gaming,When I'm trying to relax I try and play something like Minecraft
gaming,"To me it literally seems like they copied the Flash, like they saw that both characters run fast, and the Flash always has lightning flying around him, so they copied that for Sonic."
gaming,"Same! I've only just become interested in playing board games but can see the need for a Tinder like app for Gaming buddies... Actually, scratch that...."
gaming,"&gt;USA employment benefits

Let alone being let go in the ironically named ""right to work state"" and (un)employment benefits.

The above is irrelevant to me at the moment, but I work on contract and two coworkers who have been with this organization on contract have stipulated hours and took comp time to meet the PM's demands.

In revenge for their comp time, he's trying to force ""mandatory"" thirty minute breaks into our schedules to make us stay longer."

gaming,The other one Is detective pikachu
gaming,I don't see Pac-Man. HOW CAN AN ARCADE/SHOWROOM NOT HAVE PAC-MAN?!?!
gaming,Definitely! The best part is you don't have any other Fallout experience so you won't notice how lacking FO4 is compared to other Fallout titles.
gaming,Oddly this is actually in development longer than Detective Pikachu.
gaming,So much time spent on dick physics
gaming,They don't all. They do change color though? Heard of Sonic? Used to be a gorgeous redhead.
gaming,"Ah shit, here we go again"
gaming,"I probably wouldnt go that big because you'll be straining your eyes and at that size like 60"", you'll have to be at least 3.5-4mtrs away from the screen so that your eyes don't get strained and your able to spot enemies easier when the TV is further away.

I have a 55 and I kind of regretted it after a while because I have to sit far away so that when I'm keeping a lookout for enemies I'm not having to move my head around and making it harder for me to spot people from afar.

In saying that, it's just my opinion and it's all your choice. Just putting in what I think of a big tv screen for gaming at least. I kinda wish I got a smaller one or even a monitor."
gaming,Play risk of rain 2
gaming,"Quite the eloquent way to say taking a shit would be better.

Kudos good Sir."
gaming,"Seems fair 

Do you prefer I get goty or just the base game?"
gaming,"Then game is fun but I wouldn’t recommend DLC or season pass. You will get bored after a while because you are basically doing the same thing over and over. Story is an afterthought. There is fun to be had, it’s just limited."
gaming,"I think the Mario Bros Movie was good in it's own strange way.

Like, the Goombas are absolute units for one, Yoshi looks like how dinosaurs were portrayed at the time, and Bowser was sorta human looking. It had this campy vibe to it, and that was what made it a fun watch years later.

&amp;#x200B;

It couldn't be anymore inaccurate to the original games, but it made up for it.

Can't say the same for Sonic though. The Mario movie at the very least didn't have the main character animated in CGI that fits right into uncanny valley."
gaming,The Flash being hinted by the government? Or the Flash coming into the real world and teaming up with James Marsden?
gaming,"Haha Yes an app that connects board game players sounds great, except definitely not as seedy as tinder."
gaming,"Flowers, journey, hohokum and flow are really kick ass. 

The vanishing of Ethan carter, firewatch everyone’s gone to the rapture, I am bread are a few others."
gaming,"Yeah the firefights in this game are incredible. It takes a LOT of patience to begin to play this game well. You literally cannot run around like any other FPS game, it’s all corners and controlling territory, and managing/preparing for enemy waves and redeployments. Once you understand this, it’s SO much fun to okay on defense side and just rack up points taking down enemy invaders. The sound alone is worth investing I a nice pair of stereo headphones."
gaming,"Unfortunately for this movie, they didn’t."
gaming,"Yes, he came to my house and told me to bend over."
gaming,Set em up and I'll knock em down.

gaming,Rest in peace to the poor joke. It shall be missed.
gaming,"What flaws? Why lead with flaws as if they were known and agreed? I don't mean that Everspace is perfect, but this title is misleading and does the game a disservice."
gaming,Why did i read that with dunkeys voice in my head
gaming,"Here are my thoughts, some of these pertain to life in general, but work in gaming nonetheless.

Have a working Mic and keep proper mic etiquette: don’t breathe directly into the mic, keep ambient noise down while you play, and mute yourself when you need to sneeze or eat, etc.

Find a multiplayer game you really like and do your research on it, so that you know it well. Everyone likes good players, that know the mechanics of the game. 

Think before you speak. Go over it in your head, at least twice when you say something. That’s something we all tend to forget. 

Do not verbally throw up on someone, intimate details about your life should be kept private until the relationship has matured to the appropriate level. 

Be polite, you’d be surprised how far that gets you.

Stick to your age level, hard to do but usually you can tell by the way the conversations go in game. 

Don’t be discouraged if you don’t hit it off with someone right away, there’s billions of gamers out there. So never give up!

Don’t whine, no one likes that EVER.

Be generous in the game: If it’s a loot and shoot and you got a item you don’t need, ask if anyone wants it. 

I hope this helps. GL fellow gamer!"
gaming,"&gt; should have left him completely a lone

gaming,Looks like its wearing a sports bra
gaming,"You both have good points and this may come down to the whether or not culturing dedicated employees and an employer/employee bond is emphasized.

You're right, he was unable to cope with changing needs and expectations. On the other hand, should our industries try to cultivate a relationship with their employees? This seems to be a concept scoped to the Baby-Boomer generation.

Apparently I'm considered a millenial now for some reason since the generation dates are all screwed up, but the standard in tech seems to be job-bouncing and cults of personality; engineers aren't important beyond their output, but the brand is everything and turnover is expected when you burn your staff out."
gaming,What did the deleted post you replied to say
gaming,I had a mandella in my left hand. It lasted 6 months. My whole palm was blacked out now you cant even say it was ever tattooed
gaming,"journey is amazing.

it's very tranquil, and you get to decide what you think is happening with the plot.  on the way, there's a lot of beautiful landscapes to see and /mostly/ serene platforming to do.

it is worth it."
gaming,how is what he said false....?
gaming,"About 12 years ago I was playing Battlefield 2. Some friends were round and we were going out when the game was over. I didn't want to leave because I was playing pretty well. I was alone at the top of the broadcast tower (I guess that's what it was) and the enemy team was taking the flag because it was the last one. I ended up being the last player on my team because there was nowhere to spawn and virtually the entire 32 player enemy team was around that flag. I know it was nearly all luck but rushed down the stairs from the top of the tower, must have killed 10 or so on the way down, just ran round killing fucking everyone with my RPK as my mates were shouting next to me as they couldn't believe it. I felt like a fucking god as I singlehandedly devasted the entire enemy team and retook the CP which let my team respawn and we won. I got called a hacker so much but there was an admin spectating on that server and he backed me up that I wasn't. 

Fucking loved that game."
gaming,what side is that? 1/100 side?
gaming,I've never seen such a polite conclusion to an internet conversation. See you later!
gaming,"I’m not sure about that, since there’s one scene where Eggman is wearing his red outfit but looks normal. Also I don’t know how you would go bald from one world to another."
gaming,"""no, we're not going to give him a massive cock, stop mailing us"""
gaming,I was legit gonna say this
gaming,I hope so. As long as I get to play Borderlands 3 before it all ends I can die semi-happy
gaming,"Mostly, it's just that the characters look terrible. I mean, Eggman doesn't look too bad, but Sonic is just a bucket of nightmares."

gaming,"It's in the same league of masterpiecefulness as the one and only legendary ""The Room"" movie"

gaming,I kind of like the look haha. But to each their own. I’ll see it in theaters
gaming,"I’ve met people before who feel like the way they are is annoying. You may be annoying, but not to someone who has a similar personality to you. Just find people who communicate and have a similar temperament as you do."
gaming,"You're not explaining a new concept to me I understand nostalgia. What never ceases to surprise me is people's irrational notion that new content involving a beloved IP somehow diminishes the content that they originally enjoyed. You can cherish the original and keep an open mind about forthcoming reiterations and it costs you nothing. I loved the original Transformers cartoon I wept like a baby when Optimus died, but I also enjoyed the first two Bay films for different reasons. Conversely I was a Ninja Turtles super fan, I had everything TMNT down to the mock shaving kit. The movie reboot of that franchise was decidedly not for me but it  didn't ruin my memories of the original cartoons, movies and toys because I went in viewing it as an entirely separate but similar thing. It feels like such a waste of energy to hate something because it bears a resemblance to something I loved, its not a threat I don't see why its being treated as one with such determination."
gaming,"league came out a lot sooner than dota 2. lot of people didn't know what moba was, and got hooked on league. when dota 2 came out, they didn't want to reinvest, especially into something more complex."
gaming,“NO! THAT IS NOT SOLID SNAKE!”
gaming,I was the guy who would convince everyone else to blow cash on those games. I loved cruising the indie marketplace. Castle Miner Z was awesome pre craft days. Would I be able to play half that stuff still? Haven’t had Xbox going for years since its power block took a shit.
gaming,That’s what she said
gaming,I'd buy that and I'm not proud of the fact.
gaming,You’ll play for 20 minutes and realize it’s not as fun as it used to be. Then go get drinks and watch Netflix.
gaming,except you're stuck in a game due to people being assholes and/or idiots. it's a waste of time and very frustrating.

gaming,"Anime kinda doesn't have much lore going on. The games however leave a much more deeper hole to delve in.

The Kirby series really freaked me out when they explained that all the mystical weapons that Kirby used in the past (The Star Rod and its holder, the Fountain of Dreams, The Love-Love stick, Clockwork Stars like NOVA, etc.) were create by a race called ""The Ancients""."

gaming,"I think closer is better but have a smaller tv that suits roughly  the distance you want to be sitting away from the screen or where you feel comfortable.

There's a guideline that says what distance you should be sitting at which says 1.5 to 2.5x the diagonal screen meausrement.

gaming,"It’s Reddit, dude. People creates posts bcz they think they’re the only one that comes up with it, to you it’s 1000 threads but to them it’s only one post that they just created. If there’s one dude that created 20 posts and spread it across multiple different subreddits, then I get your complaint. Other wise, just get used to it and enjoy the ride.

I just found it ironic that you’re complaining about people complaining about stuff, that’s all."

gaming,Me after losing diamond promos for the 8TH FUCKING TIME I SWEAR TO GOD IF I GET ANOTHER YASUO SUPPORT IM GONNA HURT SOMEONE
gaming,NP! I hope you enjoy it!
gaming,"That's why you press B. Why am I the only one who figured that out immediately? It skips forward just like A, but won't select anything."
gaming,"McDonald's had all kinds of old systems in the play area of the building,I'm also thirteen so I'm here wondering what your childhood was like without them😂🤣"
gaming,GTA V and finishing Telltale's Jurrasic Park.
gaming,Use B it better
gaming,"Is it just filled with snack foods for gamers, or does it actually have cool stuff?"
gaming,"Jim Carrey was handling the role quite well.  He isn't exactly the right build and don't have the voice, but he has the script."
gaming,We happy few! It's a fun little game from Gearbox. Then going retro ish with Fallout 3 and Fable 2.
gaming,"Honestly I find it more like an Ubi game. It's just boring and even the lore on the not called zombies but are zombies to be really weak. 

It's combat is as generic as it comes but without trying new things"
gaming,I recommend tower defence games. Some good ones are bloons td battles and kingdom rush. They don't require much input and btdb pauses after each wave.
gaming,I spent so much time in the map editor I can still see how the cliffs connect as if I'm looking at the damn matrix code.
gaming,Hearthstone is an awesome game and one you can easily play whilst doing other things and relaxing!
gaming,"*cocks shotgun*

You came to the wrong joint fool

BOOM

*chick chock*"
gaming,I appreciate your effort
gaming,I have the exact same gameboy and I still play on it sometimes😍
gaming,I don’t know if you tried these games but Rust and arma are also games that focus on shooting. They’re quite different from each other but I enjoyed both very much. Make sure to try some online servers if you decide to buy arma 3
gaming,Being a sonic fan is hard
gaming,There's a telltale jurassic park ?
gaming,"The analog joystick is the first thing to go, gets worn out so much that it can't track what you're doing. Mario party will infact kill it."
gaming,"That leaves one more.

Maybe someone's letting M. Night Shyamalan make a Garfield movie..."
gaming,I hear that a lot. what is better about it? many people have this opinion but I've yet to play skate 2.
gaming,"Albion online.  Full loot pvp is my jam; however, starting up can be rough right now since the game went free to play and lots of competition in lower zones."
gaming,"Now now, no need for such vile lang-WHAT IN THE NAME OF HOLY SATAN'S NAME IS THAT DEMONSPAWN"
gaming,What happens to studios in situations like this? The whole thing’s obviously going to be a complete car crash. I’m guessing it’s too late to change the character design but when everyone’s telling them what they’ve made is an abomination are there any viable options for the studio?
gaming,"Just let me hope, man. The only thing this movie has going for it is Jim Carrey and he's not even acting like the character he's playing."
gaming,What horsemen would Sonic and Will Smith be?
gaming,The room was epically bad but I still watch it at least once a year.
gaming,i liked jim carrey he looked pretty good
gaming,"Same here.... I've been sticking to boardgames that allow solo games because I have no one to play with... It's kinda sad playing alone but still fun. Dark Souls and Spirit Island are good for solo imo. One Deck Dungeon is way simpler, but also a lot of fun

Also I pledged the upcoming Bloodborne boardgame just yesterday."
gaming,"One time my teacher was saying games are bad so I stood up and said, ""no teach games good maybe you bad, I'm going to play Roblox"" and everyone clapped, my name as you may have guessed, is Albert Einstein"
gaming,Why am I only just hearing about this game!
gaming,So why is Sonic suddenly Doctor Strange?
gaming,He’s not wrong lol.
gaming,Gta v is still alive and i think its a very good choice u can log in and grind online buy cars and at the same time u can watch streams or yt. It is non competitive and tons of fun especially if u have some friends that playing the game
gaming,Nobody hates League more than League players themselves.
gaming,"i would say watch dogs 2,but that's just my opinion
tell me which one you bought tho"
gaming,"But how do you not get bored of solo minecraft, without mods, for 5 years?"
gaming,"I think the same thing. Its a live action movie. He's not going to look like a cartoon character no matter what. I think the idea was to make him look more so like an animal that could actually really exist instead of a character with super weird proportions (look closely at the original sonic, his proportions are insanely weird). Hell, for the first time ever sonic actually has knee and elbow joints instead of his limbs just bending like noodles."
gaming,This seems too NSFW.
gaming,he actually looks good i like jim carrey alot unlike everything else in this movie
gaming,"My old McDonalds used to have Mario kart GP and when they got rid of it, I nearly rioted."
gaming,"There comes a dragonslayer. Yes, it is a dragonslayer."
gaming,The McDonalds in my home town still has one of these lol.
gaming,"I wasn't even aware there was a new cartoon, but it's interesting to see they can maintain interest in the character with no good games?"
gaming,Not 100% sure yet.  It 'seems' the weapons have more inertia than Chiv and thus cant be spun (dragging is still a thing but its well presented as hip position).
gaming,"Interesting. I work in tech as a developer. One thing that stands out is the number of ""developers"" who are out-of-the-box beginners. They may have written a ""hello, world!"" once and often have some limited product-specific knowledge, but zero actual development experience, academic practice, or self-study. 

Someone got let go recently because of this phenomena.

It's created a mindset of keywords rather than algorithmic backgrounds and system engineering or contract expertise, and some PMs treat the positions as highly disposable, as my example above.

I'm fortunate in that I have the background and my employer recognizes it, but the contract environment is getting worse (but I love my team). I'm hesitant to leave because I don't want to trade out the devil I know for a corporate axe-swing of an environment. And I genuinely appreciate this team, it's the first time I feel like I have people I can rely on in a group setting."
gaming,Should still be around
gaming,"These are horrible enough, will we even survive the next 2"
gaming,"Anyone tried the game before? If so leave some comments on how the game is, if it's similar to Cities: Skylines  amongst other things. Thanks :D"
gaming,"Jon, I require human flesh for sustenance."
gaming,welcome to r/gaming mr albert
gaming,"Very unimaginative. Basically the same art directions as new cartoons. Quick, poorly drawn, and rushed. I really hate even looking at them."
gaming,"Ah, I did love the Mighty Boosh back in the day. And still do, though I haven't watched in a long time.

I still remember the classic song ""Eels"" from Season 3."
gaming,"Out of the many Eggman pictures today, I can definitely hear the music in this one."
gaming,I used a giant fallout book (guide) as a mousepad for about 2 years
gaming,"I spent $5 ($9 eBay) on a U Youse headset from a store called $5 below. Best headset I've ever used. I can hear almost everything. It is kinda cheap, but if you just need one to use one, this one works but there are more expensive and better ones."
gaming,God damn that was really fuckin dark
gaming,I bet they got carry to dress up like that right before the trailer released so they can add that at the end because of all the bad reception of the other look and now have to make changes to the movie
gaming,We are going to have to act if we want to live in a different world.
gaming,Black ops III Zombies Chronicles
gaming,You mean a quite place? I haven't seen it but isn't there still dialogue in that movie?
gaming,"I just downgraded from my 3ds to a GBC, completely worth it."
gaming,"Gonna play some vrchat with my windows mr headset, tracking isn't good but the people I meet are amazing (and weird)!"
gaming,"Yeah actually it is. Considering that most games take 2 to 4 years to go though dev to release. Sonic mania is only barely old at all.

Theres been 1 other sonic game since its release and it was being made alongside mania by the main team. There hasnt even been a new generation of sonic games since its release."
gaming,This movie is kind of meant to be just that.
gaming,"not really, more on video: [https://vimeo.com/332040373](https://vimeo.com/332040373)"
gaming,Then why does he need a fleshlight?
gaming,"Hey Serie, look up GTA6"
gaming,The analogue sticks were always broken and the controllers were always sticky and dirty
gaming,They both look terrible
gaming,"No it’s actually a bunch of gaming rigs by the look of it, apparently they have tournaments there"
gaming,I know heads can but I can't recall if limbs come off.  All my plays have been too chaotic to notice.  I'll have to look for it.  I think its moddable.  Its UE4 engine and it looks like some have been done already.
gaming,"Yea, I'm just explaining why consoles are objectively better for me and my life. I had a P.C. &amp; went back to console."
gaming,They already told you they were a Sonic fan.
gaming,"Totally forgot about we happy few! Thanks for bringing it up, I'm gonna buy it tomorrow"
gaming,I don't 'think' so.  I'm still looking for it.  It seems the weapons have inertia once you swing that may prevent this.
gaming,"Full disclosure, I think the Pikachu one looks equally terrible."
gaming,"And my point was that the game could've easily been rushed, we have no clue. Just because the product came out well, doesn't mean it was rushed."
gaming,Lmao. Yeah that's what I meant. Its way too late. And yeah there's some. But I think it definitely made a point that you can go without it for extended periods of time and have the atmosphere be the prevalent means of communicating to the audience
gaming,Stop sucking at games bra
gaming,"Beautiful, amazing cable management!"
gaming,"Finally, a reason not to hate Walmart"
gaming,"You’re right, they won’t.

You know how many people in these threads i see post 
“ uh, yeah, uh, I’m gonna see it, uh, just because, uh, I want to see, uh, the way ruined Sonic.....yea, thats it, relax guys, I’m only going to see an abomination”

It is staggering. There’s a bunch in this post aswell."
gaming,You are a mad gEnIus.
gaming,"&gt;I'd like to find friends in gaming since I don't have any otherwise

Just FYI this is a bigger problem than just friends in gaming. When you're in a real bind you need in-person friends, not just online gaming buddies. Maybe I'm just old, but I don't count online-only friends as equivalent to ""IRLs"" as they say.

That said, hopefully the advice you get in this thread can help you both on and offline."
gaming,Literally every company in the fucking world does that.
gaming,Someone mentioned the ability to perma mute chat and not have to mute each game. I would love that.
gaming,"Minecraft. It seems like a joke, but it's actually true. Start playing and set an objective for yourself, you'll get really into it.  Or Civ 5"
gaming,"It is sad even though solo play is fun, it would be cool if all us lone board gamers could create our own group, but we all probably live very far away from one another.

The bloodborne board game looks sick!! I hope You have heaps of fun with that one."
gaming,"It’s not that confusing, he is saying “flashlight” as an idea. Saying this I think. I go to play games then I remember I have work to do"
gaming,"I have the A10s and it has an adjustable mic, adjustable volume and is pretty comfy. Not sure how much normal cost is since I bought it on Black Friday but nonetheless a great headset"
gaming,"He looks like a knock off Sonic, that’s what makes my skin crawl. When I used to go places as a kid that they’d painted Disney characters but all just not right, out of proportion etc, it used to make me feel sick. This is that same feeling. 

Pikachu (and co) still look much like CGI versions of themselves; they look like 3D, textured pokemon, they’re convincing. I flinched at the first images of Pikachu but as soon as I saw him animated my brain went ‘oh hey, that’s the real deal’ and I’ve been looking forward to it ever since."
gaming,"Haha oh shit, the wait for BL3 is killin' me :/ I at least want to max out all characters and play all DLC before the end times :D"
gaming,There was a time when games came with a manual and the manual told you how to play the game
gaming,"Seek help. Unless you call men ""rods"" too?"
gaming,Might be a way to get poor people to almost-live in the walmart.  Great.
gaming,He's hard stuck silver
gaming,"You also use your middle fingers for the OG Xbox's triggers!

I always felt a bit weird about doing it myself, but maybe it's pretty common...

&amp;#x200B;

...also GRIP is pretty sweet. I just wish the devs weren't stubbornly refusing to add Rollcage-style acceleration. I like my Super Rebounds quick and nimble."
gaming,Something fishy is going on
gaming,Playing arsonist in Town of Salem and watching the mafia kill everyone you douse the next night
gaming,Y’all ballers! Where did your parents work?
gaming,Seconded! I think it’s still scary.
gaming,What were you playing? Commander Keen? OG Prince of Persia? Stunts?
gaming,It could also be from mixing that Croix with Makers Mark
gaming,"Assassin's Creed Rogue Remastered. It takes everything great about Black Flag, but with a more compelling main character, and a better story. My only complaint is how short it is."
gaming,Legs as long as the arms kappa
gaming,I finally got the final of the three paths in Fire Emblem Fates (I went for Conquest last)
gaming,We're going to have more Metroid Primes than mainline Metroid games. Mark my fucking words.
gaming,This is the loophole for when our parents said we needed to go outside
gaming,Sex doesn't sell? Speak for yourself. I'll be lining up at midnight to get a ticket so I can see Sonic's booty.
gaming,Let's post the video and give him more exposure! That's a GREAT idea!

gaming,"While I wouldn't say it ""deserves more recognition"", it was certainly a trailblazing pioneer in the realms of the roguelike's resurgence and evolution into the roguelite.

I remember playing the original vanilla version in the days before Rebirth, back when it ran in Flash. 2011, I believe."
gaming,"Two years between a game release and a movie is an eternity. Besides, did Sega do anything but publish Mania? I thought they got modders to do the work?"
gaming,"Things to say when your feels are low on health and mom can't hug it out with you:

1. You're mom sucks at games

2. That's not what your mom said

3. Yes, I do suck at games, thank you for noticing.

4. Oh, yeah? Well you're a stupid butt face!

5. I'm only six so.....

6. Don't say anything, just ignore it and get better at games!!!"
gaming,I am still pretty sure that's supposed to be Neil Peart
gaming,"Nah, that was the last one, crack fox, season 3/3."
gaming,He just gets destroyed because of invades if u dont have a team. Not to much of a problem in d2/1 but in anything below if u dont know what ur doing kayn is just a better kha.

gaming,It’s the teeth that get me
gaming,Me seeing that one made me do this like Pokémon center has nothing on the owl
gaming,"shame you can't play the campaign as it should be (start to finish), only like playling it a mission at a time, with level select. Breaks the immersion a bit."
gaming,I love this game!
gaming,Is that a cursed image
gaming,same here man... same here
gaming,"Helps that Kirby is basically a cthulian god, just also happens to look cute and is generally friendly."
gaming,"Last I checked the Walmarts around me were straight, not gay, so no."
gaming,do you have eyeballs
gaming,But why is it in a Walmart then?
gaming,"This is correct. I believe EA only develops the sports games. EA buy developers who make content on their terms, which is usually to stuff it to the brim with microtransactions and add in as many throwaway multiplayer modes as possible to meet the current trends.

Bullshit company"
gaming,"""You think this is a fucking *GAME*!?""

Nice job Op."
gaming,Guardians of the Galaxy: James Gunn's Revenge
gaming,"Probably gonna get into Devolver Digital after school with Katana ZERO, Down well and Enter the Gungeon. All great games. Either that or I'll turn my ps2 on and play some Devil May Cry because it's great too."
gaming,"uh, he kinda is (creating hate related things). thats why microsoft is disassociating him with the game"
gaming,"Yes. Besides him being blue, it barely fucking looks like Sonic."
gaming,"For Honor, I love that game is full-skill based and not RNG."
gaming,Lol. Wtf. Mine certainly doesn't. That might be cool tho...depending on the staff
gaming,"Well, if everyone owned the same game, you could each set it up and do your turns as posts. Similar to the way chess is played by people in different countries."
gaming,Well that sure was exciting...
gaming,Need to get this on my switch had it on 3ds it's a real gem man
gaming,Why latina? Because of the body?
gaming,Me too much to my marriages demise.
gaming,"kayn is much weaker than kha pre-form. k6 is the definition of an extremely early game assassin jungler - if you can't get multiple successful ganks off before 6 on kha, you're gonna have a rough time and probably end up looking like you're inting

but if you can, you'll ruin the game for everyone else and delete any carry who shows

he's a very situational pick, but in certain situations, he's *very* strong"
gaming,What I would do is look for the songs on YouTube and turn them into mp3 files. I used to do that.

gaming,Bare minimum effort just to show off your body and pass it off as cosplay
gaming,"Each to there own my man, the review doesn't represent a collective input and is solely my take.

zombies are my jam. This is a good open world zombie game (lot better than others that have tried it) so it's my jam. Ain't gotta be yours to."
gaming,Castlevania is genuinely a great TV show. Definitely the best videogame to TV/Movie adaptation.
gaming,Def one of my favorite shorts
gaming,"I mean, even with its flaws I loved Chiv, but yes.  That's almost exactly how I describe it to friends lol.  Now if I could just figure out how to disarm someone and how to get a horse / lance lol."
gaming,I know I'm gonna catch flak for this... But what the fuck is up with her face? Is she a doll?
gaming,"If you only plan on playing those games then your budget is too high. However I'd suggest spending around that as your computer will be pretty future proof for years and most likely you will only have to buy a new graphics card (or hard drive if storage is low). My pc was £1400 in 2011 and the only upgrade I made was from a GTX580 to a 1080. The i5 2500k in it is still doing OK, I'm only now starting to think about building a new one from scratch (but keeping the 1080)."
gaming,"What's sad is my dream job is a video gsme publisher. I would be so happy making sure everyone was doing their part to make a work of art come to life, pushing and prodded to keep everyone on track to make it the best it can be with what we have.

But thanks to scum bags like EA I'm afraid to even mention the word publisher infront of anyone who even makes fan games."
gaming,I don't have a Walmart
gaming,"I wanted to play League few years ago. First match? Salt. After that a few other matches with toxic attitude towards me for no reason (I mean, what can you expect from a guy who plays this kind of game for the first time?). One year break, coming back to League for first match. Again, salt and toxicity. That's the most terrible experience I got in any game ever. 

Game alone may be good, but community makes it the worst game ever for me."
gaming,"Single Moment: Beating Venruki on stream in 2v2 (WoW: Legion)

&amp;#x200B;

Accomplishment:  In the early days of SC2 (WoL), my brother and I were very high rated in 2v2.  I know no one cares about 2v2 but we did it with our own custom builds and strategies and took down some notable names in the 2v2 scene."
gaming,"I mean, if you've only ever seen the Doom movie then technically it would be the best film you've ever seen, making it the best movie ever. 

That movie is pure garbage."

gaming,I can't help but feel eSports arena is the planet fitness for gaming.
gaming,Can you explain how a store has a sexual orientation?
gaming,"DUnno, you can still play the original games, EA or not. They actually gave out some games on origin a couple years ago, still have them to this day.

gaming,"Calm down. Its only a game. 

That really pisses people off hahaha."
gaming,Gold dust has really evolved from back in the wwf-e days.
gaming,"It is for quite a while, but the ultimate aim is to build the spacecraft to get you away from the planet. There's quite a lot of grinding and exploring to do before you'll be ready to start that though. It's a great game, but I'm not sure I'd play it again as there's no variation in what you have to do."
gaming,EGM was the shit back then
gaming,"According to Jonathan Blow, Microsoft wanted more extensive tutorials for Braid.

I think this may have been the reason for all those tutorial areas in the xbox360 era.

Nowadays we seem to get more learn while you play tutorials."
gaming,"You'd be surprised, despite access to the internet, how little of awareness of the indy scene there is, especially compared to the big guys.  Even with streamers, Nintendo showcasing various Indies for download, and reddit being reddit, the nature of the beast is that *people still are not aware of these games*.

Side note: I only know 1 person IRL who watches streamers/let's plays, and it's my Fortnite obsessed nephew.  That medium isn't that popular yet.

Don't get me wrong, though - the awareness of the indy scene is improving greatly.  Even the consolers are starting to notice these games.  Isaac continues to lead the charge for the Indy scene, along with some of the other gems out there.

That all said, Isaac is still niche as hell - Rogue-like Twin-sticks are not that popular overall.  And that's just fine, since the style of Isaac is even more niche.  But the overall awareness of Indy games should be improved, not just for games like Isaac, but for all the other gems that people just are not aware of.  Yet."
gaming,Yeah but it kinda sucks they stopped making them. Guess it's for the better looking at what EA has become.
gaming,Bowser did nothing wrong
gaming,She has tall parents. We're all proportionality big. And she will be 4 in June so there is that.
gaming,"Well, this is just an anecdote. I doubt the kid did it on her own."
gaming,"The other commenters are being dicks. Obviously this was not a difficult cosplay, but she has paid attention to detailing, and she looks good."
gaming,TIL there are single player board games.
gaming,[obligatory trigger discipline comment]
gaming,Sitting on my couch was to far. (I have a “long” style living room) so I would sit in a chair about 5 feet away when I gamed.
gaming,You guys are just gonna eat this post up arent you?
gaming,"Not gonna lie, I'm kinda ironically excited for it. 

The memes from it are gonna be great."
gaming,should give this game a try
gaming,Rusviet has Agricultural?   There's your problem :)
gaming,From the streams I was able to watch I didn't see many people playing with friends. Is that an option or just luck of the draw at the moment?
gaming,"Think Jim is a great pick, would prefer it if he wore a fatsuit or they CGI him to be more egg shaped"
gaming,Thanks to everyone that replied I needed to get the Ashina skill tree and then Isshin was in the tower
gaming,I have the x and pro
gaming,Not the good kind.
gaming,It's an awesome game! I've wanted to play it for so long! If you're xbox it is on game pass right now :)
gaming,First trying Sinh blind in Dark Souls 2
gaming,"You seem really sarcastic, you’re the one that asked for epic gamer moments..."
gaming,I was never a Fan of Black Girls in Porn.
gaming,"Scythe.  Less diplomacy, more efficiency maximizing, combat is more of a deterrent.

I would say Scythe is more tie begging of a Civilization game.   Twilight Imperium is more the late game of Civ.

I prefer Scythe more as I am all about calculations than combat."
gaming,Thinkin i might do both youre right
gaming,They supplied a team to the modders and published it. Also two years is nowhere near an eternity. Its likely the script for the sonic movie has been kicking around for a good LONG time while all the legal work was being done.
gaming,Skyrim or Ghost Recon Wildlands
gaming,Yeah the hell is that?
gaming,"Two games come to mind, both free-to-play.

**PlanetSide 2** on PC is my favored PVP shooter, and an MMO that embodies the idea of being a cog in a machine. I get the feeling you're not really looking for the shooter aspect found in the game, so what's left for you are combat support roles, logistics and base building.

The other game is **Albion Online** which recently entered free-to-play. I haven't played it myself, and from what I've seen has had mixed reception, but I remember it touting itself as a game where everyone has a role to fill. That includes plain menial resource gathering and such."
gaming,Is she doing white-face?
gaming,"Scythe. I havent played TI, but i can tell you that Scythe is one of my most favorite games. I have played elipse a few times (which I believe is similar to TI) and scythe is SOO much simpler and quicker without losing any of the fun of building up to an awesome winning move (or just failing to)."
gaming,Maybe under the 5 pounds of makeup she's actually Latina...?
gaming,"Yeh I think it's something that isn't really known on the client side because half the time it isn't ever really explained. but in areas of your body that see a lot of use, e.g. hands (especially palms), elbows (and where you rest your arms if you sit at a desk all day), shoulders, pits of your arms etc etc all tend to fade a lotttt quicker. Meaning that's bad news for palm tattoos."
gaming,Ahem...for tobacco use only!! (Standard loophole)
gaming,Okay now this doesn't hurt my eyes

gaming,Red and Green had a ton of bugs and bad sprites. Japanese Blue version was made as an update to fix some of these problems. Japanese Blue was then used to create the English red and blue.

gaming,"It was really refreshing (and challenging). Most fun for me was watching her progress from the beginning. At first she would run off and do her own thing, trying repeatedly to make her character swim (they don't swim). But eventually she cought on. Only real problem with it is that in Lego games, you have to actively switch characters to complete a level, she will ONLY play the female characters, so I have to step in sometimes and play the roll of the male characters to complete a task."
gaming,Fastest reply in the West.
gaming,You looked at her face?
gaming,"You can party up with friends in the main menu, the problem is that it’s hard to distinguish them from the rest of the team because there are no icons or names until you get very close. The devs have heard the feedback though and will most likely tweak it in the future."
gaming,"For Christ sake, that's fucking sad!"
gaming,"Speaking of cartoons, in the old animated series he was, quite unambiguously, a cyborg."
gaming,Three. Take it or leave it
gaming,"You have seen what LMGTFY is right?  Clearly i knew i could google search it easier than having someone go to [LMGTFY.com](https://LMGTFY.com) typing in the question, sending me the link and then watching google google itself for me.  I just like lmgtfy."
gaming,I am more than confused
gaming,"The ball physics are absurdly horrendous. A pw will quite literally roll out 20 feet on a soft green, and even more on faster greens. So silly."
gaming,Breath of the wild 10/10
gaming,why you arching your back like that. gonna hurt your posture
gaming,Interesting. So they had a blue version in Japan as well?
gaming,"The nerd in my class (back in the day) proposed that it's due to reduced gravity and lack of friction on Sonic's part.  
No such problem for Eggman because he's a lardass."
gaming,"I do agree with you, people needs to be self aware , if you dont want this kind of shit, don't post stuff like this in reddit"
gaming,"Yes. They got red, green, blue and later on Yellow."
gaming,I’ve gotten more selective with the games I play. In the last 6 years I can count the games I’ve completed and played on one hand.
gaming,"Lots of makeup as well as a ""photo face."" You see this with a lot of people who pose for photos for a living. You find one expression that you can do over and over forever and that's the one you do for photoa."
gaming,"Gonna wait and see after it comes out. Its promising, but if it only covers up to cell or buu. Idk... I'm looking for something that goes from grandpa gohan days to jiren, maybe even (new) broly."
gaming,The 4K remake should be this year or next.  Can’t wait!
gaming,"There's the blue streak I remember, not that one that looks like he's spent his post console life on smack, crack, columbian black, uppers, downers and horse."
gaming,"They’re being dicks because they post this on the wrong sub. This sub is made for gaming, only gaming, not for cosplay, there’s other places for that."
gaming,A golden kitten with a red plume? Captain General is that you?
gaming,Micheal Jackson had a part in the early Sonic game soundtracks
gaming,She is a light skinned Brazillian girl.
gaming,"OOPS!  


OH NOOO!  


The first memes for my friends and me."
gaming,The game mode in the video is similar to modes in battlefield but it controls differently because it’s a melee slasher and not an FPS.
gaming,Sonic looking cooler than ever
gaming,I used to play it too much and I am of the mind that it is far superior to the watered-down league
gaming,Far cry 5 and new dawn are loads of fun
gaming,Witcher 3. As beautiful as it is terrifying.
gaming,"Oh good this is posted literally every day now.

Who cares?"
gaming,for the snack food
gaming,"And you came to post this here just so you can harvest some karma? This is reddit not a funeral, expect jokes and dark humor."
gaming,I think you'll have to wait for something like that

gaming,"Yeah, for over 1k."
gaming,"Whatever you say, closeted furry."
gaming,Is this a common problem amongst the losers of the world?
gaming,That wasn't scripted. The prop blade slipped out of the stunt guys hand and it went straight to Viggo. Since he had been training with a sword so long. Instincts kicked in and he blocked it
gaming,I can so see a who framed roger rabbit type movie being so much better
gaming,They hated him because he spoke the truth
gaming,No but they are working on an alcove where the haircut place used to be
gaming,Or like space jam or something
gaming,"I'm fine with how they did the spines personally, my biggest issue is the mouth and teeth. They look too human, yet all the teeth are square, like, no incisors."
gaming,Why tf did they not do this in th first place
gaming,Was that one of the times Riot were ripping off Dota heroes?
gaming,What about Bob Hoskins and John Leguizammo? (hopefully I didnt massacre their names LOL)
gaming,Didn't get into sonic till just now? He was Eggman from the get go all the ay till the 2003 revamp
gaming,im tired of these cosplays.
gaming,"As I said depends on what your after, World War Z has next to no story but lots of zombie killing and crazy zombie horde action, whilst days gone is story driven. For pure zombie killing World War Z is better, but for story and emotianal connection with characters days gone is better"
gaming,Oh no... Kirby is going to be nightmare fuel in this style.
gaming,"Live your life to your decisions. It's your life, not your parents."

gaming,I’ve been planning this for a while but my wife hasn’t had time yet. I have a couple of those shirts. Looks good
gaming,What does being Latina have to do with anything? What are you getting at?
gaming,Playstation gold wireless headset is great. Pretty sure its $99
gaming,"I had those same speakers, they were awesome!"
gaming,"Developers are openly against those things and promised if someone finds out how to ""break"" mechanics they'll patch it out.

This was one of their primary ""selling points"" when they started the development."
gaming,"Never played chamber of secrets on gbc, but I did play sorcerer's stone. I loved that game. Is this one similar?

Edit: stupid autocorrect"
gaming,Black ops 4 and MK11
gaming,I believe that is the notorious streamer hashinshin
gaming,Loved it. It was the last gbc game released.
gaming,"Walmart leases space in their superstores, so it's likely run by some other company"
gaming,"Minecraft has (mostly) no block physics, and each block is roughly the same size (1 cubic meter). This is effectively placing a block in the wrong spot and having it just hang there."
gaming,You like his white hands? Or concerning body.
gaming,Go post this shit in  /r/cosplay. I dont give a fuck.
gaming,"Would be better if the game let you exit dialog immediately with B, but meh."

gaming,"No no no, I just hate it, and I can't stop playing because I'm addicted"
gaming,"Rocket league per usual. I constantly get to platinum and then fall because I have players that cant seem to understand how to HIT THE BALL.

And my rank goes down everytime! :P"
gaming,"Did you do it? Decided to have one last go at repairing mine before buying a new one, and was thinking of just going for either retail or second hand if the repair didn't work."
gaming,You're gonna get a hundred answers if you ask for an open world game can you be more specific?
gaming,I will never understand why they didn't animate him like this. Like... seriously? How does what they've done even pail in comparison to this? This is a million times better!
gaming,Two different markets really
gaming,The elder scrolls series
gaming,Rocket league 100%. Play it with the chill and play playlist and its awesome
gaming,"&gt; Now if I could just figure out how to disarm someone

AFAIK there's a chance to lose weapon when you parry or get hit while out of Stamina. I suppose different weapons have different chances to disarm."
gaming,That's honestly so cool.
gaming,"i thought the update was actually a nice change up?

i hope this isnt one of the post hating the game because its ""cool"" to hate cod lol.

&amp;#x200B;

i personally enjoy the new layout."
gaming,"Caption says Latina, so that's a metric crap ton of makeup to get the skin tone to match, I'm guessing... Samus hangs out in caves wearing a face mask all day, so no tan."
gaming,"While I like this so much more it wouldn't work as well in a live action movie.

This should never have been live action to begin with. How much better would this have been if it was all animated like Spiderverse and actually set in Sonic's world?

I can't help but think the people in charge of this movie were a bunch of utter nincompoops.

edit: Having said that I think Jim Carrey as Robotnic isn't so bad as he's still rather entertaining but would still rather have good old chubby Robotnic."
gaming,Gtfo seems hard but isn't out yet
gaming,There’s a whole subreddit dedicated to this stuff. This would have been better posted there.
gaming,"Exactly what I was talking about, that was so damn cool!"
gaming,"what i dont get is why the hell is it live action in the first place? with movies like despicable me and minions doing so well, wouldnt that be the logical approach to take? Kids and adults would enjoy it.  Even tho I don't even like despicable me, I feel like that tone and style would have been a safer bet lol"
gaming,"Back in the 90’s most of the supercenters had a decent game room with 5 or so new games , claw machine and a dollar changer... pretty cool."
gaming,"Did you get all that?
Yes

gaming,nah bruh. thats just how a gamer talks

gaming,Oh that cool thanks
gaming,Lava flows slow enough you can sometimes contain it tho.
gaming,"The white hands I'm ok with, but yea his body shape is a little weird. Looks like the Boom version."
gaming,So much better it's not even funny.
gaming,Paramount -  Stay where you are.
gaming,"Based on another comment this probably isn’t the answer, but in Japanese they use “green” to describe blue things a lot, even though they have and use a word for blue too. Don’t ask me why though I’m just random trivia man with slight Japanese knowledge"
gaming,This would’ve been so much better if they made the film like this.
gaming,Platinum at 30 minutes? Check.
gaming,"Remember this is Japanese animation, in real life it never happens!"

gaming,"I’m sorry, are you gatekeeping gamers based on how they talk?"
gaming,"Trials of Osiris

The one way to Mercury (to the lighthouse) in D1."
gaming,"i have the Razer Man o Wars, wireless headset works great has directional surround sound which can all be adjusted via their PC program. adjustable mic, adjustable volume super comfy decent battery life. id say 10 hours if you keep the chromas off with them on probably 7-8 hours. i plug them in every night when im done."
gaming,I don't know of any games in which you build a chicken habitat
gaming,That makes sense.  Its in the tutorial but it literally went by the exact second I was distracted and I didn't feel like doing the whole thing again lol.
gaming,I’m pretty confident that it’s the best way to consume that story.
gaming,A game about eating? In NK? Seems like dangerous propaganda. I’m sure they have a knock of version though. Park-man.
gaming,I generally use cdjapan
gaming,Thank you i was struggling with that and Beelzebub says thank as well for summing him up.
gaming,"Yeah, seems people are confused how the front shops in Walmart operates. Anyone can start a business in a vacant spot just the same as if it were a random strip mall."
gaming,"That’s cause seems fucking amazing! But let’s be cautious, we know how this things end up being a fraction of what they promised."
gaming,4/10 I would have gone with a more neutral flooring in a wider hand scraped plank.
gaming,gamers are minorities. you can loosely guess how they talk based from such a small sample.
gaming,"Yes, anything over 1 day will be 2 days and anything over 2 days will be 3 days and so on."
gaming,"The Room

gaming,"You could learn unity and try to put it together over time? Idk, but you should try to convince them that it’s “Video Game Science” lol"
gaming,"Same, I’m ready to take my downvotes."
gaming,"I really, really like Scanner Sombre. It's a short one, but I've never really played anything quite like it."
gaming,"He said for the game, don’t twist words."
gaming,He is guilty of wrongthink.
gaming,Yep. Also some people don’t leave their towns so they think everything is homogeneous.
gaming,"- John, Diamond III"
gaming,I've played Scythe a handful of times and can't imagine how it could go on for 3 hours. Are you playing multiple games?
gaming,It’s to make her look like samus. White face ain’t a crime.
gaming,I have several questions.
gaming,"Deathmatch, Last team standing, Objective, Battle Royale, Horde, thats 5 pretty different modes, with Duel mode coming later after they fix some bugs"
gaming,"With the degenerates and losers that run wild in this subreddit, I should've known."
gaming,"Take everything you hear about it on YouTube with a grain of salt.  Nearly all of the hate directed at it is overblown and coming from people who decided they were going to pan the game before it even came out.  

It isn't a perfect game.  I've never played a perfect game.  It doesn't have human NPCs.  It has robot NPCs.

It's basically a FO4 with a giant map and the ability to squad up with your buddies.  The replayability after you hit level 50 and finish the main quests really depends on what you're looking for in a game and how you like to play."
gaming,I guess I should have included a /s...
gaming,"Not anymore, it's almost as quick as water now."
gaming,The one on the left literally looks like someone painted it if you look at her face

gaming,Ahh you are right.  For some reason I was thinking Dreamworks made Minions and Despicable Me.
gaming,Well worth the extra spray paint
gaming,"i recommend not going any bigger than 55"" for gaming. i tried the 65"" we bought for the livingroom  and its too much and i find the tv cant keep up if youre playing a live shooter. theres a lot of lag and its a brand new OLED 4K UHD this years model.

gaming,Do you really think game devs would be releasing games after Christmas and you can go into gamestop and ask for these sheets
gaming,Yeah they have knock off versions of a lot of stuff so I wouldn't doubt it. Don't know why I got downvoted though. It was just a sarcastic joke that someone evidently took literally.

Dont buy a laptop for gaming in college, it's such an easy distraction and regardless of what you're going into, you wont need a PC that strong to run anything you'll need for classes. (Including all STEM degrees). Instead, keep your current laptop or buy something okay for normal usage. Then build a desktop. This way you're focused on school work when need be and you can have something to go to class. A surface book is actually an incredible classroom laptop for taking notes."

I didn't see it myself, [but apparently this trailer ending shot where Spider-man swings into attack against Rhino](https://youtu.be/DlM2CWNTQ84?t=142) is literally the last shot of the film. The actual fight with Rhino is not included in the movie."
gaming,"that was exactly what I was hoping for, thanks"
gaming,"Im more of an underarmor guy


Jk new balance all the way


Fuck it. If it aint Twinkle Toez I don’t want them"
gaming,"Asset swaps? It's a different car.. Different scenary, different actor...
Whut."
gaming,"This might be an odd concept, but have you considered actually dating?"
gaming,Musta had a bad day at Summoner’s Rift lol
gaming,Imagine how fast he could run if he didn’t smoke cigars
gaming,James Bond in Resident evil?
gaming,Not perfect but a million times better
gaming,That is literally a million times better and it could still be further improved. Just shows how bad the current version is sigh....
gaming,YO TAKE THAT BACK MANIA IS EPIC
gaming,"Yeah lol, wasted fucking years of my life repeating this dialogue, lol"
gaming,"say it with me:

""DONT FUCKING RUIN SONIC"""
gaming,"Dude not even close to the Boom version, Boom Sonic is just a taller Sonic, still doesn't look like a humanoid freak."
gaming,*I will make it legal*
gaming,The worst game I have ever played is Watch Dogs one and Mafia III
gaming,Why does it say 'free' twice on the free trial.
gaming,"Three times the 1 month offer, duh"
gaming,I think it is called mordhau
gaming,Is this a new texture pack?
gaming,Videogamedunkey? Is that you
gaming,I think the trailer looks good! And as a life long fan of sonic it’s going to be massive!
gaming,"Halo 5. Was a huge Halo supporter growing up, halo 3 was my go to game for years, with crisp simple gameplay, with an excellent online community. 

I hesitated buying halo 5, after Halo 4 let me down. Went to play some legendary campaign with a buddy the day I bought it, AND NO FUCKING SPLIT SCREEN?! 

What a let down, one of the best parts of halo was playing customs games with buddies, or running through the campaign with friends. No split screen, to many abilities, didn’t feel like the Halo I remember at all."
gaming,Bruh they brought in Micheal Jackson to do some songs for Sonic 3 on the Genesis you take that shit back right now
gaming,I was literally just about to make a post about this. It does work on switch FYI.
gaming,"Good thing you have those cool shades, because this is hot."
gaming,Will I be able to understand the plot if I didn’t play Tetris 1 through 98?
gaming,virt is such a good artist you guys should definitely check out his other work!
gaming,He looks like a child in a costume
gaming,It even has the 2009 meme font.
gaming,Got one that has a message in it and one with a fish or a bug in it. Can't remember.
gaming,Terminator 2 for the Super Nintendo
gaming,So are the reposts.
gaming,"Eh, as long as people can differentiate between reality and fantasy and act accordingly.

If you got a solid head on your shoulders, down to earth, not harming anyone, and good life goals ahead of you, who cares about what you do or play for your entertainment, ignore the haters."
gaming,"Man, if you’re playing scythe for three hours that’s rough. Have you tried doing overlapping turns? Where after you take your top action the next player starts their turn?"
gaming,this is the best
gaming,What system is it on?
gaming,Best one I’ve seen as a rework
gaming,Final fantasy crystal chronicles
gaming,You’re not yourself when you’re hungry
gaming,I don't know how they could have fucked it up so much when they have a fucking template from the game.
gaming,I guess but I am going to leave it.
gaming,"you have to click ""a"" like a dozend times just so that nurse joy starts healing your pokemon, since you fn know what she is saying cause she says it every damn time you just repeatadly press ""a"" until she is done, also she says something you have to confirm after she healed them.

and if you click to much she starts talking again with you, cause the ""a"" button is the button to start chatting with npcs.

ofc you could easily avoid it with pressing ""b"" after she started healing your pokemon but it would also be a lot easier if you simply could talk to her and she heals and thats it 1 ""a"" button push nothing more, maybe for the first time in the playthrough she explains everything she does and so on, cause that was the intention of the game to understand what the npc does(for the little children) but once you are in the 3rd town or later you should know what she does so still haveing the same text as the first visit is just stupid and time wasting."
gaming,"I can't believe anyone one earth (including Sega staff, Sega fans, and Sonic creators) let that happen.

I can't believe left is real... 😢😭"
gaming,Elder scrolls 6 listed as a 2019 release? Before Cyberpunk 2077?
gaming,"Probably far easier to render too, not having to worry so much about individual hairs."
gaming,The game ends with over 14 million dead.
gaming,This... doesn’t hurt my eyes.
gaming,[Little Red Hood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt3MKJjKD2g) on the NES
gaming,OP died and didnt come back to their post
gaming,I knew it! I wanted to verify with my English teacher wife. But I didn’t dare interrupt her grading papers 😅
gaming,She has a face?
gaming,Time to replace all them torches!
gaming,"Well, I will continue using it wrong then."
gaming,14 day free trial but with new accounts every 2nd week
gaming,People who play LoL are the Smashers of the MOBA scene...
gaming,Garena Free Fire. anyone else here who would like to play duo or squad with me my level is 35
gaming,"Kid: \*dies\*

Me: It's karmawhoring time."
gaming,"The Witcher 3 no doubt. Beautiful world, encounters and a story you won’t forget. Its immersive as hell."
gaming,"He also was on fire with an enchanted golden armor.

Zombie kids going places I tell you"
gaming,"Never realized how many league players drank tea, until the last couple months I'm waiting 15 minutes between games because all my friends are steeping."
gaming,I'm out of the loop. What's so wrong with the update?
gaming,WHY WAS THIS SO HARD TO DO??? WHY COULDN'T THIS HAVE BEEN THE DESIGN
gaming,"Nah I play through every tutorial and I'm a fairly committed gamer.

Or if you play a paradox game, you play the tutorial, wonder wtf else you missed and read through 2 years of developer blogs."
gaming,Feels so good to look at this
gaming,This is the best response. I would almost buy a PS4 just for God of War.
gaming,"I know, but I'm saying the shape of the torsos and legs are similar."
gaming,Probably better for you
gaming,"That looks WAAAY better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Out of curiosity, if they decided it really looks hideous how much work would it be to change his look? I presume massive amounts of time and money?"
gaming,"You played 4p Scythe for 3 Hours... and there is only 4 stars out?! 

Yikes."
gaming,Final Fantasy VII remake is never coming out this year. It's gonna be my grandchild's favourite game maybe.
gaming,Unpopular opinion: I don't think the movie design is that bad nor should it look exactly like the in-game/cartoon version.
gaming,"Watch Dogs. Being poor usually means I have plenty of time to read reviews and think before I buy a game, but I cot caught in the hype of all my workmates buying it. My store didn't do game returns either so....shoulda bought it at gamestop."
gaming,Proof evolution is real
gaming,"Much better, the off center jaw is a bit creepy though"
gaming,I was thinking that too
gaming,Face on the left doesnt look right.
gaming,Maybe it's cheaper overall? You only have to cgi one character and effects instead of the whole movie.
gaming,"Ah, which explains why an old OT-64 SKOT is in Italy. . :)"
gaming,"I don't know.. I may not see it in the theater, but I'll watch it. Wacky Jim Carrey, I've missed that guy. I don't get the hate, doesn't look that bad."
gaming,The mouth looks a bit off
gaming,Still pretty terrible but so much better than the left one.
gaming,"or make it simple, ether in the settings something like ""1 button push healing"" or just explaining once what she does(in the first village you have a pkmn center) and in every other place its just want to heal your pkmn? ""a"" yes "" b"" no she starts healing, finish, no other context or text you have to confirm after that."
gaming,I did it just to play Horizon Zero Dawn and I ended up selling my Xbox One lol
gaming,ah damn prince of persia was my first guess
gaming,"And word order is ""signtax"", right?"
gaming,Nah next a Mario is going to randomly come out in this horrible art.
gaming,"I feel like the problem they are having is the snout/mouth in an actual 3D environment.

Because of the way his mouth is always ""front"" or facing the audience, it leaves a whole lot of empty snout around the edges and on the backside, which looks okay from a flat drawing/painting perspective, but just doesn't look okay in the real world."
gaming,"Ya, but the computer is attached to a smaller better quality monitor .  And after spending a long day at the desk, I don’t want to spend any more time at a desk.,"
gaming,yeah I saw people in anime suits too while I was on a train.
gaming,"So 5, aka 5/10.

Rude!"
gaming,"It’s the new thing now. Like back when found footage films (quarantine, cloverfield, etc) became the popular thing. They are overdoing it now because that’s what they always do...for money."
gaming,You could just emulate it on a laptop with better resolution upscaling and just use wireless controllers. Cheaper and better quality.
gaming,To say I will be playing the hell out of this game is an understatement.
gaming,"Mighty Max for the SNES.

Terrible."
gaming,Had to be me. Someone else might have gotten it wrong.
gaming,If that is their reasoning then I call bullshit. Most of the parents that are commenting all mention how the kids know who sonic is and that’s why they are excited. This whole thing is  just bad :/
gaming,I hate that shit dude says ahhhh I'm a bit Rusty then goes on to make a real life Sonic fuck outta here with that bullshit your Jesus
gaming,"Outward - the open world aspect and dark fantasy vibes are right up my alley. The combat isn't too hard, but areas don't level up *with* you - you have to prepare for areas that are a lot harder."
gaming,Like its not a cosplay if you buy one item and put it on right?
gaming,"CS GO requires much more skill and a better aim. But R6S is more fun and also more strategic.
Both are competitive"
gaming,Get the free trial for free it’s free FREE
gaming,Annnnd There goes your karma
gaming,"Spacejam was a cinematic abortion..   I want so much for it to be everything we all remember,   but it is not in so many ways..."
gaming,Probably to cash in on Jim Carrey.  I suspect the movie will make money on his name alone.
gaming,I never understood the appeal of this and Battle Royale games. I wouldn't go as far as this but just not my thing
gaming,I can't believe this man played for 5 yrs... i usually go through a week binge and i'm good for a year or more.
gaming,DOTA 2 is superior
gaming,Shouldn't even get close to 2 hours with only 4 players.
gaming,Mortal Kombat 11 and a Mass Effect Trilogy playthrough
gaming,Im honestly still very excited because I still love sonic and always wanted to see him on the big screen.
gaming,"Fun, unserious, joking opinion of a game? Nope downvote I love that game"
gaming,"You're doing that wrong.

If you say ""Unpopular opinion"" it must be followed by an extremely popular opinion.  I'll give you an example with a different topic.

Unpopular opinion:   I think The Witcher 3 is an awesome game."
gaming,"If Jontron is to be believed,  TeamSonic actually did all that though."
gaming,The physics are just better and the map was done w a lot more effort skate 3 seemed rushed compared
gaming,"I can ""fap"" quite fast"
gaming,2 of the most disappointing games I've played but far from the worst games.
gaming,"Fortnite

I don't get why people loved it. I've seen better battle royales"
gaming,"That's what's recommended in the rule book, and straight from the designer."
gaming,All this Sonic stuff is giving me flashbacks of the Godzilla movie with matthew broderick and how stupid they made Godzilla.
gaming,Is there a clan in Minecraft I can join? Kinda newish and need a click.
gaming,"I don’t understand how they got him so wrong. Like OP has done, needed bigger eyes, skinnier legs, bigger shoes + many other changes. So much better this way, and more changes could make him better still."
gaming,Your oldest friend is very young.
gaming,The Smurfs and Muppet movies made bank.  The FX are cheap and those scripts can be knocked off in a weekend.  The only real costs are the actors who are all taking percentages instead of rates anyway because childrens movies are towers of money.
gaming,"It looks so much better, but ""neither"" is the best choice here."
gaming,"Thank you, the other one makes me want to kms"
gaming,"They did the same thing with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, turned my childhood into scary abominations."
gaming,Ok this soooo much better
gaming,You know what? You're right. That IS an unpopular opinion.
gaming,I'll give you some for that comment.
gaming,How is the game?  Seen some mixed reviews so I’ve held off on the purchase so far.
gaming,Wait are those mini arcades!?
gaming,"I agree.  I keep seeing ""childhood ruined"" and ""I'm not going to see this now"" comments and keep thinking BS, you're still going to see it."
gaming,I've been thinking of picking up scythe. how is it?
gaming,"I could be wrong, but I think the image is from the DVD release with ""updated"" effects"
gaming,Because the opening cutscene of 06 with FF looking ass human characters worked perfectly and wasn't jarring at all...  Oh wait.
gaming,"Those aren’t release dates so you’re not getting any revealing information and you can go to any game stop and ask for that info . You act like you just uncovered secrets to Area 51 lol, relax your “little handy list” is worthless."
gaming,It’s just... so much better.
gaming,This looks great! Only thing I'm seeing that I can't unsee is it kinda look like his eye extends into his mouth.
gaming,That guy looks like a custom character sprite for castle of the winds.
gaming,Good ol' beige box days.
gaming,Not that anyone liked the cgi version but why didn't they do him like this?!?!
gaming,That almost sounds like a Leisure Suit Larry mini game.
gaming,"Can't they just make the same movie, and change the model of sonic to this?

Like swap over the character models?

Maybe spruce up the voice a little?"
gaming,"Not sure if it's an indie game, but I love Abzu."
gaming,We get it. Feamales make peepee hard. Can you fuck off with this shit already?
gaming,"Idk, I rebought them both on steam and have been loving them. The camera angles get a bit annoying, but Sonic Adventure has the best story of any sonic game I can think of."
gaming,##THE PEOPLE DO BETTER DESIGNS ON THE CHARACTER THAN THE DESIGNER TEAM
gaming,I've been TRYING to ignore it
gaming,"I meant the documentary ""Jim and Andy""."
gaming,2000 hours worth of dried tears...
gaming,You know. That may be the case. Still a cool story.
gaming,FREE TRIAL FOR FREE GET A FREE FUCKING TRIAL 14 DAYS FREE
gaming,like cmon bruh how could u mess that up. Right looks so much better
gaming,Both of those movies highlight the fact that the cartoon characters are cartoons. That's the point of them. How would you address that in this Sonic movie? You can't just throw cartoon characters in a realistic world without explaining why they are cartoons.
gaming,You need to use the back door only maybe?
gaming,Pre ordering a game is so dumb in today’s world unless you get bonus items.
gaming,It’s the same actor
gaming,"I feel like they could have pulled it off but they just did everything wrong. Like I can envision a live action sonic working VERY well. If they had the same team that made, lets say, detective pikachu, then I feel it woul be way different."
gaming,There is no better ending in dlcs history. Love this game.
gaming,time travel is weird because i have def killed every single person in nuka world already
gaming,"Why not just animate him like this! WAY better, and really nostalgic.."
gaming,This right here folks
gaming,I love all the improvements that come out within a day any time a shitty trailer drops.
gaming,That's because it's looking left.
gaming,I’d be down for the Boom version. This monstrosity is wrong on so many levels
gaming,"Okay YEAH THIS GETS ME HARD!

THE MOVIE ONE DOESN'T IT SCARES ME"
gaming,"Seems more like a cash grab instead of a good movie....watch they will come out and say ""we feel we should go for a new design for sonic to fit the current world"""
gaming,Heroes of the Storm!
gaming,The trailer is horrible. But this is like an orgy for my eyes
gaming,I thought that umbrella symbol resembled the Yasachi.
gaming,"it clearly states there's a mystery item on the box, so you don't know exactly what's inside you dumdum"
gaming,The ps3 PlayStation store is always a test of my patience
gaming,"True. R&amp;B was a jaunty lighthearted romp that didn't try to make themselves more epic. 

This comes off as 13 year old smoking a cigarette."
gaming,"I agree this looks better, but ... - Incoming unpopular opinion -  I don't think this would work in a live action movie, it just looks like a slightly better version of how they made Rocky and Bullwinkle in their movie back in 2000."
gaming,"Despicable Me 3 had a 80 million budget, Lego Movie 2 (IMO, it is has extremely good CGI) was around 100 million. This new sonic has an estimate of 90 million."
gaming,Shouldve just gone the whole 9 yards and used a real live action hedgehog as well.
gaming,They should make the movie in spidey verse style. It would be much much better.
gaming,how do you get a group of movie executives together and settle on THAT final product??  This guy did a fantastic job.
gaming,"Surprisingly enough i have both actually :p and i’ll agree they’re both fun in a way, i tried getting into arma multiple times but it’s just not my game and i’ll play rust from time time but i’ve no one to play it with so i mainly play solo whenever i do, unless you’d want to play, if you have it that is :)"
gaming,"Yeah, most people I see don’t do it though. It makes the game so much snappier! 

That and the recruit action, which forces the players to pay attention when their turn is coming up. A house rule my group does is that if you miss a trigger for a recruit then you don’t get it back, that really reduced the amount of times when someone would get distracted and cause a holdup"
gaming,"Love Scythe! 

&amp;#x200B;

Any fans in the DFW area?"
gaming,"But if the cartoon/game version is popular, and has worked for years, why change it?  Even if the movie design actually did look good, it would still alienate the fans, which is a *really stupid* thing to do when basing a movie on a highly popular franchise.  There is no reason they couldn't have just used the classic design we're all used to."
gaming,Jesus... just post the ending without a warning... fuck man.
gaming,"they didnt even get the colors right, its like whoever designed him had never seen sonic before"
gaming,"Spot on! I’m sorry but there is absolutely no criteria where someone’s opinion is invalid simply because they don’t belong to a Sonic fan club, or don’t have 30 Sonic shirts lying around at home, or made at least 57 drawings on DeviantArt depicting  **SON**D**IC**K, **CUCKLES** and **CREAM**^pie in an orgy with Dr. RobotDick.

Even if you’ve never heard of Sonic before, you’re still perfectly entitled to be reeling in horror at the sight of the abomination on our screens now. The ones casting judgement from high upon their Gatekept thrones need to STFU."
gaming,"Community, balancing champions and a lot of other stuf"
gaming,"It's like..

Smurf movie?  Exact same portrayal.

Chipmunks?  Pretty similar portrayal.

Yogi Bear?  A little artistic license, but similar.

Rocky and Bullwinkle?  Again, similar.

Pokemon, very similar portrayal

Transformers?  Artistic license, but okay.

TMNT?  Eh, hard to look at, but will let it slide.

Sonic?  Jesus christ, what is that?  Is it a small man wearing the stripped skin of a small dog?

Edit:  ah, now I remember where I saw this before - https://data.whicdn.com/images/122197921/large.jpg"
gaming,"God, it wasn't that hard to make him look like sonic, but movie producers fucking suck"
gaming,Yes we get it
gaming,"This is amazing, why couldn’t sega do this?"
gaming,Hire that person to rework sonic in the movie. Loads better!
gaming,"What is it with these companies and fucking up blue characters? First the genie, now this."
gaming,Omg I love that game
gaming,Heroes of the Storm hopeless matches only last 15mins.
gaming,"It was supposed to be ""Sports arena"" but they got a Persian guy to make the sign."
gaming,"Really good job. I can't wrap my head around the lack of awareness to say ""let me make a movie based on a character"" and go half measure on the execution. 

How could they not learn from the mistakes of previous movie adaptations? How did no one say ""hey, that looks kinda strange"" even for someone who has never seen sonic. 

It looks like an alien came to Earth for 5 minutes and all he saw was Sonic and and he was like ""I will make a presentation for my fellows back home."" I can't think of another time where a movie that hasn't even come out yet is so certain to flop when it does."
gaming,"Maybe not, but that movie is one of the first good examples of cartoons in real live, along with Who Framed Roger Rabbit

Also dat soundtrack is 90’s nostalgia concentrated x10"
gaming,"Yeah, so much toxic masculinity 

/s"
gaming,The first one looks like a furry
gaming,Exactly. FIFA is on there. it does not get released in December
gaming,[Best golf game already exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqhUimatMOE). No need for another attempt.
gaming,"This made me realize how much better it would be if Sonic was 2D, like in Space Jam or Who Framed Roger Rabbit"
gaming,Let’s be honest is there anything to even like? Just some things to dislike less.
gaming,I lack the minimum system requirements.
gaming,"It really doesn’t make any sense why they made him look the way they did. Realism isn’t an excuse, we’re talking about a cgi’ed supersonic anthropomorphic hedgehog for god’s sakes.

The movie better be REALLY good otherwise it’s going to flop on the sonic look alone"
gaming,"Real Life. I tried it before, there's no save point if you get far then fail it hurts so bad."
gaming,lol pretty much every mobile game that buys ads on social media does it :/
gaming,I read in another of these threads that apparently Sega is pissed at Paramount over this but it's far too late to do anything about it.
gaming,#What have you done
gaming,Latin people aren't always tan moron.
gaming,I like how random people who don't work in the industry are making more visually appealing Sonic characters than the producers themselves
gaming,"Freekstyle for PS2. Maybe it was becuase I was 12, or maybe it was stupid hard to do anything. Don't know, but I could never do anything on that game and 12 yo me was so frustrated."
gaming,"Looks like modded Sonic 2, I guess that’s alright."
gaming,"I just watched Space Jam with my husband a couple weeks ago. I loved it as a kid, and was excited to show it to him because he had never seen it. I can confirm. It was not how I remembered it."
gaming,I understood that reference
gaming,"If I were to take a guess, it's to appeal to a wider audience, likely those more anti-'anime' than those of us who grew up with Sonic.  I also suspect they're trying to piggy-back on the assumed success of the live-action Pokemon (which looks a crap ton better graphically than this abomination)"
gaming,Must be the new home of the Paris Eternal.
gaming,Hollywood needs to realize that somethings aren't meant to be realistic.
gaming,Did the people that made the CGI sonic get described what sonic looks like but never actually played a game or saw his picture?
gaming,Somebody get this guy to Hollywood STAT!!!!
gaming,"""i was copying you, sorry, i'll stop"""
gaming,Which is why it must be stopped
gaming,"She has user on reddit , she posts her stuff"
gaming,Yup. No way a mobile game looks that good lol
gaming,Yeah? Did you do the math?
gaming,"SEGA, Hire this guy."
gaming,Don't forget Scooby Doo.
gaming,Is this for people who are shit at real sports?
gaming,thinking of leaving the sub tbh.. these posts are getting too frequent. there's an entire subreddit dedicated to this. and this is not even a good cosplay. literally just a girl in a tight suit. it's nothing but karmawhoring.
gaming,"Which distance are you playing with the 55""?"
gaming,I've never seen people so unhappy to be playing a game.
gaming,"WHY THE FUCK ISN'T IT LIKE THIS IN THE MOVIE?

WHY?

I want the person responsible for that in this thread and hear them explain it"
gaming,"No. LoL will piss you off. You’ll lose 1v1s you shouldn’t. Other players on the enemy team will act so weird that they do bronze tactics at a plat level and win. People will pay Masters and Challengers to carry them in ranked. People will let through flavor of the month characters and the enemy will pick them, which so happens to counter your main. They arbitrarily nerf your main. They do something to make it so tanks are strong and now Top/JG/Support are all tanks. Your team picks Yasuo. Your team picks Rengar. Your team picks Zed. Yasuo/Rengar/Zed suicide into 5 and demand to know why you didn’t go in. Your Yasuo/Rengar/Zed intentionally feed.

Your Irelia shit talks the entire game.

Your ADC and Support argue over who’s fault it is that the ADC died. 

And then everyone blames the Jungler who’s invading and just killed Khazix solo for not doing anything.


Fun game, especially on Udyr. Still hate and love it."
gaming,Men in black alien crisis
gaming,This is how I grew up. Much smaller room though. 😊
gaming,I think his stomach bugs me more. They should go back to the bare skin.
gaming,"This is cool, but probably too cartoonish for a live action movie."
gaming,It's the entire shape of his face.  Not just the mouth.
gaming,Every kid has that one movie that was made for children that ended up terrifying them because of a certain type of animation or characters looking weird. This movie is going to be that for MANY kids.
gaming,"nope, looks nothing alike"
gaming,Why does he have a single eye with two irises??
gaming,Naw. But mine sells cars now.
gaming,"Seeing the first sonic makes me thing ""WTF is that thing no way ill see that"" to seeing the new one and saying ""SONIC MY BOY!!! WHEN CAN I SEE YOUR MOVIE"""
gaming,The fanbase is... diverse.
gaming,God how I loved this game. I could never beat the Earth Scorpion boss though
gaming,Shhhh that game never happened o_o
gaming,"""Uhh....meow?"" 

Can you fix that OP? Can you fix that?"
gaming,"Make sure you get the bottle from Talon and from the Cucoo Lady.

For Talon, go to Lon Lon Ranch and do the Super Cucoo Minigame. Win for the first time to get the bottle.

For the Cucoo Lady, find all of the Cucoos in Kakariko (Did I spell that location right?). You’re going to need a Cucoo just to get to a certain area.

Hope this helps, the Bottle is a very useful tool. It’s been a loooong time since I played OoT3D."
gaming,This game looks awesome I'll see if I can find it in any stores by me
gaming,"The Witcher 3, Skyrim, and Ghost Recon Wildlands"
gaming,FIFA and NHL games are always released in September. And TES 6 definitely wont be released this year.
gaming,It looks better. Way better it’s actually good.
gaming,"The twist will be that the Sonic movie will actually be a horror film when it comes out. 

*That's* why it looks like something that wouldn't look out of place if you woke up with it standing next to your bed holding a chainsaw in the middle of the night."
gaming,It's almost like the years spent refining Sonic's design was on purpose.  But that can't be.
gaming,"Someone else once said it on Reddit.

It's to sell shoes. Sonics legs don't look natural with human shoes. Gotta give him human legs. Now his arms look off, gotta give him human arms, etc. Now he looks more real than fantasy, that head looks fucked up on that body, gotta change the face.

Just kept snowballing on the unchangeable foundation that is ""we want to sell shoes, sonic has to wear those shoes""."
gaming,they're pretty gimmicky. it's a good nostalgia hit but not really worth the price and more hardware to have
gaming,Hardcore mode is the only mode *sage nod*
gaming,I would pay double just to make sure he looks like this.
gaming,What monitor should I have ideally then?.
gaming,"Triple stamp, no erasies, touch blue make it true."
gaming,So you too have met Jesus?
gaming,I can't say I've done it with a Pokémon game but I remember playing Dissidia on the original psp in Japanese and not having a clue what was going on. Even so I did manage to complete it. I played it again in English after it released here and there were so many features and mechanics that I just wasn't aware of.
gaming,Problem with this is how would it look with the rest of the movie? Would the cartoony style fit in with everything else? I think it's a little too far into cartoon to fit well. Just changing his eyes to the cartoon eyes seems to fix a lot of the problems.
gaming,"&gt; still doesn't look like a humanoid freak.

Whoa, let's not start changing our minds about Boom Sonic just because the movie version is worse."
gaming,Still change your name every 14 days just to stick it to the man.
gaming,"Thanks, I hate it"
gaming,Left Sonic just looks like a human in a blue pajama onesie.
gaming,"&gt; pail

Pail is a bucket. I believe you're trying to use pale which is used in comparisons. ""This pales in comparison to that"""
gaming,"Why don't we just combine the two? 

&amp;#x200B;

Oh wait, AA and AG."
gaming,This should be how the movie looks
gaming,I love you times 3000!!
gaming,does this count as cosplay?
gaming,"My mom still has hers (galaga one) from like the 1970’s or whatever and it still works and imo it’s pretty fun (except the controller stick is kinda stiff but yknow, it came from the 1970’s)"
gaming,Definitely a lot better
gaming,idk why you're getting downvoted lmao let this man have his opinion personally I'm only excited for eggman cause that casting was great.
gaming,Why are you okay with the white hands?
gaming,"Why not just ever connect the eyeballs like thats one of the most important pieces to the appeal to Sonics character yet they fuck even that up.

EDIT: Small grammar mistake fixed"
gaming,YOU CAN'T TRIPLE STAMP A DOUBLE STAMP!!
gaming,This subreddit is mostly low quality memes and jokes with some relation to gaming. It's only when there's a cosplay that people lose their minds. This cosplay is just as much related to gaming as the current two top posts that are about the sonic movie adaptation.
gaming,"So. much. better. Not to discredit your work brother but this seems like a rather easy thing for the people making the movie to do, yet they've still fucked it up beyond belief. I don't know if it comes down to incompetence or what, but you've just done their job better than they have. Good stuff man."
gaming,"This entire debacle was to make it easier for kids to be Sonic for Halloween. ""Just make him look like a 7 year old in a suit""."
gaming,"Don't worry, your not the only one."
gaming,"But is there any real way that Sonic could be ""translated"" to live action with CGI? Personally, I feel like sometimes you can't just directly try to impose a cartoon as CGI in a live action movie, it's still very uncanny valley to me. At least in my opinion."
gaming,"Seeing this makes me think. What if, in the movie, sonic wears goggles that make his eyes like like one conjoined blob in the game? Most of the issues I have about that uncanny mess are his eyes, that would fix a lot of them."
gaming,I love this man
gaming,"Welp, that's it. We're done for."
gaming,Fuck they need to redo the movie now. Anything else is unacceptable
gaming,"Ofuk 

This needs more visibility, for we have all forgotten this cardinal sin..."
gaming,Wow the original screenshot feels like some guy is dressed in sonic outfit ... Look at his legs my god
gaming,It would have worked just fine. He looks like what he would look like. We've seen everything from cartoons to photorealistic animation and they work fine if the viewer accepts it in the tone of the film.
gaming,I can't unsee his his bottom teeths location in his mouth.
gaming,Hey! I'm not a degenerate.
gaming,Each of these posts makes me realize why then went with the weird fur suit instead of this Saturday morning bullshit.
gaming,The place changes but the people remain the same
gaming,"For real though, it's as if they didn't do a single screen test with an audience that actually grew up in the era and played the game."
gaming,Only my interest in multiplayer games that aren't co-op only.
gaming,*Looney Tunes: Back in Action*?
gaming,I had to have kids to get someone to play with me. Now my 8yo is super impatient for days when we play Descent or Zombicide.
gaming,"**Too gast, for the naked eye! Sonic the RatDog!**"
gaming,You got downvoted for a fact. Sorry let me help.
gaming,I would disagree I've played both and rainbow six is more strategic but in terms of skill they both need different sets of skills not necessarily one needs more then the other
gaming,"The name of the item you get is ""Xbox Game Pass 14 Day Free trial"" and the price is ""Free"". They just didn't think about how it is shown there."
gaming,Sega hire this man
gaming,We should all go bowling to celebrate.
gaming,I don't really play blackout so I don't mind
gaming,They reshot how many if the Star Wars films after they seemed horrible?
gaming,No she can but now she can do it while in true stealth under your tower :D to be fair she's hard to play now so its manly pros that abuse her.
gaming,"I remember one friend that played through one of the Zelda (on DS console, dont remember which one) in Japanese. He didnt know japanese. I was (and still am) impressed by that accomplishment"
gaming,I like my women like I like my peanut butter. Thick.
gaming,Sounds like it isn't fun at all friend
gaming,Some of the adds were pulling gameplay from games like Total War and even took footage right from a YouTuber called Pixelated Apollo. It was blatant as hell.
gaming,That's Sanec the hedgedog
gaming,"Honestly? I would watch a movie about THIS guy.
The new guy, however? nahh"
gaming,"I hope not. Jim Carrey has fallen as far I concerned. Dude turned into an anti-vaxxer and supported Jenny McCarthy, likely because he was with her, which makes it so much worse."
gaming,"Now I'm curious, Instagram name?"
gaming,That's how everything looks like from where he's from. (or was created) We look like us. He looks like them. (wouldn't even have to look like a cartoon but more like the cgi animation as the op has shown)
gaming,This is so much better
gaming,Maybe it's one big advertisement for a sonic cleaner for dentures
gaming,With the new update my friend and I jumped back in to start a new world again. Plenty of new stuff
gaming,That looks like something Egoraptor or OneyNG would do.
gaming,Arams are the best with a couple friends.
gaming,"I she breathes shes a

&amp;#x200B;

**THHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT**"
gaming,"Lol, a real headgehog painted blue."
gaming,This actually looks really good.
gaming,Never say it’s an accident you did this on purpose
gaming,Wait you still have a HMV? Thought they went bust and all closed down.
gaming,At this point that's just not an option for them.
gaming,"Hedgies have fur, but I completely get what you mean. They took Sonic the Hedgehog and made him look like the Creeping Unknown, he's like the Missing Link. An abomination under god."
gaming,The hero we need.
gaming,"Age of Empires is fun. Portal Two is great.

I'd recommend Mass Effect original trilogy, but not sure if you're into fps. Bioshock Infinite similarly."
gaming,I have an annuity and I need cash now
gaming,He deserves it 100% though. Their current playthrough of Twilight Princess is almost unbearable to watch. Half of these games he claims to have beat in the past but I'm rather skeptical on that statement. If he had played TP before he wouldn't have wasted 5 minutes throwing an eagle at a platform that *clearly has the same whistle plant on it!*
gaming,"Maybe that's all just hair and if you shave him down he would like like the right side?

I don't mind the new build because there is no way you run that many steps and don't get some well defined legs."
gaming,"Thanks, I hate it!"
gaming,That's how his teeth have always been though
gaming,"I've heard that one too, and unfortunately I can see that being the case.  Apparently the problem is that if they made the shoes as comically big as Sonic's, they would no longer be accurate, so they decided to make Sonic bigger so the shoes would look realistic.  

The solution, imo, would be to make Sonic smaller but keep the shoes at a realistic size.  That way the shoes are the size the company wants them to be shown, but they *look* comically large like they do in the games.  They did a similar thing in one of the older 3D games when they gave Sonic a particular pair of shoes based on a brand they were advertising."
gaming,A single frame from a CGI movie can take hours to render. From Finding Nemo I think some frames were upwards of six hours.
gaming,"I dunno, bro. These last TMNT were *rough*. I'd probably put them in the exact same camp as ""movie Sonic""."
gaming,Movie Sonic's beefy legs and tiny head are a real problem.
gaming,"I prefer the right one, the left one is the thing that giants my nightmares"
gaming,"Marsten, McDonough, and Carrey sure hope there's a lot of money involved."
gaming,"His eyes have ALWAYS been giant. I understand maybe scrapping the uni-eye portion where his eyes join, but they made his eyes so small that it doesn't look like Sonic. 

Then the mouth and nose not being on a pronounced enough snout makes him look worse. 

The proportions of his body are a disaster too. They gave up everything that made him look like him. 

Add to that the fact that his fur seems too furry and not like slick spines, and suddenly he's looking super weird."
gaming,"Only in the Nether though? Or did they change that, can't find anything"
gaming,"It’s-a-me, the third horseman!"
gaming,Way Better than the (CGI cough cough) live action movie.
gaming,"It probably would cost too much money and time to change, especially at the stage its in. From the tralier, it looks like most of it is done."
gaming,Fitting my entire foot in my mouth
gaming,"Well, it depends on what your preferences are. You likely won't need to upgrade, but if you want framerates higher than 60 get a high refresh rate monitor, and if you want a high resolution, get a high Res monitor, but keep in mind both of these aspects will require a more powerful PC and a more expensive monitor to run at their full potential."
gaming,"Every days, is this an old video?"
gaming,"The hedgehogs in Ferdinand looked better lol

Edit: FYI they were actual hedgehogs lol"
gaming,To her? What? No... it's a sub called r/cosplay dude.
gaming,You completely replaced sonic with another design. A paint over is pointless when you paint over the whole image. Just post a picture of sonic and say “this is what he should look like” and contribute to the Sonic-movie-hate circle jerk that way.
gaming,I've already decided I'm pirating this movie purely as a protest to not give them any money. I want to see it because Sonic but I refuse to let them try to cash in on nostalgia factor but ruin Sonic in the process.
gaming,"They just don't really bother me that much. Think it's a little weird how the blue of his arms continues onto his hands in a chevron, but all in all I'm just like ""Ok.""."
gaming,Seen a 100 posts of the same image claiming it is their work. The internet has not let me down.
gaming,"I enjoyed the open world of Watch Dogs more than the storyline. I liked spying on people by just walking past them, and hacking through security systems to get the layout of an enemy base. But the driving was subpar."
gaming,"Yea, but I bet it's a fuckin' sweet car."
gaming,Garfield could represent the horseman of famine. He eats all the lasagna and everyone else starves
gaming,"It's not hard to do. The artists in Sonic are obviously incredibly talented and the original character design was probably very very similar to this. 

When you see a hideous movie done up really well in 3D like the Sonic trailer is, that's 100% on greedy execs overstepping artists and demanding that ""blue dog should have more fur, give it two discernable eyes please. Make it human"" until the artist just gives up and does everything they say then wants to kill themselves"
gaming,"this isn't for you old fucks. it's for the new generation, the instagram era. this sonic would be snapchatting his new kicks. i can't wait for sonic: the movie: the game to bring in a hole new generation of sonicers"
gaming,The cursed image has been fixed.
gaming,Feel like there needs to be a Zoolander reference here.
gaming,"Local game stores often have groups that welcome players, and you can find people to play with there.  The game store in my area ""around the table"" has dozens of people playing every weekend."
gaming,"The eyes are way too small, arms should be furless and waist should be higher!"
gaming,"Just in general, in both worlds, it's quite quick."
gaming,Keep one round extra for when everything goes to shit.
gaming,"God, this is just this generations mario movie…"
gaming,"Dunno why you are down voted when it's true. My ping is over 120 on it, when I play other games and get less than 40."
gaming,Now I kinda wanna rewatch both of those when I get home
gaming,All the pay-to-play features really break the game.
gaming,It cannot be stopped. It is inevitable.
gaming,That's what she said.
gaming,The live action made his amiibo fat
gaming,\*Wife with her boyfriend
gaming,"Everything you just said more confirms the theory than disproves it.

Why are they so concerned with Sonics' shoes being comically big to the point they would completely alter his entire image?"
gaming,Yeah. And I calculated a multiplicity difference of a million. Hence my comment and the word 'literally'.
gaming,painted blue with little sneakers on. I'd watch that. a little disappointed now
gaming,That title alone is nostalgic.
gaming,"The Muppets have always been a live-action property. The only animated thing they ever had was that short-lived cartoon, so I don't get why you're comparing them to this. 

Also, Muppets 2 flopped hard, so I don't think anyone is trying to copy them."
gaming,I'm not a fan of doing this cause it's basically slapping the artist in the face with critiques they didn't ask for. I had the same thought when they did this to p5r. it's really insulting to the guy who worked hard on it.
gaming,"Where are the core values?/s

But really I love the aesthetic of this. These mashup pictures where all characters are posing are always nice to look at."
gaming,"Holy shit.  Someone is going to burn so hard for this atrocity once they only pull back half of that 90 million, best case scenario."
gaming,"It's ok if he's cartoony, he's from a different planet in this movie!"
gaming,"It literally looks a million times better, and a lot less creepy than the first screenshot"
gaming,I don’t know if you can call caution seaman a game even. But that one. It’s also the creepiest game ever.
gaming,"I love Sonic. But the series is so stale (Mania aside) that I feel a totally new direction is in order. 

I'm not saying this is exactly what I wanted, but why the hell not. Mix it up. Do something new. 

I kinda like the new design.

(Great art though, bud, Nailed it!)"
gaming,"Yea, but you couldn't see each individual tooth...."
gaming,The left looks like a sonic onesie
gaming,That film is a masterpiece
gaming,"Scooby Doo had the cgi of its time, but it was still accurate imo."
gaming,At least we have detective pikachu
gaming,This one sparks joy
gaming,I know I was just saying squirtle wasn't my favorite I liked bulbasaur? I didn't mean it was squirtle I was just saying I didn't like squirtle as much as bulbasaur.
gaming,"That's so unrealistic though.  Everybody knows giant, blue, humanoid, hedgehogs that can run at the speed of light don't have eyes that look like that."
gaming,Only if we can into space.
gaming,"&gt;Knows

I didn’t say they didn’t know about sonic"
gaming,"I'd hope I confirmed the theory rather than disproving it, considering that I was agreeing with you."
gaming,"When you walk into the enemy jungle and slap the Khazix around and ruin his day your having fun.


When the enemy assassin is chasing your ADC and you slap them in place so you and the ADC can kill them, your having fun.


When you are so ahead on udyr you have 4 damage items and righteous glory and run down the enemy ADC and one shot her, your having fun.


When you make an entire lane useless your having fun. 

When your playing Taliyah/Morg and stop an entire go at your team and burst someone down, your laughing your ass off. 

The game can be fun. But it requires the game to be close or you stomping, but not stomping too hard."
gaming,Lego movie game. That is the most broken garbage
gaming,"*Sticks fingers in ears*

A LA LA A LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LAAAAAAAA"
gaming,"It's an adaptation, things are going to be different. It doesn't have to look exactly the same way it does in the game, it **does** have to look better than a mutated child in a suit."
gaming,"unfortunately, my dude, no one cares"
gaming,"They should have done this, and they made him an alien in the movie so they had no excuse here."
gaming,"But wouldn't that be a genuinely funny idea? I think I'd prefer that, the absurdity of a little blue hedgehog, with snarky dialogue about speed dubbed over, would be really novel, at least"
gaming,"Ah, my bad. I thought I read ""I can't see that being the case""."
gaming,I just bought an xbox to play with my best friend from 4th grade and I haven’t touched the PS4 in months
gaming,"If you get long term payments but you need cash now, call JG Wentworth, 877-CASH-NOW"
gaming,This movie is going to be garbage no matter what the cgi model looks like.
gaming,"Spider-verse had a bunch of visual quirks that I didn't even notice, that made it so beautiful, because the team were obviously in love with the comic book visuals that Spider-verse uses.  


Safe to say that the Sonic film doesn't have that kind of love behind it."
gaming,And just think the person who created the monster in the actual trailer was most likely paid millions of dollars. OP that guy should be you.
gaming,"What if in the movie they go back to sonic’s world and he looks more like this, as to why dr robotnic looks different at the end of the trailer"
gaming,Honestly I would rather see that movie.
gaming,"&gt; My guess is that they wanted to make Sonic more available and friendly to kids

What? That's the whole point of Sonic, lol. He already looks cute and friendly for kids, lol."
gaming,"www.pcpartpicker.com

You pick all your parts, it'll tell you if there any known compatability issues. It also provides links to Amazon/Newegg/etc to buy them.

Look at recommended specs for those games.

In brief, you'll want a high end processor ( current gen i5 or i7; or Ryzen), a motherboard with the matching socket; at minimum 8GB RAM (aim for more), and a decent GPU. (GTX 1080, for example). I'd say you also want 2 storage drives. On SSD for your OS and high performance games, and a large capacity HDD for everything else."
gaming,"If it had gloves I'd say we were as close as could get really. 

White fur on the hands (paws?) Of any animal makes zero sense. Especially where he doesnt have pads or nails otherwise.

Besides! He already has SHOES, ytf couldn't he also have gloves? With as fast as he runs, putting his hands on the ground for the occasional stabilizer, is a legitimate possibility."
gaming,Easy mistake to make :)
gaming,Boom version looks far better than this
gaming,Just the fact that you call it that tells me you're not ready.
gaming,"in the nether it is extremely quick, in the over-world it is faster than it used to be"
gaming,"Idk if it works for live action, but the other one definitely doesn't work for anything, soooo"
gaming,It be like that with gaming consoles - the cycle goes both ways lol
gaming,But then it isn't live action.
gaming,But.. why male models?
gaming,Now we need gloves and oversized shoes and it’s done
gaming,Start with your budget is best bet.
gaming,"Yeah, then again, their recent cartoon versions aren't much better.

I miss the 80s designs."
gaming,"Ok..... so I don't go to gamestop's ever. I dont stay up to date with gaming news, and I dont care about the actual release dates, I like it because I genuinely do not know what games are in the making so seeing this showed me what games are coming out. Sorry for thinking a list of games (that I was unaware of) that are coming out was useful for showing me what games were coming out that I may be interested in. Almighty gaming information lord, please show me the way to enlightenment so that I may always know every game in production without needing to actively follow gaming news. If you have a problem with me liking to have a ""little handy list"" of games that are coming out, then you are worthless."
gaming,Why does it look like Dr. Sues produced the movie?
gaming,"&gt; a bit rusty on my painting
OK buddy"
gaming,Anyone send this guy to work in the movie plz.
gaming,It's like [Crazy Cravings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeycomb_(cereal)#Crazy_Craving) made it with a member of the [Blue Man Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Man_Group).
gaming,"I don't know, that could look incredibly weird unless they go the roger rabbit routine and don't make him look real."
gaming,"Nostalgia sells, I guess. I'm not saying the new design is good, but can no one experiment anymore because it would ruin your nostalgia?"
gaming,"No....no it isn't. That would look so fucking disgusting and out of place in a live action world...

Maybe for a cartoon..."
gaming,Have Jim Carrey live action and everything else CG.Show how he brutally enslaved cute animals in his mechs. That woulda been better IMO.
gaming,"My Walmart actually does have this as well. Definitely a different location. It's probably in more than a few locations

Been there for almost a year now."
gaming,Never heard of “ice cancer” before. Can you elaborate on what that one does?
gaming,Let it inevitably flop. Then hopefully whoever or responsible gets the boot.
gaming,"-&gt; Username has ""God"" and ""gamer""

-&gt; Posts 2009 meme

-&gt; That comment

It all checks out. He's redarter."
gaming,What if they make Sonic look normal on his homeworld? Hmm.
gaming,"I have 7 younger cousins ranging from 2 to 10 who all live quite close to me.

Why would they be fans of sonic when no major sonic media has released in years that wasn’t called mediocre at best?"
gaming,"This is so much better, nice job"
gaming,Yeah. He makes pretty damn good Tacos.
gaming,"I just don't understand why they decided to make him some kind of human hybrid. He's a fucking hedgehog, just stick with the damn source material, lol."
gaming,Alita and Sonic must've teleported together. Their eyes got switched...
gaming,Unpopular Opinion: I thought it sucked. Why have two swords? I'm pretty sure if I stabbed a regular guy with a Silver sword he'd stop being alive.
gaming,"Jim Carrey is literally perfect for the roll of Robotnik. The bug I have against it is the character design, much like that of Sonic, is atrocious. I feel like if they designed those two better than it would be a much better movie without even changing the story."
gaming,Thats awesome. This is a small detail that means a lot to me. I always loved the name Robotnik and recent Sonic games led me to believe that history was erased.
gaming,This whole movie looks so 2001
gaming,Tabletop sim is basically designed for this.
gaming,"For good reason, you've got your title gore, posted in the wrong sub, almost zero attempt at cosplay, etc."
gaming,"It's pretty great. If you play it right, which is very fast small turns the game goes really quickly. It's like Catan and Risk put into one game. But it takes players who are willing to play and focus, or else it take forever to play. In my play group turns are about 15 seconds each."
gaming,Wow they need to hire him to rework the sonic movie.
gaming,"It's not the rendering that's the hard part.  It's the modeling, animating, and producing."
gaming,I edited it 😓
gaming,I find the fog way too strong. Can't see through it but the enemies can see me just fine from miles away. Not cool.
gaming,Who thought it would be better to make Sonic look like a 8 year old in a furry-suite? Who do they have to make him look like a kid in a costume when he is aleeady CGI?
gaming,Is there more to life than being really really really ridiculously good looking?
gaming,Haven’t played both but I’m pretty confident map knowledge is a much bigger part of R6.
gaming,"See this is fine until he starts moving around.  How would you describe his ""skin""?  He almost looks like he has seal skin with how reflective it would be."
gaming,My biggest issue are his eyes. They’re not fucking round
gaming,This is so much better
gaming,"Yes, that is the idea. This version is swimming in the uncanny valley."
gaming,"&gt;Jesus christ, what is that?

It's a yeti-human hybrid formed in the flesh pits of Outworld. There is no other explanation."
gaming,"'God' is a title, which 'God' ? Big man kinda looks like Zeus."
gaming,"/r/helpmebuildapc Has lots of guides and helpful people that will get you set up and goin pretty quickly. /r/buildapc is also good, but better more for when you know what you're doing a bit."
gaming,Obviously Scooby Doo was unrealistic. There's no way to realistically show even 1% of Shaggy's true form.
gaming,"It’s a joke. Good Dark Souls players way of avoiding damage is to roll around. So in PvP you will see someone swing a weapon and then his opponent will start rolling around since it gives invulnerability frames, and try to get behind them. Then when the roller attacks the other person will roll. Rinse and repeat till someone misses timing."
gaming,How could have they failed so much?
gaming,Snoc te hoogpia he can run at semi nominal pace.
gaming,Its also a relic of human civilization. That movie was so bad it was good. Dare I say *perfect*.
gaming,"The fur is not the problem for me, its just how he looks. The pokemon in the pikachu movie look great...what they did to sonic however...."
gaming,Haha porter auto! I know what state this was taken in..
gaming,This why can't they do this
gaming,Left is a furry
gaming,He looks like a dude in a fur suit
gaming,"Kids almost never care about quality only if it entertains them, well from my experience at least. They just want to have fun and laugh at dumb loud shit"
gaming,"You know, i wouldn't be suprised if through the movie he ended up getting some fort of visor or glasses that gave him the classic eye look. We allready know the transform robotnik into what we know at the end, maybe that what they will do with sonic. Probably not but it keeps my hopes up."
gaming,"Is no one going to say anything about the idea of ""clicking"" an analog button?"
gaming,"But i said they were entrances to special stages. But they never were exactly rooted in canon.

Though only once, in Sonic 3 locked into Sonic &amp; Knuckles cartridge Knuckles indeed uses big ring to go into hidden palace and you follow him, but i doubt they dug that deep."
gaming,Honestly now that you mention it I wanna see another Seuss classic get made into a movie
gaming,why do you incels care so much about a movie for little kids?
gaming,I came here for the same answers
gaming,"Yes that's Sonic, but isn't that too cartoony to work in live action? I'm not disputing that the horseshit one they've gone with isn't right, but this isn't either."
gaming,I mean a 3d cartoon in real world wouldn't hurt anyone.
gaming,The difference is that Katawa Shoujo is actually good
gaming,"Ya he's pretty out of it,  my favorite is Alistar just poking around the corner haha"
gaming,To be honest. I didn't hate the design until the human teeth.
gaming,"Hey guys, do you like the Sonic design in the new movie? Or do you think it would be better this way? Because I haven't seen enough posts yet saying so. Just don't see the movie if you think it looks bad Jesus Christ."
gaming,"Yeah, he never looked high."
gaming,"In the first one, you can get a guy to dress in green and act tho"
gaming,This is titanfall 2
gaming,"Black is always a good color for the PlayStation granted the first PlayStation was grey but cmon it was the first PlayStation the makers only cared about the console not its appearance, just the kind of people who want to give life a bit more fun. Thank you Sony :)"
gaming,Maybe in live action the single eye and big head would have been a little much
gaming,"This experiment went hella wrong, the new pikachu didn't ruin my nostalgia.. This is just sooo bad it doesn't do Sonic any justice. Personally just what I think."
gaming,"Right? I still find myself enjoying it as a teen today. The first one at least, second was alright, but the prequels or whatever...ugh"
gaming,Definitely over a hundred bucks
gaming,great work. now do one for every single frame of the movie.
gaming,I bet they have someone doing mocap for sonic and it was just easier to rig Sonic's model to match that person's body so they wouldn't need as many animators to fix things in post. They just assumed no one would give a shit.
gaming,"I don't think ""esports arena"" cares about a single thing outside of corporate sponsorships."
gaming,And he used it contextually reverse.
gaming,Are people upset because of the small eyes? I really don't get it
gaming,"It is better than the crap they put out for the movie, but Sonic still isn't that great of a character or game series. Even if they 100% had stayed true to the characters in the game (following something like Detective Pikachu's lead), he would still be this sub-par character with stupid quips, non-sensical storyline, and guitar solos. It's not like this shitty adaption is tarnishing this already-amazing character.

&amp;#x200B;

It's weird though, given that they had almost total creative freedom to make Sonic look however they wanted him to, since he was going to be CGI regardless, that they went the direction that they went. Previously, adaptations of characters were bound by whatever physical costume they could put together or actors that were available, but in this instance, there was almost nothing stopping them from just creating an almost identical CGI, live-action version of Sonic. Yet they chose the shittiest option available. At least Super Mario Bros had the excuse that quality CGI graphics weren't available and they just had to make do with what they had."
gaming,It's a broken link the thumbnail is a block on the side of a building that looks like it doesn't belong. The link is broken and directing clicks to a shirt. You're way over thinking a simple repost.
gaming,Id say a dollar AT LEAST
gaming,They need to hire you. The left one is nightmare fuel.
gaming,your down voted by im also confused how its an asset swap when the assets are different.
gaming,I don't agree but can I get downvotes too
gaming,"That’s why they watch Peppa Pig and Spongebob. Sonic is never run on TV, why would they be fans of it?"
gaming,ET looks like there was a lot more work done on him back in the day.
gaming,"I press a until you select yes to heal then mash B while looking out the car window, Goodtimes."
gaming,I’m at the airport. Guess I’ll fap in the plane
gaming,It's funny seeing how critical everyone is of the art direction like this is going to be a good movie. It's clearly going to be terrible regardless of how they animated him.
gaming,how long will it be until they start rendering movies like this with multiple different skins that viewers can put on the characters for an extra $1.99?
gaming,To make her ass more prominent.
gaming,Alita I think was 180 million. And that one was mixed live action and CG
gaming,That actually sounds like it could legitimately be a plot out of *Sonic Boom*.
gaming,That just reminded me of being 7 and now I want to cry.
gaming,"It's not even close to the same, but I've been loving OK Golf on my phone recently.  It's not free, but there's no ads and it's actually a really good time. Green physics are a little wonky to make putting easier I think, it takes some getting used to if you're used to simulation putting, but it's a great time-waster."
gaming,My team fucks me enough.
gaming,Who cares how he looks like if the movie will suck anyway?
gaming,WHEN WILL YOU LEARN THAT YOUR ACTION HAVE CONSEQUENCES?
gaming,"I’ve just started playing Doom, didn’t think it’d be something that I’d like based on what I normally play but I’m really enjoying it! Just find the 3D map really confusing 😂"
gaming,Left is a guy in a fur suit. Right is Sonic.
gaming,Even a cheep Chinese ripoff is better than this
gaming,My hand is as white as it was before i got it tattooed minus some leftover ink. You really cant tell i was ever tat. But yeah artist wont tell you its not worth and that it wont last lmao.
gaming,Now I hope this movie opens with a 10 minute artistic justification explanation of why they animated Sonic the way they did.
gaming,Would thia design work from all angles?
gaming,Sonic Boom still gets reruns and youtube exists.
gaming,Actually I'm pretty sure that's what they based the movie Sonic off of
gaming,There is no balance here.
gaming,"If you are gonna spend $20M on CGI, is it really worth it to spend a full $1000 to give them source material?!"
gaming,"Best one i've seen yet.   That's actually sonic,  not sonic in a skin suit."
gaming,"It depends on how they made the movie.

In theory they could ""just"" change his model and re-use the old animations. Some scenes would need tweaking for sure. The main question is how much it costs to render everything that sonic did again and redo or tweak any special effects that were based on the old footage."
gaming,Of course there's an equal chance that they haven't thought any of this through.
gaming,Tounge but hole skeleton!
gaming,Why is this better then the MOVIE CGI PROFESSIONALS
gaming,Why are people obsessed with what sonic looks like?
gaming,"It looks better, but it doesn't change the fact the the plot is that of a terrible 80s buddy cop film."
gaming,Now there is the sonic I know and love!
gaming,This is kinda better.
gaming,"Okay so you don’t go to game stores , you don’t keep up with game info , you don’t keep up with game news , and you are “ too lazy” to look up stuff online ( but you have time to spend on reddit ) so if you don’t do any of the aforementioned things then how is your “ cute widdle paper ( toddler voice ) “ any benefits to you . It has literally no relevant info in regards to release dates. That paper is for preorders to the game stop store which you said you don’t go into so again it’s of no benefit to you . Lmao that paper is worthless and you act like it’s fucking gold , you’re an idiot at best ."
gaming,So many people have made edits that look so much better. So how did they mess it up that badly if it was so easy?
gaming,"Well, she's Brazilian. So technically, OP is right. Even if we didn't ask for her to be categorized like we're on RedTube or something.

She's [Maria Fernanda Galvao](http://www.adventuresinpoortaste.com/2018/07/21/the-maria-fernanda-galvao-cosplay-collection/), by the way.

@fegalvao on IG. Not that I had it memorized or anything."
gaming,Reverse the order and you get mitosis
gaming,The left one makes me think of a bad porn parody of the right one
gaming,a million times better
gaming,"I wouldn't say the Chipmunks looked pretty similar, they fucked that one up pretty hardcore too."
gaming,reminds me of a scene in z nation when a business had “Closed for busin...” with a paint/blood smear at the end
gaming,"I had no idea this game came out!  I've been looking forward to it, how are you liking it so far?"
gaming,"His design is pretty funny when you stop and look at it.  Giant head twice as big as his body, with crazy long legs.  Tiny elongated bean for a nose.  One giant eye with two floating pupils and a weird brow that pulls down over the center.  Spikes/quills that clump into triangular formations.  All that, and the only things he wears are shoes and gloves.

It's no wonder they failed at trying to make him look real.  Way better to embrace his cartoonity than to fight it."
gaming,Where's this perfect man? I don't see Ricardo.
gaming,"&gt;They’re being dicks because they post this on the wrong sub. This sub is made for gaming, only gaming, not for cosplay, there’s other places for that.

And the cosplay was terrible. This whole post is messed up."
gaming, Notice how there is still fur textures
gaming,Annoys me how they capitalized Velociraptors but not Dysentery
gaming,Still waiting for Pikmin 4?
gaming,An image so cursed people started downvoting as a reflex lol
gaming,That second one with sexy Velma made me feel things.
gaming,Where does once get said shirt? That's awesome!
gaming,Because on the left it’s easier to render having a guy in a CGI suit act it out than that on the righg
gaming,this is something i'm willing to see
gaming,"My thoughts exactly, no discredit to to the artist, but with the cartoon design I just can’t un-see that weird, giant ass eyeball with with two pupils..."
gaming,Have to reshoot everything I presume that’s not entirely digitally rendered; there is no background where the former character model is.
gaming,No one knows at this point
gaming,"When was the last decade ""Jim Carrey"" was a big box office name?"
gaming,Can you repeat the question?
gaming,You care enough to make a comment. You could have scrolled past if you didn't care.
gaming,That could probably turn out better than this
gaming,"It's the eyes, and the human mouth, the weird torso shape, the lack of gloves leading to creepy looking hands and the weirdly muscular legs that don't fit with the rest of his body. They went too far trying to make him look human."
gaming,I met keira metz and liked her and then i met Triss and loved her even more.  Triss is hard to beat and shes a sweetheart
gaming,I thought orgies were like an orgy for your eyes.
gaming,"I felt like he's playing up the ""ace Ventura"" style way to hard to be honest. I'd be fine with him looking nothing like Eggman if he acted like the character."
gaming,I ain't seen nuthin.
gaming,"I don’t think that’s a thing that happened. I might be wrong. But something tells me that if they Yoda’d ET there’s have been a fucking *riot*, and I didn’t get an invite to an E.t. Riot"
gaming,Probably face capturing software worked better this way.
gaming,"The wanted to make him more human looking. It will help sell costumes and cosplay crap. They also thought “realism” meant giving him a more human body type. 

It was a group of people who clearly didn’t feel comfortable objecting to one morons bad ideas. Looking at you Neal Moritz, who also produced Fast and Furious.

It doesn’t matter because the Asian market has EXTREMELY low standards (they love the Grown Up films with Adam Sandler) so they will love this crap, and make it a success. Despite being hated here, there will be numerous sequels. It’s sucks that Hollywood is able to regress like this by catering to a massive market of people with low standards."
gaming,The two things that bother me most are the lack of gloves with those furry little hands and those surprisingly human but at the same time inhuman looking teeth.
gaming,"I dunno man, rigs 6 and 8 look like fucking beasts, I like the touch of having drinks in there to illustrate how cool they are.  Must have like 6 graphics cards in each!"
gaming,"I'm amazed that a bunch of internet nobodies already made dozens of better looking Sonic's. Remwbwr, if you see this abortion you're a traitor. We can not let them get away with this nonsense."
gaming,It’s a mix. There a intermittent sequences of live action mixed in.
gaming,wtf this is so good
gaming,Is this the 90's?
gaming,"His eyes arent touching, yet it still looks amazing, proof it was possible"
gaming,Imagine danny devito as robotnik tho
gaming,Spooky how good it is
gaming,"At least the got the nose and ears right. Oh and the color, they got the color right"
gaming,Still better than what they went with.
gaming,Okay there we go. This guy deserves to be paid.
gaming,"You know it :).

Works well and easily. I always had issues getting the multiplayer working on the originals back in 1995 or whenever, but we didn't have issues with openra.

It's all free and open source so you can check it out without any investment."
gaming,I don't think you're a simple gamer if you play HoI4
gaming,Used 2ds XL from GameStop and maybe a few games?
gaming,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
gaming,"Doubt it, Illumination in France who does Despicable Me, Life of Pets, and a whole lot of other beautiful full CGI films is turning them out with budgets under $80M which is actually insane.

There's no way this abortion cost less than $100M based on what I'm looking at so far in the trailer.

I've done VFX work for the Resident Evil franchise with budgets in that neighborhood and they had less production value and a way worse cast than this Sonic movie."
gaming,I wonder if everybody would have been happier with like a DreamWorks style animated film instead. Sonic and realistic looking humans has never worked well.
gaming,"Try dota, it's better and not a rip off of dota."
gaming,This is what they should have done
gaming,a BiT rUsTy oN My pAinTinG
gaming,YOU’RE NOT THE BOSS OF ME NOW
gaming,"Ah, Dalek Sec at the end there."
gaming,"I disagree about the Smurfs, the live-action movies really butchered them in my opinion. Those two movies are shameful adaptations of Peyo's timeless creation."
gaming,"Woah, just realized that sonic has one giant eye with 2 pupils. imagine the size of the eyeball in his head."
gaming,I love it 3000
gaming,I think the intention with the recent cartoon version was to differentiate them. And also make it so they aren't all the same species of turtle.
gaming,Conan Exiles has some issues right now for me (PS4). Probably would be far better on PC. I feel like they barely tried to optimize for console.
gaming,It doesnt matter who made it...
gaming,I love it 3000
gaming,Nah detective Pikachu actually looks decent lol. I think sonic animated in the human world makes more sense. The Pokémon movie makes sense cause it’s the world of Pokémon but I just hate sonic.
gaming,"Haha that's awesome! My daughters first game alone was Skyrim ""8 years old"", I've got months worth of memories watching her figure it out and become a master lol I actually just went this am and picked her up her own switch and botw. I'm stupidly excited for this lol"
gaming,"Honestly they should have made Dr Robotic cgi too, they are basically the two main characters anyway and Carrey looks nothing like him, he's not even fat"
gaming,Isn't this hypocritical. We praise Detective Pikachu and diss Sonic's CGI.
gaming,I think we will see a lot more movies like spiderverse. It has shown mainstream producers/directors what is possible with animation.
gaming,"So basically with this edit and the other one posted, we have learned it is not that they can't make him look great, it is that they hate us."
gaming,"To redesign with new proportions means an entirely new rig, animation done mostly from scratch, barring some technical solution to transfer animation between rigs and finesse them, but even then, his stride is a different distance, he's too short to interact with things properly like he did, many shots would still need to be fixed, retimed, or completely redone, including changes to characters interacting with him, eye direction, reshooting those scenes potentially where actors interact with him, cameras reframed to work with a drastically different character height. Potentially other assets sonic uses redesigned for new scale. And then rerender every frame he's in all over again. For a feature length movie, would most likely end up setting the production back 4-8 months and cost a good 5-20 million dollars give or take.

Obviously these figures are still estimates based on minimal knowledge of the movies overall budget and complexity. Based on working in fx and animation for the last 10 years."
gaming,"That may be true, but you can't change what other people do. You can only change yourself. So if you don't buy in, great, but it's still a problem. Not because of you, but because of other people who do buy."
gaming,Keira ended up with that one dude in the end though. He needed some happiness in his life
gaming,What is it with current designers and making characters hideous? Detective Pikachu has some ugly characters but it passes..
gaming,Definitely couldn’t use those eyes.  They would be worse than the ones in the actual movie.  Everything else looks good though
gaming,If you look at the trailer Carrey turns into the Robotnik that we are more familiar with at some point in the movie. It's only Sonic's design that's garbage.
gaming,"""more like a hedgehog""

yes, the character on the left is clearly the spitting image of a tiny spiky potato"
gaming,Maybe a DS? How old is the kid?
gaming,Truly the darkest timeline
gaming,"Fire Emblem Heroes,
the game is really generous and you can freely advance through the story and the extra events without even paying a cent.
There's also Dragalia Lost. Haven't played DL but heard good things bout it.
You can also try Langrisser Mobile.
And don't forget Phantasy Star Classics and Shining Force Classics, both collections having 3 games of their respective series for FREE."
gaming,Reminds me of what they did with the [Ninja Turtles](https://statici.behindthevoiceactors.com/behindthevoiceactors/_img/chars/michelangelo-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-out-of-the-shadows-4.02.jpg). Seems to be a Paramount thing.
gaming,The’s remakes don’t matter until they can animate the picture.
gaming,They can’t be fucking serious. Like what is that? You would expect the people designing Sonic would know what sonic looks like.
gaming,I just don’t understand why they didn’t give him white racing gloves or something. His movie design is monumentally lazy. It’s like they made him look like shit on purpose
gaming,"The scenes are already there. I imagine re-modeling Sonic would be a fraction of the work that the entire movie already has been, but you still have to dedicate time and resources to re-rendering all of those scenes. Time is money and missing release schedules can mean millions of dollars in lost revenue.

Disclaimer, this is out of my realm. I can do engineering modeling, design and FEA simulations but this is a whole new beast I'm not entirely familiar with."
gaming,I want a copy of Playlad
gaming,"And let's cast Will Smith as sonic, I hear he still hasnt been able to wash off the blue paint from playing Genie"
gaming,"One of the big problem with all these artist renders is that they're just drawings. They're not animated or required to be set in a real world. Obviously the Sonic look is awful, but just slapping together a drawing and saying ""look how much better I can do"" ignores all the factors you have to consider when creating a CGI character, which has to move and interact with real people. They could obviously go in a Roger Rabbit direction and make it look however they want, but that clearly wasn't their intended direction. I'm not endorsing the version we have by any means, I'm just tired of people acting like designing a CGI character is so simple."
gaming,"It has been a long while since I played, but I recall disliking the limited weapon choices and how quickly all weapons were unlocked."
gaming,We absolutely did not let TMNT slide.
gaming,Really? their sister stores in Canada (eb games) puts a seal over the case of used games so you can only return it if you havent played it - and avoid any perpetual rental schemes.
gaming,I honestly thought it was a painting.
gaming,video game movies are cursed. I don't even think they could fuck it up this badly if *tried.*
gaming,"It has benefit to me because I can now think about with games I will want to buy. I am a budget gamer so I have to pick and choose. I didnt dig deep for this reddit post it was right on top of my feed. Why do internet douchebags like you feel the need to be complete and utter dicks for no reason? I saw a list of games coming out, didnt know about pretty much any of them and got excited only to have you call me an idiot and a child simply for liking this list of games. You are the worst kind of person. Stop trying to act like you are some sort of intelligent being, because people who are actually intelligent do not feel the need to call others stupid for self validation. You sir can fuck off."
gaming,It wouldn’t be the first time cartoony characters mingled with live action. It may not be a perfect fit but I might have been willing to pay money to see the movie if it looked like this
gaming,"No no, I'm right xD
I don't remember where he started, but it's just some green and white, and shades of peachy orange."
gaming,"If the movie is good, it doesn't matter what he looks like.

If the movie is bad, it doesn't matter how many times people suggested their design fixes."
gaming,Why couldn't they just make it look like it was from the actual game
gaming,I’d try online too like maybe eBay might me cheaper on there
gaming,Just like in the movies
gaming,"It just makes me think of Role Models.

""You white, you Ben Affleck."""
gaming,It's actually more costly to integrate and make CGI look good with live action than just to do everything in CG.
gaming,At this point they should have just made an animated film
gaming,People get upset when other people don't do the same shit again and again and again.
gaming,They done fucked up big time.
gaming,"I dunno, that looked pretty damn good to me. Thought it was gorgeous even and not jarring at all. Even Eggman's design looked great. Just without the human to hedgehog romance though."
gaming,Is it just me or this post have no upvotes if yes then why?
gaming,"Timetravel,, that way yout hype is bigger.."
gaming,I'm down for that
gaming,Yeah what the fuck was I thinking? I have no idea
gaming,"I tried so hard, and got so far. :c"
gaming,All I see is a question mark in a box.
gaming,I think alao punisher mixed in with those also.
gaming,"Don't freak out when you die and lose a bunch of souls/die on your way back and they're gone forever. It's actually pretty liberating to know that you have nothing to lose, and it reduces some of the pressure of trying a boss over and over. 

EXPLORE. Seriously, way more than you think you need to - the souls games are excellent at hiding paths where it looks like a dead end.  It's like they're scientifically designed to make you miss certain things the first time you go through an area, you have to really check every corner and kill every enemy in an area if you want to find *all* the stuff/secrets."
gaming,Now do the same to Pikachu.
gaming,I see what you did there.
gaming,"Sonic Boom Sonic isn't really that bad... I can understand not liking the show, but he looks just like a taller [Sonic](https://renewcanceltv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SB.jpg)"
gaming,Reddit users always assume internet comments are serious. Always.
gaming,"My theory is they are going to tell this origin story:

https://blog.vrv.co/aitchison/3952/reading-the-old-testament-of-sonic-the-hedgehog/

That comics is based on the origin story of ""The Sonic Bible"" created by Sega of America. I guess Sega of America is behind the movie.

In the comics, Sonic apparently reaches the [Sonic Boom](https://youtu.be/FvvZaBf9QQI?t=34) at 760mph, the same speed on the cop's speed gun [in the trailer](https://youtu.be/FvvZaBf9QQI?t=5).

Maybe this is why we are seeing a shitty Sonic and (hopefully) he will turn into a good looking Sonic we know, just like [Jim Carrey](https://i.redd.it/g635lhkchav21.jpg) turns into a [fat bald Eggman](https://i.imgur.com/Bp9rKYA.png)."
gaming,Yeah. I once invited him over to mine for diamonds. Turns out that phrase has two meanings.
gaming,He looks too human on the left
gaming,They didn't get the nose or color right.
gaming,He looks like the Jumanji kid when he turned into a monkey
gaming,"In all of my extensive travels through the America's, I have never once encountered someone identifying as a Latina who is as pale as the above, including one with achromasia, you slack jawed pedant."
gaming,He looks like they took a Who-mask from the Grinch props and turned the footage in to partial CGI and called it a day.
gaming,"A blue hedgehog with shoes and the fur is what has you ""like what?"""
gaming,Is it worth paying full price for?
gaming,"Good luck. You are gonna need it. 

You are confusing terms. But to each their own. I mean it is a racing game after all so its not like there will be a lot of hype or rage if something isnt as it should be.

Many people run tournaments. And most of them are really bad. But again good luck."
gaming,I'd recommend PS Vita. A great handheld console and probably the best for kids who like gaming but also streaming on the devices and just using them for everything
gaming,"I'm talking just in the scope of sonic himself, not the movie.  I'm saying most of the work on sonic and only sonic is not the rendering phase.  That's really the least expensive part, since it's just waiting for some computers to spit out what all the work has gone into making.  It would be one thing if they were just changing his textures or something, but the redesign would have a totally different model and skeleton, so you are basically starting from the beginning again."
gaming,I’ll have to re watch it I assume. But who framed roger rabbit still stands😂😂
gaming,Fake advertising is a norm for mobile games
gaming,Man the guy who animated the movie Sonic must feel so shitty right now
gaming,Seriously...the original looks like a kid in a onesie
gaming,Why does belgium have so many missiles?
gaming,Never played the game but that animated series was my childhood for a bit.
gaming,Ok the ears then..
gaming,They've helped thousands theyll help you too
gaming,Now this i would go see
gaming,This looks bad too imo. This character just shouldn’t have been brought to live action lmao
gaming,"Producers: It's too good. Can you make it look less like Sonic and more like a deformed blue hairy child, please?"
gaming,He looks like a very good furry
gaming,"ok guys, just pretend like you wouldn't totally say how out of place a cartoon sonic is with real humans if they'd used the original design from the start.

Like honestly, do you think they could have done anything to make an audience happy with a live action sonic?"
gaming,Bet it was SUPER fun (for the other three dude).
gaming,"Him: ""Sandstorm is super good. Especially the sounds.""

You: ""I disagree, it's not that good. Sounds are amazing though  and it's still really good""

Insurgency has by far the best sound design. But it lags a lot. It's not a super casual game, but it's also very instanced/closed-world compared to the milsim ""hardcore"" games. And no one takes Push seriously, there's not much benefit to communication outside of competitive. It's definitely my favorite right now, but I have no idea what I'd place as top all time."
gaming,And the human teeth...
gaming,"Lisa the Painful. 

Who knew RPG maker and a free FL studio trial could create one of the most heart ripping games I've ever played."
gaming,"It doesn't matter in the end... Sonic looks awful - but even if he looked good, the film is gonna suck. It's a classic 'cartoony character from another universe enters ours by a portal and has a goofy human sidekick help him in his adventures and ends up going through crazy hijinx together' sort of movie."
gaming,"You can cheat it, the same way they cheat Mickey's ears"
gaming,"I think it's because many of our furry friends have white ""hands""/paws and it's kind of cute. I really didn't notice his hands much int he trailer, or his shoes really. It's his face and body that weird me out."
gaming,That's a lot better
gaming,"tbh its probably gonna kill video game movies for a long time, just like DOOM did, even though DOOM was great"
gaming,I don’t get why people are so upset about the way he looks. The movie is going to be terrible either way.
gaming,Now I know who's got all my passwords.
gaming,"I may not be upvoted, but I'm a man of my word, if nothing else.

OH YEAH, SNAP INTO A SLIM JIM, YEAHHH!"
gaming,"I heard that Eminem was in talks to do a GTA movie in like 2008, but nothing ever came of it. This was right after 8 Mile came out, so it kinda made sense then, but definitely would't make sense now. 

It's a mistake, unless they told the story *from* one of the games, it would just be a ""crime movie""."
gaming,The way they animated sonic in the trailer makes me fear for my ass. Live action sonic fucks. And he doesn't ask.
gaming,This game still a development nightmare?
gaming,"Ah yes, editing a single frame, how brave and heroic. 


Now animate the whole movie."
gaming,Now to hold plant a bomb at the all star hockey game in attempt to finally kill Scarn
gaming,Has he tried turning the table? Like literally?
gaming,Imagine getting paid to design the monstrosity that made the final cut
gaming,Yeah if they actually did this then people would be complaining about how they didn't even try.
gaming,"If the movie is good, it doesn't matter what he looks like.

If the movie is bad, it doesn't matter if they went ahead and accepted any of these ""fixes."""
gaming,This is how it should of been
gaming,"Fuck yeah rocky and bullwinkle, I loved that shit as a kid.

That Kenan and Kel cameo tho."
gaming,No it’s the hands and feet. And teeth. And most of it all.
gaming,"He looked nothing like a hedgehog originally. Like, nothing like one. 

He looks more like a hedgehog in this film"
gaming,"Only one thing to do, buy a playstation. ^^^^^This ^^^^^is ^^^^^a ^^^^^joke"
gaming,"If it were a real hedgehog and they went all Milo and Otis with it, I'd watch that movie."
gaming,I feel like they are trying to get some sort of Academy Award for design or something. Something about this feels like it's not made for the audience.
gaming,"I figured putting it caps would make people realize it, because who would be dumb enough to actually think that. Don't answer that...I already have a friend like that."
gaming,This is where it starts... good natured and intentioned. Soon we will start getting the furry art and sonic diaper toilet art.
gaming,"This one from twitter is a great mix of original and update

https://i.imgur.com/ogrVCRo.jpg"
gaming,If it was a video game that won't be an issue. Just swap models. But not a movie.
gaming,You mean fuckin veird
gaming,Has anyone compared it to when the kid in Jumanji turned into a monkey?
gaming,Quality shitpost right here
gaming,"Wow, looks fuckin stupid in context.... imagine that?"
gaming,I am surprised because there is one dedicated to Jessica Nigri.
gaming,"It's so stupid that all these people are making these drawings of sonic. I get it you can draw sonic, what does it have to do with anything? Not to say the trailer version is not ugly, but come on, you're not even being original and proposing your own idea, you're just taking an already existing image and draw it, that's not impressive.    
And also, CGI =/= drawing."
gaming,"Crap, that might actually be a solution to the monstrosity in the film. It's a long shot but it showed bald eggman at the end so maybe sonic gets gloves and goggles to complete his look during the course of the film"
gaming,"I am almost positive there are algo's in place that every decision tha was made to make this movie is perfect from a marketing standpoint. 

That is, there is no soul and and no artistic vision. 

Its live action so they can flex star power and not do a fully CGI movie which be very costly.


And in that regards, a normal sonic would be too hard to animate. He would look dead so give him more human features that is far less expressive and far cheaper to do."
gaming," Very good, the white stomach still annoys me cause it’s not the same as the under chin thingy. But otherwise this is so much better thanks lol"
gaming,The worst part for me is the fact that he has human teeth. That’s what genuinely unsettles me
gaming,Okay now do every other frame
gaming,The delightful sensation when you walk by feet into a tiberium field.
gaming,"Who Framed Roger Rabbit? I know that is a different film, but they could have done a Sonic film similar to that. Make it cartoony."
gaming,[Esports Arena Opens Venues Inside Walmart Stores](https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/esports-arena-opens-walmart-venues-1203024499/)

gaming,Was it a rights issue regarding artist?  Is sonic and every iteration owned by one company?
gaming,"Now that it looks good, can a writer looks over the script once it's out there and change it up too? I doubt it'll be good, compared to the trend of events so far"
gaming,Movie sonic looks like the grinch fucked a smurf
gaming,"PLOT TWIST: paramount purposefully made sonic look like a nightmare come true in this trailer to create all this attention, and then release the final movie with a more appealing model like this one"
gaming,"I suppose it depends on how tight your budget is.  I think so.  You'll get at the very least 60 hours of play out of it if you only play through the main quests, so that's less than a dollar an hour.  My squad varies, but most of the guys I've played with since beta have between 300 to 800 hours in at this point, so mileage varies."
gaming,"The real money is in the merch, and kids will likely eat this up and hound their parents for merch. This movie is 100% for the new generation, not for fans of the franchise."
gaming,"One hypothesis I read (that honestly makes too much sense) is that Nike wanted the character proportioned in a way that made the shoes look best. After reworking the model in a way that best fit the corporate sponsor's interests, the conventional Sonic form looked even more awkward than the... thing we got."
gaming,Have you seen Who Framed Roger Rabbit? There's toons everywhere and it just works.
gaming,"Magicka 2 and Helldivers are both from the same developer and both tough, especially Magicka 2 because there's a bit of ability-overload (you combine elements to make spells to cast, there's 8 elements and 5 combo slots, so the amount of spells is almost too much to focus on - very cool magic system).  

Cuphead is great and pretty challenging."
gaming,Your brother stood with your father...
gaming,The body totally looks like they molded it so they could mocap easily without deforming too much. It looks like a guy in a suite with a giant CGI head. Which I'm sure is what they did to keep costs down from having to CGI the whole thing.
gaming,The new generation have already seen Sonic in the Wreck It Ralph movies.
gaming,"They would need to change the model, maybe a lot of fixing on the animations, could result in having to change complete scenes. It would take some time, having to change the model and review the whole thing to make sure everything works..."
gaming,"You mean, like Detective Pikachu?"
gaming,They saw him exactly once while walking through an arcade.
gaming,This... does put a smile on my face
gaming,I never really appreciated how weird and furry-like that weird movie Sonic was until this... Ya it's fuckin creepy.
gaming,"Yeah but if Sonic looks good, then the movie might actually be good. We don't want that."
gaming,I would honestly accept the original genesis sprite.
gaming,"Disclaimer: I didn't see the second one, but the first of the recent movies while hard to look at, did have a decent story. Mostly the thing I liked about it is that the turtles weren't all identical size and features. TBH though, I think I only liked it because I went in expecting to be supremely disappointed and left thinking it was entertaining enough."
gaming,when companies want to relevant to the kids... (left) but what the *kids* want
gaming,"Someone said it's likely why Sonic looks like that too.

They probably didn't want to pay proper animators, so they just put a guy in a mo-cop suit instead -- then tweaked Sonic's design to work with a man's proportions."
gaming,"But that's now just a cartoon.

I get that the end result of what they did sucks, but this just sucks in a different way.  The point is to have a CGI, more realistic version of Sonic, not to just draw Sonic in as a cartoon character beside humans."
gaming,"So did they not focus test it with kids then? Because what we see is an uncanney valley breaching monster that isn't cute in a somewhat boring world. 

Same thing happened with Attack of the clones where it was clearly made for kids but they placed it in a boring government world where they spent way to long talking about silly governances and trade embargoes. 

It's a really weird mistake to make in the modern world of demographic targeted media. We'll see if the story itself makes up for it, but there just being a furry monstrosity in it doesn't make it a fun kid's watch."
gaming,"It wouldn't because it classes horribly with real life. It's a better looking sonic for sure but it doesn't mean it fits.

There have been other redesigns that work better overall 


https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/6/18253330/sonic-the-hedgehog-live-action-fan-redesign


Basically just fix the freaking eyes and thin or the legs and its massively better and don't clash worse than the current thing"
gaming,Galak-Z: The Dimensional. It's rogue-like spaceship/mech/transformer game in the style of 80s anime and it's awesome.
gaming,"Played a lot of the N64 version. It was good but all story and cinematics was missing, now with the remake you should give it a try to see the complete content it's great."
gaming,The screenshot is so unsettling. He has human legs; they're not cartoonish enough. They have muscle where humans have muscle. Your version is way better based on that alone.
gaming,It was just yesterdecade.
gaming,"Ofcourse! It makes sense now. The f\*king designer was a furry himself. That's how the model hot a greenlight.

  


Is it this easy to trick a big studio into rendering your fetish these days?"
gaming,Plot twist they’re using free artist edits of the trailer to nail what people really want to see without actually paying anyone to fix it
gaming,"Studio execs.

""We can't do that, it's weirdly proportioned. He doesn't look real. He looks like a cartoon. I want a *real* giant blue alien hedgehog that runs at the speed of sound."""
gaming,"Destiny 2. It's always Destiny 2.

I have 15 other games I haven't even played, and I still play Destiny 2. Lol"
gaming,"I guess Into the Spider-Verse was too recent to influence them, but Hollywood needs to be taking notes that the world doesn't need our favorite childhood characters to only be interacting with the real world. Fully animated is often the best way to go for these characters."
gaming,they just saw a picture of sonic and describe the picture to some1 else
gaming,"Because the Belgium border is on the west and north side of Luxembourg while France is only in the south and germany in the east. Now that I see it, I should have replaced the german flags on top with belgium flags because of that."
gaming,ok well you haven't seen the movie lol and plus they even mentioned he's an alien.
gaming,"What kind of orgies have you been going to 

It's not supposed to go in your eyes"
gaming,"Can you stop doing this thing where you pretend this looks any better? The original sonic design sucks balls, and it would only look worse in a live action setting."
gaming,Unfortunately Robotnik is actually pretty lanky. [Here he is before the tranformation](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/stc/images/3/3c/STC8-Kintobor.JPG/revision/latest?cb=20090505162007)
gaming,The animation in Detective Pikachu is amazing. Only way it could suck is if the writing or story is so disjointed that it's unpalatable. Here's hoping it's awesome.
gaming,He literally has like two articles of clothing. It is not hard to get right. He doesn't have white hands he wears gloves. And his belly color doesn't even match his face color. It's just weird all around.
gaming,"Okay let me help you out , Google “ games being released in 2019 “ do that and magically you’ll receive a list of games coming out this year with trailers and all 😯. You spend time on reddit but don’t have time to google games you want ? So if this list was never posted on Reddit you would just sit in your chair and never play a single game because you wouldn’t know what was being released? What you’re telling me is you waited years for this post ? Woooooww dude you’re some kind of special aren’t you ? This list is worthless sorry not sorry"
gaming,This guy has just done the equivalent of polishing a turd!
gaming,Was it one three-hour long game? We go through 'em in 45 minutes at this point (but we get to play a few times a week). Anyway I feel your pain. And your La Croix flavor.
gaming,it's a youtube channel
gaming,then you are OG
gaming,Praise be to Eggman for trying to kill that blue abomination.
gaming,This is actually good
gaming,I dont understand why you kids cry so much about this.
gaming,"This is literally TMNT all over again, does nobody else remember or see this??"
gaming,They could have easily gone the Who Framed Roger Rabbit route and used a 2D animation style with live action actors. Especially after the love that some fan made Sonic animations get. But that would take even the slightest awareness of what your fans want lol.
gaming,I could watch this!
gaming,"I think they just cgi'd the face a bit, they also removed the guns from the movie.  There was a South Park episode about it.  It was like the year 2000 or 2001

Edit- it was released on DVD 2002 with the changes, the DVD also included the original version"
gaming,Finally someone who knows what REAL grails are
gaming,"Guys, this film was targeted at children. It wasn't targeted at the full on raging 25 year olds on reddit. The music should've clued you in to the fact that this movie is supposed to be absurd. You know how I know that? IT'S ABOUT A FUCKING VIDEO GAME CHARACTER."
gaming,"I haven't even played it.

It's just a great example of how to use the ""Unpopular opinion"" tag when posting to reddit.

here's another one from r/films...

 ""Unpopular Opinion:  Pulp fiction is my favorite Tarantino movie"""
gaming,"https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/6/18253330/sonic-the-hedgehog-live-action-fan-redesign

There's been others that work better, the one op posted is just one off the latest"
gaming,"I bet you're so proud you win internet arguments. Probably makes up for your lack of confidence in the real world. How to tell an incel: acting tough online

      K e K        beeeeeeeetaaaaaaaaaaaaa"
gaming,"I could draw a stickman and paint it blue, and it would still look better than the movie's version of Sonic"
gaming,Yeah but his was most recent so he should feel the worst.
gaming,"They could have done it better if they'd taken notes from Who framed Roger Rabbit or Space Jam. Cartoony cgi avoids the problem, but realistic CGI of a cartoon character is creepy."
gaming,How could you fuck up sooo badly...
gaming,"Large connected eyes. Mouth way off centre. Weird giant white, disproportionate gloves...I love it!!"
gaming,God damn that looks so much better!
gaming,Finally a photo realistic sonic!
gaming,they are doing in this obviously bad style for a reason these producers know that it looks bad.
gaming,"I actually really got into the Nickelodeon show. I think that was an awesome art-style.

In fact, I'd argue that they really ought to be aiming for a similar vibe when it comes to Sonic. Just keep it simple, focus more on having the characters convey personality.

Really, Sonic Boom's show has excellent quality. I just don't think it's terribly compelling, and not crazy about the specific character designs."
gaming,It’s Sanic “GOTTA GO FAST!” 😁
gaming,We do four players in about 45 minutes.
gaming,Yeah idk why either the devs literally say the same thing on the community page tbat they are working on it lmao
gaming,Congratulations you are epic
gaming,"This one sells better. If it was just a Sonic game cutscene extended to 2 hours, I wouldn't go watch it.

This new abomination? I'm in!"
gaming,Dead island. Literally just 1000 side missions that are fetch quests
gaming,I genuinely believe 06 could have been great with  polishing.
gaming,The Sonic film looks like some bullshit put together by a marketing executives board.
gaming,"""It's like I'm wearing nothing at all""

""Nothing at all""

""Nothing at all"""
gaming,Unpopular opinion: I don't care that he doesn't look cartoonish
gaming,"zero advertising compared to league, you see lol ads everywhere on youtube and twitch. But yeah, lol definitely needs advertising, because their esports games with 30 minutes of build up for 2 minutes of action isn't going to attract anyone."
gaming,Because thats not cosplay
gaming,I read that as Sock the hogidontevenknow. I imagine him running to the fridge and back for a beer.
gaming,If you're in the mood just look for a minecraft server to hop in and help out with shit.
gaming,This man knows the fucking lore and i love it
gaming,thats actually how he is modeled in his 3d games.
gaming,"To be fair, it does look like it’s about to ask you “got any crack?!” while it twitches at you."
gaming,i bet they rework sonics look before the movie releases
gaming,Definitely cheaper for traditional filming than all high-quality CGI. That and they probably wanted it to be marketed less towards just kids and a fully animated Sonic movie definitely would be.
gaming,Evidently OP doesn’t have much hedgehog experience
gaming,THIS GAME WAS AWESOME!
gaming,"I just picked up the 4th edition of TI but am not sure if my friend and I will be able to find a third who wants to play it all day. I'm excited though, I haven't played that game since the first version."
gaming,"Just another quick note, the way you tried to use it also wouldn’t make sense. Using “how does this thing pale in comparison to that” would be basically saying “I think they’re pretty comparable actually, how is it that you think they’re so different?” You’re better off leaving out the “How” and just making the statement “movie sonic pales in comparison to this drawing!”"
gaming,Did some dude on twitter just do a better job than hollywood?
gaming,Nah it would. There's other redesigns that don't clash but resemble sonic properly but this ain't quite it
gaming,Maybe this is the key part we have all been missing. The plot in the movie is that Sonic  has been drugging himself everyday for years and that's why he looks like he does.
gaming,"
Why, the kind where it can go wherever I like! 

The best kind."
gaming,Better than that movie shit for certain
gaming,"TBH this is me in every board game. I'm desperately trying to figure out if I have some kind of f-ing tell, b/c literally every plan I make is smashed into pieces moments before I can put them into play."
gaming,Only CGI him when he talks or spins/runs. It would be an amazing B-movie.
gaming,Because once you have children you don’t have time for D&amp;D.
gaming,Your art was the prettiest art of all art.
gaming,How did that Togawa trap get all the way over there? Windship? Windship.
gaming,Am I the only one that does not understand the hate?
gaming,"I usually find out about games through what my buddies are talking about. I didnt wait years for this post, I simply thought it was a decent reference list. Why are you being such an asshole?"
gaming,"No one cares to write correctly? That's where you're wrong, my dude. And I phrased is as being educational in case english isn't his first language. No one was trying to be an asshole"
gaming,just get prepared to get stomped in your first 50 games or so
gaming,Hurts to look at left
gaming,That’s honestly ridiculous 😂
gaming,Buy Baldurs Gate 2 Enhanced Edition and enjoy real gaming experience
gaming,"Though if Detective Pikachu does well, I think we’ll see a continuation of movies on video games."
gaming,"This is what's so bad about the look for me. He looks too human, like a furry or a person in a sonic costume. I don't understand why they had to make him look so creepy."
gaming,The movie pains me.
gaming,"&gt; This new sonic has an estimate of 90 million.

Well we know how much expensive drugs are now..."
gaming,I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought of that scene.
gaming,Yeah the first day it would say you got gold and xp it wouldnt save now it just doesnt give anything. Havent played today though. Idk if they got an update. Other than that its a fantastic game
gaming,That's one of the few things I got a kick out of honestly.
gaming,Depends on the guy tbh much like anything else video games are just as much of a hobby as jogging working out or anything else so it's more of what the individual guy likes
gaming,"Well the older movies used puppets and that is timeless. But cgi in say the scrorpian king.. Come on people shit on it even today.

And 20 or 30 years from now people will shit on MCU."
gaming,What in the high-def Pikachu :O
gaming,"ah didn't know there was a difference, thanks!"
gaming,It's like they don't actually know what sonic looks like and they did a police profile sketch from someones description.
gaming,"Can you get that on ps4?

I know I’m limited"
gaming,"&gt;How does what they've done even pail in comparison

  


What he meant was what they've done doesn't kick the bucket in comparison. Kick the pail. Or simply pail. English is weird."
gaming,"Depends on the man and depends on the woman, me and my wife are both gamers (although recently I’ve burned myself out a bit) but we don’t get in the way of each other and the games we want to play."
gaming,"no, furries actually make their stuff look good. There's no way this wouldn't have been improved if they had actually hired furries for character design."
gaming,"you people are complete imbeciles

the point was to make sonic realistic, like how pokemon did with their new movie, but this moron just made a classic cartoon sonic. the movie's art director may be a bad designer but at least he's not an imbecile that draws mouths sideways and unified eyeballs."
gaming,"I wonder if partially the design is because they used motion capture? Like they had an actor do the part in one of those 'dot suits', so maybe they had to make him more human-proportioned.

But then, Gollum was motion captured, too, and he's not quite proportioned like Andy Serkis."
gaming,Make him not look like a furry
gaming,"I wonder if Paramount is even remotely aware of how big a colossal fuck up this is, and the film doesn't even hit theaters until November."
gaming,"Make no mistake, everything you see in the Sonic on the left was mulled over for hours, by committees of people, to maximize return for sponsors. 

The shoes alone can explain the legs (Nike want's something realistic enough around the ankle which leads to that mess of a body). and I'm sure there's tons of little heres and theres that somebody, somewhere, demanded so that their product would be properly represented, lest they pull their funds for the movie."
gaming,this man is a god
gaming,"They were different kinds of hot. I appreciate them both.

Everyone in the gang was beautiful. Freddie Prinze Jr is Freddie Prinze Jr, and Matthew Lillard was always a pretty dude imo."
gaming,i didnt notice at first all the various things wrong with their version of sonic.. mostly its the proportions. Sonic has a large head but they gave him a regular head and regular legs and regular sized hands.. he literally looks like kid dressed up in a cheap costume
gaming,"At first, I kept my eyes tightly shut, but then I dared. I dared to look.

Merciful God in heaven, grant that I am mistaken, that what I thought I saw was but the product of my shattered nerves. I would like to think it was a threatening cloud, a wisp of smoke or fog, or a vestige of darkness.

In the distance, close to a horizon which it obliterated in its entirety, a formidable mask leered. Its eyes were skimming the countryside, just as a nightmarish prowler would peer over the ridge of a wall. No, no, they must have been two aquamarine holes cut through the disappearing gloom in the east, and nothing more. What else could it have been? You know how clouds assume the most fantastic shapes... I shall always repeat that it cannot have been anything else. Indeed, I am certain a being of such magnitude would not allow itself to be glimpsed by terrestrial creature... Else it would continue to spy on us in the small hours, continue to peer at the insignificant insects we are, and its heavy tread would make the bottom of the ocean tremble."
gaming,"I was thinking more of, don’t CGI him and just have him on the screen and have the voiceover- like some terrible 90s b class movie."
gaming,"I wouldn't have minded something like that Looney Tunes movie Space Jam, but *this*-"
gaming,"Off the top of my head, Hyper Light Drifter. It's a top down action game with an entirely show don't tell story. The game has beautiful pixel art and a very atmospheric soundtrack. It's also fairly challenging. In the beginning, you can choose one of 4 paths to take. I went west and died a lot to that boss before i beat him. I had no upgrades at the time and didn't know that the western boss is the hardest of the first four. Eventually beat that boss and felt satisfied after a couple of failed attempts. I like the game a lot but I wish that the in-game map was better. It doesn't show your exact location. It instead gives you a vague idea of where you are. Made finding some of the pieces you need to progress a bit of a pain."
gaming,"even if sonic looked more like his video game counterpart, the movie would still be hot garbage. yeah, sonic lools stupid, but that's just the most obvious part. the rest of the entire trailer looked like the movie industry learned nothing from the rest of the awful video game movies out there."
gaming,"Never thought I would ever say this, but that is too much ass for me"
gaming,You'd think they'd layer everything so that you could easily swap out one element without so much work.
gaming,"I dont think you can refer to him as a security researcher anymore.

You can say that he used to be one, but in this case, he was being a criminal."
gaming,I feel like it would of worked if they just kept the proportions. Like wtf did they think.?
gaming,"i guarantee you, some big corporate asshole who never played the games saw the first version and said it didn't look realistic even though he didn't have a clue what a talking hedgehog that can run 3000mph is supposed to look like."
gaming,Just Google search the live action ninja turtles movies and look at one of their faces
gaming,15 years late. SEGA died long ago....
gaming,I can *hear* this image
gaming,At least Hop remembered the rear view mirror.  That always drives me nuts.
gaming,So the small shitty newyork corner petstore is assumed to sell 5 differnent species of baby turtle to a kid?
gaming,"What is wrong with you people? I didn't phrase anything like an asshole. I was trying to help with a way to remember the correct word to use in that sentence in case English wasn't his first language. Pail is literally defined as ""a bucket"". There is no other definition. Period."
gaming,"Because overall after everything,animation is still viewed as a kids medium. Even with the big studios,which aren’t helping matter,to perpetuate that. 

Their are still studios that make great works,but it isn’t nearly enough."
gaming,"The one on the left is a guy in a furry outfit about to start wanking off a guy in a Pikachu outfit, the one on the right is a movie adaptation of the game we know and love."
gaming,"Oh I don't know, I don't think so... On PS 4 so far Witcher 3 is my favourite but I'm biased cause I grew up with the books."
gaming,"Holy shit, they should've hired this guy. Oh well at least we get the memes now."
gaming,Had to check what you mean... what in the fuck is THAT? Why do they have to do this shit?
gaming,Who says it needs to be identical?
gaming,Only issue I see is the EA battlefront. If it was the original Battlefront 2 it would be perfect
gaming,"It's been some time since I've played minecraft, but the last time I messed with servers I remember people being kind of protective of their little build areas, has it changed much?"
gaming,Fine if Detective Pikachu is any indication.
gaming,"This but unironically. Some fellow asshole will think you're funny. My brother does this. But  ofc he's more trolly than real mean and doesn't actually care what people think.

Rule of thumb tho is that you can't force people to play games you like. Instead try picking a game where playing together is very common, like Foxhole, or board games."
gaming,"Yeah, that doesn't look that bad. Knuckles, on the other hand."
gaming,Yup half of them are so nerfed to the grounds that they are not viable
gaming,"Eehh, I think it's more in the 600-900 range."
gaming,I would agree. Things can be redesigned correctly.
gaming,I guess they're just going to phone it in.   They do have phones right?
gaming,"Honestly, I doubt it. So long as studios are willing to chase trends instead of leading the market, you'll continue to get dumpster fires like this. Spiderverse was largely only possible thanks to Lord &amp; Miller, who have been responsible for some of the best animated films in recent history - and Sony recently struck a 9-figure deal with them because they're that good at what they do. You won't be able to get the equivalent of Lord &amp; Miller on every ""major"" animated project. 

You'll see people try and copy the idea, of course, but it won't be successful. It'll be like DC/Warner trying to copy Marvel/Disney's success.

Don't get me wrong - I'd love to see movies like Spiderverse more. It's my favorite Spider-Man film, even over the Sam Raimi SM2. But big budget films have a tendency to follow the ""latest craze"" instead of taking their own risks. For every MCU, there's a DCEU or Universal's attempt at a cinematic universe."
gaming,"Infinitely better than the original. It's fucking Sonic lol, why did they have to give him human proportions?"
gaming,A screenshot or link to this has been posted multiple times a day in this sub since this happened
gaming,"I know it’s unrelated and a niche comment but in r/2007scape, the community proves this. The game developers aren’t always gold and get ridiculed for the design work, the community corrects the ugly design every so often. However, this movie is in the end stage and is most likely finished. I don’t know how no one has commented on the design of this *cat*."
gaming,I like this better than the version people keep making that's just a model from a Sonic game. I'd rather see something original for the movie than just the same model in the games.
gaming,"For not much more you could buy a Raspberry Pi, load RetroPi on it and have access to all of those games and more..."
gaming,Crickey....isn't she a bute.....
gaming,It’s made by fans that sega hired on. The same people who made the mobile ports for Sonic 1 and 2. Christian Whitehead I believe. It’s really a love letter to any fan of the Genesis games. Lots of overwhelmingly positive reviews.
gaming,I loved Z Nation.
gaming,What's the average play time for this game? I might buy it and play it with friends and classmates in between my brakes in class.
gaming,"it already looks a 1000 times better, they're ruining sonic"
gaming,"Wow, ya, left guy looks like a kid in a fursuit, right looks like, well, sonic."
gaming,Trash talking can be fun without being insulting
gaming,"These are two different types of strokes my friend, lol. My gf is a huge fan of KH, but this one didn't capture her attention. I, on the other hand, absolutely loved RE2. Its thoughtfully redesigned, and I felt a horrific tenseness the whole way through. Like a ""waiting for the other boot to drop"" constant tension. It was well done."
gaming,"Arguably, you can't just throw a giant blue superpowered hedgehog in a world without explaining it so whatever explanation covers that could surely extend to him being a cartoon."
gaming,"I feel like we could do with a return to that style, at least in the indie space. For one thing, it'd be a lot less expensive than relying on super-expensive CGI gubbins. And it'd probably be better than what Disney's been trying to pull off with their ""live action CGI"" remakes of classic Disney movies.

Though with that said, I feel like the ""live action CGI"" style MIGHT work well for the upcoming Mulan remake. Honestly, while I couldn't give a toss about most Disney films nowadays, Mulan has my special attention since the original was my favourite Disney film, with my all-time favourite Disney princess. And while I haven't gone to the movies in nearly a decade, I'll at least get the DVD when it drops."
gaming,It has begun. Run.
gaming,Already played it I loved it too but I’m stuck between the two options I stated cos I love both the previous ones to them.
gaming,I'm read this and didn't know there was a new digimon game coming out. I got to get it now!
gaming,This looks tons better and not at all horrifying. Who's idea was it to make a live action *Sonic* movie anyway?
gaming,Please do this for the entire film so it can actually be watchable.
gaming,"No when using a comparison the correct word is pale. 


pale
/pāl/
adjective

feeble and unimpressive.

""unconvincing rock that came across as a pale imitation of Bruce Springsteen""

pail
/pāl/
noun

noun: pail; plural noun: pails

a bucket."
gaming,I see what you mean.
gaming,They used Sonic to sell Soap shoes with Sonic Adventure
gaming,Seeing how much better this is makes me even more angry at the abomination we've been given.
gaming,Anything is better than soinc becomming a furry.
gaming,"We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.

Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can."
gaming,My soul is sad 😢
gaming,The left...reminds me of the Cat in the hat movie...
gaming,"Cry harder. 

I can see your twisted panties from here"
gaming,"Detective Pikachu uses this same style, but is done 1000% better."
gaming,I’ve been referring to god of war as gow without realizing it could also be gears of war wow
gaming,"You can't change the model without modifying the animation keyframes, it would be a nightmare to change it at this point."
gaming,That’s why I am so troubled I love both resident evil and kingdom hearts haha.
gaming,"I'm only posting commando quotes.

""Keep 'em comin'!"""
gaming,Right? /u/Superfluous_Thom is getting buried but that movie does NOT hold up. I wonder if any of those downvoters actually watched the movie in the past 20 years.
gaming,"What’s this? People who love and are passionate about the blue hedgehog were able to make a design better than a company’s higher-ups who have little to no experience of what makes sonic iconic and adored by many? 
#SHOCKING"
gaming,So that cosplay doesn't look weird and it's easy to make a costume.
gaming,Where the gloves tbh.
gaming,"But they didn't even succeed at making him look like a hedgehog, which would have at least been interesting. He just looks like a human boy in Sonic pajamas and a Disney park helmet."
gaming,"Of course. It’s not universal, not every guy will be attracted to a girl just because she plays games, but it’d work the same way everything else does when it comes to attraction."
gaming,"eh I think Pokemon is the one exception to the rule, or at least its possibly the schematic for how to do it right"
gaming,2011 was the best year of lol
gaming,"It's one of those games that looks and sounds super complicated, but then you play two or so turns and it clicks."
gaming,Probably a lot of merch already made with that creepy face on too.
gaming," No, but they should. Lol"
gaming,Dude finding Nemo was 16 years ago. Computers have gotten more than a little bit faster and it doesn’t take nearly as long to render any more.
gaming,I've played neither so can't help you there...  I can tell you that horizon zero dawn though amazing bored me
gaming,And a Gameboy on the desk as well!
gaming,"The eyes, for me, are the sticking point. They simply don't fit, and should not be."
gaming,Its a trap...stranger danger zone!
gaming,"nah, just [taffy puller](https://youtu.be/MmgBNABx2Go)"
gaming,What does on there? They are holding competitions I am assuming but on what scale? Never seen this before
gaming,"""gamers"" ≠ near topless women showing off their tatas for views."
gaming,"I would recommend getting a 2DS or a New 2DS XL. There are plenty of games to play, cheaply priced.
Definitely get him Smash 3DS, Zelda Ocarina of Time, any Pokémon game, Mario Kart 7 (if not bundled), Super Mario 3D Land, Yo-Kai Watch 2, Fire Emblem Awakening, Sonic Lost World, Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed, LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins, Hyrule Warriors, Luigi's Mansion, Minecraft and Xenoblade Chronicles 3D (the last 2 only work on the New 2DS).
There are also way more, I'd suggest taking a look at the Nintendo Selects and check . Anyways, have fun!
PS: The 2DS can also play original DS games."
gaming,This is a repost. I drew this a few weeks back but figured some of you who haven't seen it and with that trailer being dropped.. I thought some of you  might get a chuckle out of it.
gaming,I am personally offended that you just called Homeward Bound a terrible b movie
gaming,The future is now old man
gaming,I played that too I never did finish it something else got my attention at the time.
gaming,"RL trumps online always, all the time, every time."
gaming,Im not that far yet.  Im excited to see the ending though.but Between work and having a girlfriend i havent been able to finish....  Ahh sigh
gaming,That looks like an explanation of the fur and not overall character design
gaming,"What I don't understand is, they designed a CG blue hedgehog, It's already outrageous. Why not just go all the way and keep the proportions cartoony as hell? I don't get it."
gaming,"&gt;since it's just waiting for some computers to spit out what all the work has gone into making

Which delays the release of the movie &amp; costs thousands of dollars each hour in computing resources."
gaming,"Oh fuck yeah, one of the best films I've seen stoned ever. Love fear and loathing in Las Vegas dude"
gaming,"To be fair, a lot of Walmarts in the Mid West are the shopping malls of the 80-90s yesteryears. A place to hang out because it's really the only thing to do in your town."
gaming,this comment gave me goosebumps
gaming,Captain Cevapici was always better than Iron Gop and you can fight me on that.
gaming,Both those guys have the exact expression
gaming,That shoe theory is bad
gaming,"I wished it had a bigger multiplayer community. I always wanted some kind of big team battles and what not. I'm kinda tired of battle royale games, but a battle royale mode would be perfect for that game."
gaming,I love my PS Vita but it’s very niche.
gaming,"“It shows that by only focusing on one objective, one may end up neglecting, or resorting to sacrificing, other important elements. Similarly, [in the real world] if we make maximizing profits as the absolute objective, we fail to take into consideration the social and environmental consequences.”

Interesting read."
gaming,Call of Duty series
gaming,Kindergarten Art Homework by Hippo Kids Games good for your kids
gaming,Much better. But it's not like the company is going to go back and re do Sonic at this point.
gaming,Have you given D&amp;D or any Tabletop RPG on Roll20 a try?
gaming,Sponsors get in the way of a lot of things.
gaming,"I can understand why they went with the smaller eyes, because if you actually have to build it in 3D at that size the eyes would overlap if they are presumed spherical. But, at least make a white fur raccoon-style mask around the eyes to make it stylistically similar. They just got rid of the white on his face completely and made it look creepy."
gaming,Dude we have way better taste than that.
gaming,"My son is a huge sonic fan at 6, he is not that happy about what they made him look like"
gaming,"Yeah, the legs definitely are the main difference."
gaming,I haven’t had my coffee yet ?
gaming,fixed contraction mistake in my previous comment. I got bored with horizon and started Witcher 3 on game + instead. Spder-man was entertaining too
gaming,"They probably could. It would result in other glitches which will need to be taken care of. It is possible but it will take time, hence more cost. Probably not worth it."
gaming,"Fair enough, but regardless of what they're wearing, people do still watch female game streamers. Obviously the scantily-clad ones will get more attention from the horn dogs."
gaming,This is the Turtles all over again. TF were they thinking?
gaming,"Well yea because it's still the pokemon world,  sonic is basically an alien in this movie lol"
gaming,"Honest, who cares? It looks fine for the direction they went. It's not supposed to be a cartoon."
gaming,"Idk man its been years for me but I remember lots of great servers and lots of crappy ones, just gotta find a fun one for you. 

I would usually look for a server on forums/reddit to get a good idea of what it was like."
gaming,See you boys in the circle jerk later
gaming,So much less terrifying
gaming,"I don't have much time to play anymore, but if we both have a game, we could probably play something for an hour or two sometime. I used to be fairly big into GW2, but haven't touched the game in years. I do have Overwatch, though I don't play it. When I'm online, I mostly play strategy type games (Civilization and Armello mostly).

Throw a PM at me with your Steam name and I'll toss a friend at you."
gaming,"Just think, some people who worked on this actually thought it looked good enough to put out into the world."
gaming,Look how they resurrected my boy.
gaming,I played spider man I enjoyed it too.
gaming,I highly doubt anyone crying over SONIC is a kid anymore lmao.
gaming,"Computers have gotten faster but scenes have also gotten more complex.

For Frozen:

“We had at least 50 effects artists and lighting artists working together to create that long shot,” says Lee. “It took about 30 hours to render just one frame; that’s 4,000 computers rendering one frame at a time. That’s why that scene is one of my favorites. It really represents the journey all of us took on that movie.”

gaming,"If my local gamestop ends up having a copy, can I still hit you up? I've played the other fallout games."
gaming,more tech = more nerds = more indie gamers basically
gaming,Whats so wrong about that? I think jim carrey is the only redeeming thing about this movie.
gaming,The shoes and human proportions make him MORE naked.
gaming,"Thanks, I guess I just tried too hard to make it sound like how I felt. (I don't know how to express that really, I'm terrible with writing but the art didn't just deserve a generic comment - I think I just fell over a couple hurdles.)"
gaming,"Yeah in theory it seems simple... just update the model in each project file and re-render right?  but that will inevitably break things and not look correct and so animators, modelers, riggers, and nearly everyone in the 3d pipeline is at least going to have to touch each of these frames and say ""yup... not broken anymore"" until they even CAN render them.  Rendering is time consuming... but there's a gigantic question mark around just how much will go wrong if they try to adjust the character design and redo everything."
gaming,"i've played it. It's marginally better, but the game has the depth of a puddle on asphalt. Got bored quickly"
gaming,"*Hot take* if the movie did style him like that, ya'll would just find something else to complain about."
gaming,Definitely wayyy better. Left one looks like a horrible looking mascot costume.
gaming,Anti-zombie units are standing by...
gaming,"It's one character.  Presumably way less rendering time than a full animated scene like finding nemo.  Also, I'm going to take a guess that skilled labor hours are much more expensive than passive computing hours."
gaming,Something definitely stood when I saw this pic
gaming,Still can’t believe the one on the right is not the one that’s gonna be used in the movie
gaming,"I would never say anything so absurd or offensive!

I was talking about silly kid related stuff that would just show a still of something, voiceover, and then back to movie."
gaming,"I was just thinking about this, just from a dimensions standpoint with the shorter legs and all."
gaming,"Eat ass smoke grass, I just got paid 8500 bucks for 3 days of work loser 

don't @ me you neet get a job"
gaming,"Dodges rocket, csnnot dodge tranq gun."
gaming,"No idea why, but this had me rolling. Thanks for the laugh pal, have an upvote."
gaming,Wow...that simple change actually makes ALLL of the difference. I have no idea how the sonic shown on the left was actually put into production....
gaming,"&gt; love sonic and always wanted to see him on the big screen.

That mentality is why this abortion is happening."
gaming,[Or all those weird pictures of me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBNNTnDhzeY)
gaming,I'd think it's technically a board game movie... At least Jumanji is... I haven't seen the second but I feel like I remember a arcade version or something from previews so maybe?
gaming,"God the thing on the left doesn't even fucking look like Sonic, it just looks like some asshole in gay blue leggings and Nike's"
gaming,Ive been having fun with it. Its nothing ground breaking but its fun and pretty well made
gaming,What is going on with all these sonic pics are they making a movie?
gaming,"There are so many things wrong with OG on the left but I still don't understand why they gave him white furry hands. 

It's so clear that Sonic has ALWAYS worn white gloves. It's the pretty consistent with all the Sonic world characters, 90% OF THEM WEAR GLOVES."
gaming,I heard that have a lot of collision bugs
gaming,"He IS Jesus, doing a lot of sawing and all"
gaming,[My inner Al Pacino is comin out for this pic](https://youtu.be/P4VySkRVYhI)
gaming,"WHEN WILL YOU LEARN, THAT YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!"
gaming,"It's unbelievable how they can get it so wrong, the edited picture is so much better, the first one looks like a dude in a Sonic costume, the edited looks like Sonic."
gaming,It's not like you can just swap the models out and re-render like that is all that's necessary. Every interaction he has in the movie will have to be redone. by hand.
gaming,The pic on the left reminds me of the cat in the hat.
gaming,"If it's spoiler-reliant, sure. FTL is not that hard if you're used to classic roguelikes. Some of those games take decades to win.

The game is pretty RNG-dependent. Despite that ppl have 95% winrate on hard IIRC. Not with the weaker ships though. There's also a spectrum of letting people pick the same thing every time vs sometimes randomly drawing unwinnable builds. TGGW is a good example of the second, completely unfair but it's different every time so that's a plus."
gaming,"Yeah, you'd also think they would make sonic look like fucking sonic ! It's not like they had a shortage of footage, games, cartoons, .... but here we are."
gaming,"There's a walmart near me with one like that, and yes, we do Smash Ult tourneys every Thursday :&gt; 

Gets around 40-50 entrants too."
gaming,Wait the one on the left is the real fucking thing? Kill it with fire omg what the actual hell is that
gaming,Can you drive other vehicles? Like the cars laying around.
gaming,Whoever worked on this movie.. shame on yourself. Sonic can’t catch a break when it comes to most games let alone this movie. Shame
gaming,"They should have thrown out a teaser image, a poster, or a teaser trailer about 6 months ago. The reaction would have been the same, and they would have had time to re-evaluate their character design going forward. But assuming they don't push the release, I can't see how they could change much given their time frame.

I am not a huge fan of the design, but it's not quite the Goombas from the Super Mario movie."
gaming,I see now. This whole film is just a platform to sell hairy Sonic onesies.
gaming,"Right, I agree.  My point is that rendering time is the least of the challenges."
gaming,I'm confused.  The whole point of your post was to show how horrible movie Sonic is and how much better he can look.  There's been countless fan redesigns and they all look miles better.  We don't really need to hypothesise here.
gaming,You have a 2080ti and didn’t notice it has HDMI ports?
gaming,Sweet Jesus fegalvao is thick!
gaming,Cant wait to see what this game can offer on PS5!
gaming,"Perhaps, but his looks are not the worst thing in that trailer... everything else about that two and a half minute disaster screams 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and maybe a -5 on Metacritic."
gaming,Please point to where Epic encourages children to take their parent's credit card without permission.
gaming,"The Nike explanation for the body type is being taken as truth when it doesn't make any sense. In the image above the shoes are literally unchanged between the left and right versions of the character besides being slightly bigger (which would benefit Nike as their product is now more prominent).

IMO the easiest and most likely explanation is that the producers wanted something like Rocket Raccoon - a character that looks mostly like an animal but is anthropomorphized vs sticking a cartoon in their movie Roger Rabbit style. 

Of course if they'd bothered to actually craft a world where the right most character could feasibly live (like how the Pokemon movie has done it) then this isn't really an issue."
gaming,Huh. Looks 1000x better.
gaming,"Enter the Gungeon has a nice nod to this, and then the other meme ""all I know is that I have to kill"" plays greatly along afterwards."
gaming,"Oh I know, I own it on Steam but never installed it."
gaming,"&gt;I don’t understand how they got him so wrong.

The right picture comes from someone who cares.

The left picture comes from someone who doesn't."
gaming,"Someone give him a job at Sony Animation, my dude deserves a massive payraise"
gaming,I haven't gotten an email and i got the plat a while ago.
gaming,This is the best meme i’v seen in years!
gaming,"Yeah, I agree, I was just making a joke lol"
gaming,Kinda looks like a kid wearing a sonic snuggie.
gaming,People can’t watch more than 1 movie a month? Lmao
gaming,As a movie geared towards children and parents who played these games as kids...I apologize on the creators behalf for you and your son.
gaming,"What's sad is looking at the edited one, I might actually have enjoyed this movie..."
gaming,"It's incredible how one person corrected everything that was wrong with that design.
They could have had their fur and more realistic design while maintaining the resemblance and familiarity."
gaming,"It's those eyes. I can live with the rest, but the eyes..."
gaming,"Yeah, why didn’t they follow TMNT 2007 instead?"
gaming,I didn't even know there was a Muppets 2 (other than the Caper) until last week. Marketing seems like it was a big reason...
gaming,How have they not seen the absolute outcry about how he looks and spent the money reanimating him so the movie doesn't flop?
gaming,Is this that Ray traced Minecraft I've been seeing lately... Because I honestly can't tell.
gaming,The new Pokémon movie actually looks like it came out the anime/games into the real world ya dumbass sonic looks like he did meth for 5 years straight.
gaming,"Never actually used the place but from the signs outside and the people playing you can get an idea. Pretty sick looking set up they have. About 20 high end PCs running in a dark room with accent lighting around each station.

Every day has a theme. Like fortnite Friday, smash bros Wednesday, rocket league Tuesday. Seems like they only have the game for the theme running on that given day. Never seen anyone playing something that differed from the theme though.

I'm sure they do have tournaments, but unsure if there are any actual prizes.

I can try to get a good picture of it open next time I am at the Walmart"
gaming,Probably because you havent had enough carbs today for proper mood regulation/brain function.
gaming,There are more pictures. They're all....unsettling.
gaming,"Or perhaps he said ""there are 100x as many people who have not played Sonic as there are who have played Sonic. The people who played Sonic will come see the movie anyway, but the weird shape might turn off those who hadn't."""
gaming,"Not even comparable. The original is terrible, the reworked version is perfect."
gaming,Yeah I hope it’s great. The detective Pikachu game is one of my favorites so I’m  exited
gaming,Sonic actually already had [a shoe sponsor in Sonic Adventure 2](https://i.imgur.com/pnMhEZV.jpg) and they didn't have to change the rest of the character model.
gaming,Why do you care about our opinions?
gaming,That's not true at all. It's been stupid simple to transpose mocap data to non-human proportional rigs for over a decade.
gaming,Nope just the bike.
gaming,"Well, there's a thought that makes me feel old."
gaming,The original just looks like someone dressed up as sonic or something.  Right is a lot better
gaming,Yeah cause there hasn't been any improvement in computer generated graphics and such in the over 25 years years in between these movies...
gaming,Who the fuck is that thing on the left of sonic?
gaming,"Doom was a fine action movie, except it wasn't about Doom."
gaming,"Yep, Colombian born with Lebanese roots. Fairly pale skin, but usually has a bit of a tan at the minimum, and a nice one more often than not."
gaming,Watch out! You're gonna crash! *WHOAAA*
gaming,I'm pretty sure a furry fan made the design on the left
gaming,"Considering the amount of negative publicity, I don't know if there is such a thing as too much. Movie studios are known to do massive changes to save failing movies. They have a choice of either gambling their current investment and hoping to at least get it back (unlikely) or investing even more to make it actually profitable."
gaming,It's not on Steam anymore but you can get key on instant gaming.
gaming,"The kids who know who he is will go see it anyway, even if he was purple. The people who haven't played Sonic would probably prefer an alien that's a little more believable."
gaming,"Who looked at this and went ""Yes, that wont give children nightmares"""
gaming,Just wait until the games come out with this design.
gaming,Left is just a guy in a fur suit.
gaming,Yeah probably not gonna see that movie either. This shit gives me the creeps
gaming,"The Oracle, Reading. UK."
gaming,"The fucking eyes on the original really suck.  Just changing the eyes makes it so much more ""Sonic"".  Proportions i can deal with, JUST FIX THE FUCKING EYES!"
gaming,"If you have a PS4, Grow Up and Grow Home are great relaxing games. Gauntlet: Slayer Edition is also good for mindless dungeon crawling/gold collecting. 

I always like wreaking some havoc in GTA and just getting into car chases with the cops or going on random murder sprees. 

I play a lot of an old ps3 version of Bomberman a lot too, really great to zone out to. 

Almost any twin-stick shooter is good too, usually they have good visuals and don't really rely on sound too much. 

I like to listen to music/podcasts while I play games when I'm trying to relax - this is my wheelhouse."
gaming,If Sega wanted more power and control over what Paramount does with their IP they should have included it in the contract. It's Sega's fault too.
gaming,I think they did it on purpose to generate more buzz. Some director knew their base would meme the fuck out of this monstrosity and now look where we are? The Internet can’t shut up about it.
gaming,Seriously! Why didn’t they just make him look like this??
gaming,Have the creators explained themselves on how dumb he looks? How did they think this looked good?
gaming,So much better. The original reminds me of that dehydrated fox meme
gaming,Looks so much better. Paramount should hire you!
gaming,Depends what time the store closes where you live.
gaming,"Well this sort of interaction isn't possible unless you have a complex ""fall when shot"" mechanic. It's not just a ragdoll afaik."
gaming,That's what I thought. Gameboy speaker boobs upgrade
gaming,"Much better. I would've liked a correct arm color, but I can't complain that much considering what we have now."
gaming,"They didn't assume nobody would give a shit. They assumed anyone who would give a shit is invested enough to go see the movie anyway.

It's money, remember? This one isn't art."
gaming,You're one of those accounts...
gaming,When will you people learn!
gaming,There seems to be deep sonic lore that I have never known and now need...
gaming,I appreciate the inclusion of Skullomania.
gaming,"It kind of reminded me of Far Cry (which for me is good because I like Far Cry). But if you thought that Far Cry 5 was too generic or too unoriginal, you'll probably feel the same about Days Gone, unless you're super into zombies"
gaming,Seriously wtaf is the left one?? 😂 Nice job on the right one tho
gaming,All my years of playing Pokémon taught me this too.
gaming,"The preview looked terrible. The character looked terrible. 

Seeing this makes the character in the trailer look 1000% worse."
gaming,Lmao this movie is getting destroyed
gaming,"Sweet.  I'm playing ""stereotypical people's opinions of the new Sonic movie"".  Strong black female gets me one away."
gaming,Dude frozen is 6 years old. The processors back then were still 22nm. They’re down to 14nm and even 7nm in some cases and the core count is insane now. It takes a hell of a lot less time to render now than it did even as recently as 2013.
gaming,"It says to claim the skin on the account you want it on, in my experience Epic hasn’t been to helpful to their players, other people might have different experiences but I lost 4 skins for no reason and epic basically told me to suck it up. (No longer have the emails or would show you)"
gaming,You'd just have six stamps then.
gaming,"Well, not many are going to give enough of a shit to see this movie."
gaming,Free Free Free Free FREE! Free Free Free Free? FREE!!!
gaming,Will it ever end!?!?
gaming,You're not a wizard Harry.
gaming,Oh noooooooooo people are going to leave their homes and meet up with other people for a fun social activity!
gaming,"Are you going to see it anyway, in spite of Sonic looking more human?"
gaming,What do you think now
gaming,"...yeah, but why wasn’t I invited to the riot?"
gaming,Let's just start a kickstarter for a Sonic fan film true to the source
gaming,"Wait, why does it even look like that originally. Looks nothing like Sonic. They clearly should've hired OP"
gaming,"Conan Exiles, Dreams, World War Z, Zombie Army Trilogy, MK11"
gaming,the new sonic is cheap
gaming,This just looks out of place. The rendition in the trailer is now what I think of when I hear Sonic.
gaming,Because these guys don't know the product they are selling
gaming,"Depends on how far into production they are

They could easily make a scene in the movie that fixes his appearance"
gaming,Just cover the nose bridge with white fur.
gaming,That’s great you can redo a screen shot. But can you do a video of a little redone sonic?
gaming,"And the guy who ""worked"" on it created the biggest insult to Sonic designs."
gaming,I can attribute my mood swings to a lack of caffeine. What caused your lack of conflict resolution and your inability to think efficiently and logically ?
gaming,Ahh. It's been a while since I played so I dont remember the gym names.
gaming,"I don't normally say things like this, but Sonic really needs a thigh gap. Actually seeing one makes the Sonic on the left look even *more* like a dude in pajamas."
gaming,I find I gotta turn mine off and on a couple times every now and then for it to actually pair
gaming,"Honestly, looks actually waaaaaaaay better than the original"
gaming,"Comment checking things and saying ""I'll see you on the front page"" check...

&amp;#x200B;

There's ins't even a front page anymore..."
gaming,"Sorry about that, essentially they gave them lips and human teeth."
gaming,"""Ok, so you were all chosen because we wanna hit as many different demographics as possible, as well as the groups that have no idea who this is. So what are we thinking here ... ?""

""Well I don't like his eyes, they look big and mean""

""Yeah, also his legs are too skinny, how does he even stand up ? Plus it doesn't help promote his Nike shoes.""

""While we're at it, his stomach is too short and fat, wouldn't he be taller and fitter from all that running ?""

""I don't get it, why doesn't he have teeth ? Let's add that""

""Wow, all good ideas people. We can certainly change all that, we have the technology."""
gaming,Honestly I like new sonic. He looks more like a hedgehog and less like a legless cotton ball
gaming,"Yeah but nowhere in any game did he have electrical powers standard. He got them from pickups, but never standard. They ripped sound effects straight from the original games, so what the hell."
gaming,"&gt; a character that looks mostly like an animal but is anthropomorphized

Well, the problem there is that this Sonic is still more anthropomorphized than Rocket Raccoon. Rocket has a raccoon head with raccoon eyes and raccoon teeth.

Movie sonic has Sonic's head but with a mostly human face.

&gt; Of course if they'd bothered to actually craft a world where the right most character could feasibly live (like how the Pokemon movie has done it) then this isn't really an issue.

I mean yeah that's the real issue.

There's no gumption behind the movie. They took the laziest approach possible and went with ""He's an alien! The military is after him!"" which is just the tiredest plot motivation in movies."
gaming,This man plays siege
gaming,Those are two very different games. Just flip a coin or something.
gaming,"They are becoming a thing.

It's a way for them to market their new in-house PC's."
gaming,In what way have you determined this?
gaming,I can smell the Dew and sweat already!
gaming,"You've got a GB? Shit, beats the hell out of my Game and Watch"
gaming,"They would have to: 

1. **Remodel / Texture  the character**
2. **Reanimate every single scene**  
I remember hearing a while ago that every 1 second of a Disney movie was about 40 hours of animation work
3. **Rerender ever scene he's in**  
Monsters University took about 29 hours to render a single frame.  CGI movies run at 30 Frames per second which comes out to 870 hours of rendering per 1 second of video.  One thing to note is that these big budget movies use computer farms where they have 1000's of computers rendering simultaneously.

 TLDR;  No way in hell they're going to make any changes to the movie."
gaming,It’s a camel. Horse designed by a committee.
gaming,"Man, the left looks like a toddler in crappy pants onezee."
gaming,"And, be honest, anyone invested enough in Sonic to complain about the body shape is going to go see the movie anyway."
gaming,Or more like a depressed Sonic who's become an alcoholic.
gaming,Why would Sonic appeal to kids these days? Do they even still make Sonic games? The adults are the ones who identify with these characters
gaming,Very cool. As a gamer I would love to see this near me
gaming,"Executives: We can't have him look like a cartoon!

Detective Pikachu: Hold my beer"
gaming,Or how about “I feel asleep”?
gaming,Also just because you add lol at the end dosnt mean your comment isn’t stupid lol
gaming,Someone give this man a job
gaming,"That's not how modeling works. If it were a small change, then sure. But changing his entire model like this would then also require making a new rig from scratch. New rig, means animations have to be redone too. They can keep everything else in the scene just fine, but they'd have to redo Sonic in every single scene he was in."
gaming,"Yikes, that's rough. I'm blown away they didn't seem to test screen any of this at all! He looks so awful."
gaming,"I dont think anyone has ever said ""what i find appealing about sonic the hedgehog is that his eyes join together"" so i wouldnt say that's any part of his appeal at all. It does look better than this own brand looking mother  fucker on the left of course"
gaming,I seriously do not doubt that the executives making the Sonic movie had no clue what sonic looked like and consulted no one because they are too worried about questioning whoever was hired to make that CGI crap.
gaming,"They deserve to be insulted. This is a first year, juvenile CG student effort, and even that's being generous. I was a CG/VFX artist and later technical artist for over a decade at four very big studios, and I would have been ashamed to bring something like the Sonic on the left to a prelim design meeting. I'd be less embarrassed to bring nothing and say I forgot to do my job. The fact that this made to it production is absolutely laughable. Sega must be livid."
gaming,"That was one of my first thoughts. Sonic's design has very human proportions, which made me think it was mo-cap. A mo-cap character isnt proportioned exactly like the actor, but has to have at least a similar body structure. 

Who knows though. Either way it looks like crap."
gaming,Quick show this to a kid that doesnt know sonic and ask which is better.
gaming,"&gt;It's valid until proven otherwise? 

Nope. It's a *claim* until validated or rejected. It can also be invalidated later on. But there needs to be some form of verification or evidence presented first.

&gt;What exactly different/wrong with him claiming he has the record if there's no verification that anyone else has beaten it?

Those are separate issues. He can claim whatever he wants."
gaming,This is a repost. I drew this a few weeks back but figured some of you who haven't seen it and with that trailer being dropped.. I thought some of you  might get a chuckle out of it.
gaming,Shit be like that Ronsldo statue
gaming,"Of course however this has been a thing rockstar have done for a while now, all the way back to to GTA4 I think"
gaming,"Fucking, after playing so many RPGs as a kid NOX was a breath of fresh air.... it was so fucking satisfying to be like ""that guy has cool armour and weapons and when you kill them.. they drop all of them! none of this.. random loot shite.

also young me thought hecubah was hot as F"
gaming,"I'm going to be honest when I say that I think Dark Below should be E tier, and D2 should be in D with Destiny. Destiny 2, while it had a little less, was way more structured in terms of narrative than Dark Below."
gaming,Eeek! And that's with Pixar's budget and hardware! It's mad how much goes into it.
gaming,No worries! After today you’ll be able to express this sentiment even better for the next time some video game movie abomination comes out haha
gaming,!Remind Me 1 month
gaming,"I don't recommend gaming laptops, I regret buying mine although it has provided me years of great use. Cannot justify the price for performance. However, i still find them *incredibly* cool and keep a not-too-distant gaze on them.

Two of the best light/slim class gaming laptops are the MSI GS75 and the Asus ROG Zephyrus S. Both have a wide number of configurations, running variants with more mid range hardware averaging out at around $2000 CAD, all the way up to high performance variants with hardware pushing budgets to $4000 CAD.

Lots of options with just two well-regarded models."
gaming,"Can't sleep, merch will eat me!"
gaming,"I go both ways, I have a great pc and I also use my PS4 a lot. I hook them both up to my 55"" tv, so I don't think the TV angle makes a difference to me. I think it boils down to what kind of game I'm playing.  Some shooters I *have* to play on pc (CSGO), but mostly I prefer playing them on console. 

Some games are cheaper/run better on pc, so it's nice to have a high-quality copy I can still play with my controller (Tomb Raider is a good example, the base PS4 runs it well but my PC makes it look insane).  

I use DS4Windows, so using the controller on pc is not an issue and I don't have to be near my pc to play it through my tv, it's nice. My PS4 is also loud af, so using my pc is nice because it's quiet and has better internet browsing/youtube/netflix, so on..."

gaming,But for real that guy is amazingly entertaining
gaming,Original looks like cat in the hat
gaming,"I imagine both mouths connect to a single esophagus, like a mouth-nose."
gaming,Most major game journalist are garbage anyways.
gaming,But in the eeeeend it doesn't even matter
gaming,"The difficulty comes from the games mechanics. An easy mode would just lose the point of the game. 

Sekiro for example, requires timing. Learning timing and studying moves and studying how to counter them. If you make the game easier that’s gone. 

Look at Souls games. When players level up and go back to low level mobs, it becomes a generic hack and slash. 

The challenge and overcoming impossible odds is the game. That’s how it’s supposed to be played. If it wasn’t, FROM would include an easy mode."
gaming,"Judging by how many very talented teams miss the mark over the years it must be very difficult. District 9 was a great case of someone who fundamentally understood CGI on a smaller budget. I totally understand your point about a drawing vs motion, and I know it's not that easy. It's just crazy how he looks to me, it's deeply unsettling. Like, primal centre of the brain unsettling!"
gaming,"I mean why couldn't they just do a straight across rendition? It's not like they can't do it, the Wreck it Ralph animation would have worked perfectly in real life."
gaming,Is this a real person or a photoshop job?
gaming,And that’s a good main to have I guess
gaming,Why does Sonic look like not Sonic?
gaming,"Need to note that some units seem to function slightly different in openra, artillery being a prime example."
gaming,"This is exactly why they aren't going.  The cringe memes gamers make and constantly repeat like parrots.  

Before Blizzcon, Blizz said there would be no Diablo 4 announcement.  They show up, don't mention Diablo 4.. and gamers have an epic meltdown. So why would they let the same thing happen?"
gaming,SANEC THE PORCUPINE - GOTTA DO SPEED
gaming,"Rainbow 6 Siege is a unique take on it, it's a pretty fun game but the learning curve is a bit tough. I'd check that out and Astroneer is a great open world adventure game, similar to no mans sky, both of which are indie games."
gaming,Most likely reposting and just used the same link.
gaming,"Yeah it can affect a lot. There may be as character final/tech anim dept dealing with his fur too, they'd be brought back on in this situation as well and start over. 

Really their biggest mistake was taking such a highly stylized character and going for realism. Had it been fixed in the early design phase they could have saved so much money. But the longer you wait, the longer these early decisions snowball into something that's not even worth fixing anymore."
gaming,"That is my argument. When I was a kid I loved the hell out of them. As I got older and went back to check it out, it was a quick realization that my childhood games were actually hot garbage. Haha"
gaming,Yeah it usually is GG then something toxic typed after it or something like GG your succ

gaming,"I'm a dad now so I can make this joke: It's mo-crap. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so sorry."
gaming,"And either way, anyone who cares enough to complain about his shape cares enough to pay to see the movie anyway."
gaming,NO DONT ASK ITS A TRAP
gaming,I have been in this place before.
gaming,"The makers of this movie really sat there and was like.
Editor: should we give him his gloves
Director: Nah just make his hands white"
gaming,"Here's a pretty in-depth review for those who are interested..   
[https://ideas.walmart.ca/days-gone-review/](https://ideas.walmart.ca/days-gone-review/)"
gaming,"To be fair, from head-on, and zoomed-in it doesnt look bad, really. It's just... every single other angle does."
gaming,"...you misused ""virtue signal""."
gaming,And you think that isn't part of the point? Star Wars made way more money on marketing the toys than they ever did on the movies.
gaming,"You're talking in terms of processing similar tasks with increased resources. I'm telling you that as technology progresses, more complex tasks are also being used, which doesn't actually decrease your render times.

It's the same reason why my computer in 2006 played games at 1080P Ultra 60 FPS, but my new computer plays new titles at ... 1080P Ultra 60 FPS even with increased processing power. I don't see any performance increase because my tasks are more complex. If I went back to the 2006 games I could super sample 4K at 144+, but I can't do that on new titles."
gaming,"Ocarina of Time

/s"
gaming,"I was a 20 year old snarky videostore clerk at the time.  There wasn't much rioting over it, but we sure as hell bitched an awful lot about it at the time."
gaming,"Not with a GTX950m. It's a bit more of a budget video card for laptops. It's a fine card, but definitely not the kind of thing with the horsepower to run the most modern games on ultra."
gaming,Why should sonic get in a car? He is there faster then you 🤷🏻‍♂️
gaming,HIS ARMS ARE BLIE?!?!?
gaming,Thank you for destroying my eyesight and everything beautiful in this forsaken universe. 10 out of 10 would stab my eyes out and nuke them again.
gaming,"Pit Fighter, SNES is the first that comes to mind. Bad sound, graphics, controls... everything... on a console that had games like Street Fighter II, it was just a new level of letdown."
gaming,"I mean, that goes without saying. The bar should be higher than this monstrosity."
gaming,"&gt; along with Who Framed Roger Rabbit

I don't think you truly appreciate how much of a movie making marvel that movie was..  They were the first to do it,  the best to do it, and the only ones who will ever be able to do it properly (with every major property appearing bar a couple)..

Also,  the screenplay wasn't written by chimpanzees."
gaming,Haven’t played that garbage since launch
gaming,"If every frame took 1 hour then it would take 14 years just to render a 90 minute movie.

Sure SOME scenes may take hours but the vast majority absolutely do not even come close to that. 

6 hours per frame puts you at 1 whole week just to render a single second of footage."
gaming,"Good points! It's really interesting just how much goes into these things. I understand a bit about it but it's constantly surprising just what it takes. 

They could just burn the whole building down with all copies of the movie and claim insurance. That might work!!"
gaming,"Hmm, fair enough. I can definitely respect that, making them stand out a little more from each other.

The turtles just didn't seem *fun* to me. That's where the Nickelodeon cartoon really nailed it, I think. Really, my only gripe was Mikey being *such* an idiot (and also, I this his headband should've been the opposite, and super *long*, as opposed to being super short, which was kinda boring to look at)."
gaming,and making *slight* changes to the formula (narrow down to one left alive instead of respawning and competing for highest number of kills)
gaming,Mortal kombat in my opinion
gaming,I'd say there's a cost analysis done and it's firmly in the 'fuck it that'll do' category.
gaming,"Here's a pretty in-depth review for those who are interested..  
[https://ideas.walmart.ca/days-gone-review/](https://ideas.walmart.ca/days-gone-review/)"
gaming,"If *that* was their goal, they failed spectacularly... The one on the left is nightmare fuel uncanny valley, the one on the right looks way more kid-friendly"
gaming,"And anyone who cares enough to complain what Sonic looks like is going to go see it, regardless of whether it's good or bad."
gaming,"The thing about this look is that it's now a cartoon and not representing a supposed living character that could somewhat exist as an organic creature. They are not making Roger Rabbit here...what works as anime/2d/3d video game art doesn't really work next to real life. 

This looks more like a breakfast cereal mascot that jumps off the box than a believable character that is on screen for 1.5 hours."
gaming,The rabbit is at least using the seat belt. Sonic is being a terrible role model.
gaming,"Recently, Anthem. Not only for the problems within the game, but also the way bioware has been handling everything. I just feel so let down, especially after the latest garbage twitch stream. 

Its the worst experience over all that I've ever had with a game."
gaming,I see like 10 on my way to work every morning
gaming,"No joke, this is pretty much it."
gaming,"Why can't you? Like, legitimately curious. Why not? Who would be bothered by that?

I seriously don't see why studios think they need to shapeshift these beloved characters into mutants and aliens and give them ""realistic"" backstories."
gaming,"It looks like a lot of things might resemble what happens in the comics, what with Jim Carrey having various stages of transitioning towards the more traditional Eggman/Robotnik look.

One thing that always made sonic cooler as a whole to me is that Robotnik would literally turn animals into robots and then mind enslave them. An earlier model of his machine he used only [trapped animals inside machines as the power source](https://youtu.be/DzPpRPDRQvA?t=1727) (equally horrifying). Made Robotnik seem like so much more of a threat."
gaming,"Nice skin , what's the name of it ?"
gaming,I just feel like alot of people nowadays wouldnt recognize it or not bother with watching the old film.
gaming,Most of the time? [Yes](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264396/frequency-of-going-to-the-movies-in-the-us/). Maybe you are richer than average and can go to the movies as many times as you like but you are definitely in the minority. Lmao
gaming,Yea man. Idk. It looms terrible. I'm watching for ace Ventura.
gaming,did any one else make a custom map with a spawn point as a hole in the ground that was big enough for starting units but so small escape was impossible? you built a giant army only to drive over and annihilate.
gaming,"Imagine how fucking huge those eyes would have been seeing him faces towards the camera. Not saying this design is good but I for one think it’s not that bad. Considering how bad the franchise has been handled at least something new is happening.
Although, I’m not AT ALL convinced this movie is going to be good, but hey, at least we get Jimmy so thats always something. 

Also, in preparation for all the down votes I’ve already stretched my anus as much as the design of the original sonic has been."
gaming,That's what happen when you collect and eat yellow onion rings. Someone just beat him to make him throw it all up.
gaming,Horror genres have come a long way
gaming,Skyrim Sanic is a better representation than what I saw in the trailer.
gaming,"18000, wasn't it? But that was hardly staying in the forest."
gaming,"I wish more people got this.  There was one where it was literally just the cartoon version with some shading.  In this movie, Sonic's not a cartoon character.  He has to be able to interact with the world.  He's not made of ink or clay.  He has to have teeth because he has a mouth.  He has to have muscles and hair because he's a mammal."
gaming,"This is so much better, so much less uncanny valley, I would watch the movie if Sonic looked like this."
gaming,"If that’s the case, Monster Hunter World might be perfect for you! There are some fights that are heavily encouraged to do with three other players, like Kulve Taroth or Behemoth, but if you’re ok with that then definitely go for it!"
gaming,"All I can say is to look into translation software. The stuff that goes to Steam is pure trash. 

There's a large market of both, just mostly only the sex stuff gets translated.

Also, 3d girls are better."
gaming,"Lmao I’m the fact that you’re a ignoramus and thought oh look my “ widdle cute paper has all the answers “ when in reality they have that paper literally at the front desk 😂. You’re such an idiot . And what are you doing on a gamer sub ? You’re not a gamer , I can guarantee that you’re one of those poser girls who tries to act “special and cute “ by wearing those thick framed “nerd “ glasses pretends to like anime and video games . Did your daddy not give you enough attention that now you have to pretend you’re some gamer girl in order to get validation from men . Posers make me sick"
gaming,The movie sonic looks like one of those bad police sketch drawings described to the artist by someone who had sonic described to them by someone else.
gaming,"Don't forget that by changing sonic's height, any real actor who was looking at ""him"" before will now be looking over his head."
gaming,Check firmware I have the 700 for ps4. Had to return it once for a brand new one and the other day for some reason the Bluetooth didn't sync.
gaming,And hell is a bit warm.
gaming,"I definitely will, but in a couple of years!"
gaming,[What am I looking at](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/rdzfp1g)
gaming,The AI actually has a slightly longer delay on all inputs than the human pros. It's reaction time is slower.
gaming,"I mean, we are literally about to get Detective Pikachu and it looks awesome. paramount just has this weird fixation with turning childhood nostalgia characters into horrific mutants/aliens to give them a ""realistic"" backstory."
gaming,Chris Farley would’ve made an amazing Robotnik
gaming,This is the most generous review I’ve seen of this game....
gaming,"It does.   It's actually a good movie with a competent director and a producer with a big enough hollywood dick to actually make it happen (Spielberg).

Could you imagine the film studios of today lending their highly valuable assets (and in some cases, mascots) to a film that is only tangentially related to them."
gaming,"How does this game compare to Chivalry?

Looks similar and I get the feeling ""I played this years ago"" because of that game... But that genre had a lot of potential I don't think think they ever really tapped into."
gaming,Is she in white face? Or is its a weird photoshop job?
gaming,"Why did they try to make him look human? He's already a supersonic blue animal that can break metal cars apart...what was the thought process? ""MAN this character is crazy,  unbelievably crazy...tell the art team to scale back the crazy and make him more......human. This will make the whole story more believable!"""
gaming,Probably because a full-CGI Sonic series already exists? I think this is an attempt to do something new/trendy with the IP.
gaming,Almost easier just to restart.
gaming,Which PC can also do so that’s not really a point. That’s like saying I prefer PC because I like to sit at a desk and play. Consoles can be hooked up to monitors.
gaming,"Because it is a team game, and it is extremely selfish and rude to deliberately ruin the experience for your teammates."
gaming,Its the tough that counts
gaming,"I agree with this. He definitely looks weird, but if he was a copy/paste of the original design then it probably wouldn't mesh with the live action very well (especially having one giant eye and twiggy limbs).

To me he looks like a weird alien, which looks to be exactly what they're going for, but he looks like he belongs in that universe with real people."
gaming,Yeah but that’s different. That has millions of polygons and textures and all that technical shit and it IS the scene. This CGI/live action style would be a LOT quicker since a lot of the scenes don’t have much CGI going on compared to Finding Nemo
gaming,"However, dark below's raid had crota referenced in vinalla destiny. And it introduced more new armor sets than d2. Most of the armor was recycled from d1. I can see your point though."
gaming,He's doing god's work.
gaming,$24.99 on Steam for those interested: https://store.steampowered.com/app/774201/Heavens_Vault/
gaming,"Yeah, dota players often get confused thinking the complexity of a game means it's better. The miss the fact that dota is better than lol because it's better balanced and every hero is viable at every level of the game."
gaming,The sarcasm is coming from inside the house.
gaming,Thanks and your girlfriend is a keeper marry her
gaming,"I've played both, DOTA's community is much worse, by a long mile. Not as bad as HoN but damn, that community was something else."
gaming,"Getting the controller to work is as easy as just plugging it in. PCs aren’t these giant weird puzzles anymore. Aside form actually building it but you can pay someone to do that. 

As for getting it on TV, same as a console."
gaming,even in the old cartoon show he was dr robotnik
gaming,Same here. Lost 3 of my skins for no reason and Epic didn't want to do shit.
gaming,"Damn, maybe I was looking at that game with rose colour glasses... smh Nostalgia got the best of me again!"
gaming,"I dunno man, even though I used to love Jim Carrey that part looks kinda garbage too. The trailer used a bit they straight ripped off from Austin Powers. Not even the most original or unique bit either.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fK8mneO8yvU&amp;t=0m20s"
gaming,Divinity Original Sin 2. Ive been playing with a friend and its the most fun we've had in a while.
gaming,Actually considering that 1-10 scale works more like 6-10 scale any scores lower than 7 means absolute crap
gaming,"But that's a whole town of toons all explained in the plot, this will be just one random cartoon character in the real world."
gaming,Fond memories playing this game as a kid. Jak II was the hardest one lol
gaming,"If they play videogames, they shouldn’t be that bad"
gaming,This game was great.
gaming,"That's true - and to be fair, it does actually create quite the change in dynamic."
gaming,"Your submission has been removed because we do not allow redd.it link posts except for static images. Why? Our spam controls get screwed up by the v.redd.it domain.  Please use Youtube to host videos or imgur/gfycat for gifs, thanks!


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/gaming) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
gaming,"People shit on Scorpion King when it came out, that cgi was God-awful even then."
gaming,"I've been watching a lot of the *Sonic Boom* cartoon as of late, and I'm honestly more used to the Boom version now."
gaming,Then just wait i guess
gaming,"I used to rage, then I lost the free time to play dota anymore. I’m much happier overall now"
gaming,Please describe the image so I don’t have to click it
gaming,Yeah it's weird. Even the late 90s/early 00s look was cool.
gaming,Stop ruining video games
gaming,"I mean, who cares? It's a Sonic movie, just do it and don't explained it. Kids won't give a shit, and parents are going to take their kids regardless."
gaming,Just 90s-early 00s humor that wasnt that funny then and certainly isn’t now. I felt like he was one sentence away from “I know you are but what am I!?”
gaming,"There's one in there that's well good. Longer legs, smaller torso. Looks ace. It's not that much of a change either. Someone at Paramount needs to have the balls to make them change the model. Literally everyone hates it."
gaming,"Thanks, I hate it."
gaming,Woot Woot for the last scene of the movie!!!
gaming,"I'm a dota player, and I agree with you about how lol is rewarding in it's graphics and generally abilities look more powerful in lol, like when you pull off a cool play as lissandra or cass, it looks super sick imo, but I just love the gameplay of dota and different item builds and positioning can really affect the pace of the game. Using a terrible analogy here, but playing lol feels like a battle(which is really cool), while playing dota feels like a war."
gaming,You know he plays that shit everyday and gets his ass kicked haha
gaming,"I was hesitant due to a few poor reviews but the more I read the more it seemed like people either didn’t understand the game or had been affected by big bugs. 

Anyway, I picked it up after some heavy patches had been rolled out and I can honestly say it’s a great game, however it’s pretty niche. 

I pitched my perfect game to my friend a few years back and it was something like this:

Huge open world
Zombies
Progression character upgrade tree
Scavenging
Crafting
Point of the game is survival, nothing more

With the exception of the last point, Days Gone is all those things but you use a motorbike to get around.

I’m really enjoying it so far, the story is also surprising engaging and I really like the protagonist, despite reviews saying he was shallow but I do wonder the quality of a reviews that reviewed this game in the space of 24-48 hours. 

Anyway, if you like a bit of red dead undead nightmare crosses with mad max, get it, you won’t regret it."
gaming,"Played the first Destiny very regularly with a man in my raid group who was over 60 and retired. Loved games, and he was one of the best during the raids. He'd shit on most of us in PVP as well. I was always pretty impressed. If he never spoke, I'd have just assumed he was another 20 something year old dude playing with us."
gaming,"Lmfao, I'm a dude. I've been gaming since windows 98 but have a job and hobbies besides gaming so i dont feel the need to stay on top of this shit. For being someone who clearly possesses a superior intellect, you sure did just to the lowest form of arguement awfully quickly. Insults are the easiest way to show someone you have no idea how to present or deconstruct an arguement."
gaming,I want to know too because I played against a blind nurse
gaming,"A lot better than chivalry.

They need to fix the damn servers though. Ik they're working on it, but pings are insane on larger servers because of the crazy amount of people playing"
gaming,"Spot on review

The negativey around days gone is insanely bizarre.

The argument is that it's JUST GOOD. It doesn't do anything different/new that they made a good game is somehow a bad thing.

It has a user score of 7.9 on metacritic and metascore of 7.2. I know people tend to vocalise negativity more but complaining that a game is just good and isn't a masterpiece is just stupid as hell."
gaming,"\*BUMP\*

I wonder if it's like legendary athletes who are not as physically fit as their younger counterparts but are still technically proficient af and smarter about their play. Like maybe if you're ""avid"" enough of a gamer for a good amount of time, then you could develop your skills and play to somewhat counter the effects of aging. So I hope!"
gaming,Blizzard defines 'dried up' in terms of passion. Not surprised in the slightest
gaming,"I actually never played watchdogs 1. It was ridiculed for it massive graphic downgrade and poor story, so I never tried it. I'll have to get it some time"
gaming,That's quite the appropriate username.
gaming,- 4000 hours of playtime
gaming,Good news for you is someone has slowly been working on a project to remaster Sonic 06. Its looking good actually. https://youtu.be/FVEkZO7KE8U
gaming,Upload to youtube and download from youtube
gaming,This kid is garbage.
gaming,"Scythe ends up being more of an engine building game with some 4X stylings, and is much much shorter.  TI is more of your space 4X style game with the potential for epic political maneuvers and blunders.

Love both of them though."
gaming,This fucker looks like the Model used in the Movie
gaming,I like LoL but it does suck haha
gaming,"I am over 40. And not really in terms of reflex, but my taste in games have changed. As for gaming performance i can afford top end gear so a lot more picky on quality items and customizing than putting up with keyboard and mouse only."
gaming,I played bf1 with my girlfriends dad who was near 60 always had a positive k/d played the OBJ every match running and gunning. I don’t think age affects performance I think it’s just getting lazy and not trying as hard
gaming,Like when I would play Axis &amp; Allies.
gaming,I see you haven’t legendaried any of them.
gaming,Lol if every kid had that insurance would not cost an arm and a leg for teen drivers
gaming,"My brother has them, the gameplay works like the old Game &amp; Watch handhelds. (Graphics looks like a calculator) 
Me personally, don't care much for them."
gaming,"Ah yes, the sound of frienship. Screaming and then silence."
gaming,Operantly you should spend more time in the library
gaming,"I last played season 3.
Started playing again this week. They left Leona, morgana and Naut alone, so I’m settled."
gaming,"True! I've never been great with words generally, when speaking my anxiety trips me up and when writing I stumble just as much :')"
gaming,"""Cosplay"", blue spandex even a guy could do. Shame on r/gaming"
gaming,Playing the base game on 360
gaming,Most likely msi afterburner with rtss for osd
gaming,"I can't really contest to Far Cry or The Division, and Watch Dogs was just trash, but Origins and Odyssey is and was Awesome. A vast open world with impactful decision that will shape the world, the maps for both ar just vast and detailed. Although there are missed opportunities with the lack of sea monsters they make up for it with Atlantis, the first blade, the mythological creatures one gets to fight. Take it from someone that got tired of the assassin creed games, they have absolutely outdone them selves with both Origins and odyssey."
gaming,Yeah but this is r/thirstygamers.
gaming,Sonic look like he belong in this parade!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4In8NRkOUb0
gaming,Risk of Rain 2?
gaming,RTS games just aren't popular enough to be making anymore.
gaming,Why isn’t it called a Prickle?
gaming,Umm maybe thats a Salty Chevrolet limited edition?
gaming,"It always made more sense. Consoles are niche, with things like community and exclusives as the incentives"
gaming,Division 2 borderlands 2/3 when it comes out. Destiny 2
gaming,Still in alpha iirc.  But they’ve added a shit ton of stuff.  My grandkids are gonna love this game when it’s finally released.
gaming,Would've preferred Nick Offerman.
gaming,Destiny 2: Forsaken. Just be prepared to live for the grind.
gaming,I too have never legendaried any of mine. I was too scared at starting back some.
gaming,"Yeah, if only he would have fixed the eyes."
gaming,You bought a midrange GPU then. They can absolutely do 4k 120hz now. It’s just crazy expensive. The time cost is moving more into a $$$ cost.
gaming,"In the 93 SonicAtAM release he was. But in every single release since 1998s Sonic Adventures he has been Eggman.
In the original game releases he was ""Eggman"" everywhere except America for whatever reason, but that was corrected"
gaming,Looks like one of Robbie Rottens disguises
gaming,"&gt; but the weird shape

so how would you judge the internet reaction thus far?"
gaming,Stardew valley! Love the hell out of that game
gaming,My local Walmart is a dead zone. We could have a long lost treasure hidden in there and only the local meth heads would know.
gaming,I bet Benji’s Revenge is good
gaming,"Division 1&amp;2, Borderlands 1&amp;2, Destiny 1&amp;2"
gaming,"It's rainy as hell where I live for the next week and this post makes me want to just order a bunch of food, invite the boys over, and crack open some cold ones over a big tabletop game.  And I don't even play board games."
gaming,I mean people spend as much on food/drinks as the ticket when they do go and usually theaters have a day of the week where tickets are half off. And well when I was in high school people would stay and watch other movies for free but that’s not what I was talking about. 50% don’t go to the movies cuz they can watch movies for free
gaming,"I legendary alchemy, smithing, illusion, alteration, and sneak. Easiest ones to get back up."
gaming,"Not as bad as people make it out to be, I love the original but EA has been moving this game in the right direction lately. And I'm not a big fan of EA."
gaming,# S U P E R  T H I C C
gaming,RoR2 is NOT a looter shooter lol. You don't keep anything at the end of each session basically.
gaming,Upvote for the white version of monster
gaming,"You keep speaking from a perspective that it's hard or challenging while other people are talking about the time taken. No one is saying having to re-render every single scene with sonic in it is hard, you are the only one who has mentioned difficulty. they're saying it

&gt;takes massive amounts of time and money.

which is the truth, so I don't know why you're commenting against that."
gaming,"you definitely get more crafty. I'm 37 y/o, play a lot of Battlefield series and usually finish in top 5 on the server. This is not because I'm such an aim phenon, but years of experience make up for my somewhat lacking hand-eye coordination."
gaming,"Yeah, I get it if people want to cosplay easily, but buying a pre-printed onesie and slipping it on isn't impressive."
gaming,This oddly brought back memories of young me messing with tint and contrast while playing Sonic games.
gaming,"Nier Automata, it has a great soundtrack. Unique storytelling too, can’t believe I’ve put off playing it for so long."
gaming,Assassins creed just sucks
gaming,"My mom is in her mid 40's and she picked up destiny 2 just last year, just this month I've been helping her get much better at pvp and she's doing really well, scaling up sensitivity was the main thing here, I see her doing well on the daily now and getting positive kd."
gaming,I'm not commenting against the fact that it takes time and money.  I'm commenting against the fact that rendering is the reason that it would be so expensive/time consuming.  Get the context from my earlier replies and it'll make more sense.
gaming,"Well I need to get my eyes checked then, or play more sonic"
gaming,I legitimately hoped that destiny was going to be the game that just had affordable dlc's. When destiny 2 was announced I quit.
gaming,"I might get flak for this, and I'm team PC, but you end up paying quite a bit for upgrades to processor and graphics card in order to keep up with the latest games.  maybe not quite as much as a new console.  There is also a lot of shit that comes with owning a PC, especially self built, and it is a constant learning process.  A hobby in itself, which is actually something I enjoy about it.  The marketability of consoles is the ability to walk in to a store and buy one, knowing it will turn on and do what its supposed to.  Warranty and tech support as well.  There are also no questions about ""will my xbox one be able to play this game on ultra settings"" or "" will my antivirus or realtek audio manager interfere with the game."""
gaming,never heard of this but it looks amazing
gaming,So does hotdog on a stick
gaming,The set up i need as an adult.

gaming,Are you doing a written Christopher Walken impression?
gaming,So are the amount of times this has been posted.
gaming,"I agree man. They ruined Minecraft anyway ages ago. 

Ever played Rust? Like DayZ gameplay PvP mixed with high levels of crafting"
gaming,"I won't argue with you there, just reseeding the information since it seems like a lot of people believe Sega had a huge hand in this."
gaming,I told you to keep things civil.
gaming,"Not sure if it actually affects my abilities, but I definitely need a couple of warm up games to get into it. I find Apex is quite a good game to play a couple of rounds of before starting a long session with my buddies - it's fast paced and gets your old juices going :)"
gaming,"Oh i know lol,  but having the world not clash with the characters helps"
gaming,Lol no excuse. I finish full games while neglecting my bf. You can too. I guess it’s good I didn’t remember the guys name so it’s not the biggest spoiler for you
gaming,"I'm 39 years old, my reflexes aren't as good as what it used to be for fighting games. haha"
gaming,the detective pikachu movie proves it cpuldve been done better. whoever designed that abomination has seen one picture of sonic at most
gaming,"If everyone understands the game and how to play, it usually takes about 30 mins per player. Depends on how quickly everyone does their turns."
gaming,I played it all last night and yea I had some packet loss and stuttering now and then I didn't really have any issue tbh it still played fun as hell
gaming,Thank you it's nice hearing that.
gaming,He's not wrong (and also probably diamond+)
gaming,He drives no different than the online players.
gaming,"Exactly, can the character still reach the door handle, is the actor looking 2 feet above his head now, if his legs are a new length, can he cover that distance in 2 steps or do we need to retime the shot so he can casually stroll over in 3 steps instead. The guys who made sure his hair didn't intersect that chair he sits in, they are starting over. Is he too short to be seen in this live action camera? All this needs to happen before rendering. 

At this point in the production, half the crew has moved off to other jobs by now, so are we calling these folks back, finding new people to hit the ground running? 

So many questions to answer before even being able to THINK about rerendering..."
gaming,"Man I loved Japanese dating sims back in the day. The old ones were so ridiculous hard. Say one wrong thing, and the peep you trying to woo would basically politely tell you to fuck off and you'd get the bad ending.  We didn't have walkthroughs way back then so I had to talk to a bunch of other players  in fan forums about our dialogue  trees. Good times.   The most recent one I played was an Osomatsu-san one, and it was fucking hilarious. It basically made fun of you for playing it the entire time."
gaming,Cut it some slack. It's an anime for children. I liked it when I was a little kid.
gaming,Depends. I was for the most part interested in progressing and competing RDR2. AC Origins was more of a chore.
gaming,"It's hard to judge because most of what I've seen so far is clearly coming from existing fans of Sonic. Honestly, until everyone started complaining, I wasn't even aware of the movie."
gaming,"What do you mean that a slightly odd character design in an inconsequential movie isn't considered ""terrifying"" to most people?"
gaming,Still a better looking sonic than the movie

gaming,"Of course it clashes, point is... it would've clashed even harder with the cartoony look."
gaming,Its the symbols for the StarCraft races

gaming,"43 year old here still play fps games alot even though my hand eye coordination is a little slower. Experience can often help  alot especially with positioning and game sense.
A couple of years ago I thought I'd lost the aiming altogether. Went to see the doctor for an annual check up he referred me to an optician and after getting spectacles my aim returned, currently at my highest rank in overwatch, and thinking of returning to destiny 2 to raid. (I quit d1 thinking I couldn't aim anymore lol) ."
gaming,"This is true, they really did a hard work and made a beautiful graphics and huge map, but what's the point when experience quality is very low."
gaming,"Next step is to legendary and get enough stat points to max everything.

And... go!"
gaming,Do you mean the ones that emulated megadrive(genesis) and Atari games? Your gonna want to look into emulating megadrive(genesis) and Atari arcade games.
gaming,"I'll go ahead and say it.  There has never been a ""good"" live action movie based on a Video Game. There have been some that are fun (like Resident Evil or Mortal Kombat).  There have been those that are decent in an inoffensive type way (like Doom or Silent Hill) but there really has never been a good one to set the genre on fire.  

When X-men (2000) came out it was a revelation.  You could make a superhero movie that took the material seriously and people other than ""the nerds"" would go and see it.  It heralded the start of an entire generation dominated by films based on comics.  

Video game movies haven't had that watershed moment yet.   Save for maybe a couple exceptions, the films have had almost zero crossover appeal.  Sometimes they're kind of fun for people who play the games, but to pretty much every other film-goer they're dogshit."
gaming,That new Fade to Silence game looks pretty dope. Not quite AAA but it looks unique enough.
gaming,Beautiful face just because I'm not an ass hole

gaming,"I like the golf club, I have the original on Ps4, the one with the developer doing the commentary, which is sarcastic and hilarious. It reminded me of old DOS golf games where you could download a million different crazy assed courses. There were some really weird ones uploaded to the original golf club because the database was shared with PC.

I heard there was a follow up, but never played it. I still boot up the original when I'm bored and play a few rounds."
gaming,Jak 2 was sick and yeah hard. 3 was the best- spent so many hours playing that. I want a pc port or something:(
gaming,"Roger Rabbit didn't just have 1 cartoon character in a world that's supposed to be normal

Roger Rabbit was literally set in a world where toons and humans co-existed, and the tone of the movie worked because of the way that everything was shot and set up. It looked like it belonged. It doesn't here, Sonic is obviously an outsider, which makes him clash ridiculously with the setting he's in, and it would've been far worse had he been Cartoon Sonic."
gaming,That is the joke...this thing is chalked full of memes and references
gaming,"So all the money would just go to.. who’s making this panoramic? 

Well if that’s the case I still wanna see Jim Carrey but not give em money"

gaming,"Cheers, I was going a bit nuts there! Nice job btw."
gaming,"This review and some of the user feedback here just convinced me to buy this off ps store.

Looking forward to some creepy zombie hunting after work."
gaming,that thing is not human wtf  thats a fucking alien
gaming,"To a degree, yes. But not to this point."
gaming,"Oh my god, you ripped even this off DotA."
gaming,I would have known that if I watched it. I would have watched it for sure if there were nude scenes.
gaming,"Yeah, tried it
I love football but it just doesent gets me
Im kinda more like a keyboard mouse guy"
gaming,"I'm an American living in France, and soda is still called soda here (it's a masculine noun in French). If I wanted a sparkling water I would ask for an eau gazeuese or an eau pétillante (both mean sparkling water). Having lived on three continents and traveled to four, I can't think that I've ever encountered a lack of clarity over the term 'soda.'"
gaming,"No joke, this was exactly what I did. I saw that the images didn't match, so I decided to go to the comments to see what was up. Then it became the misplaced block."
gaming,Nah what I meant was like sonics connected eyeballs while not being the main appeal to his character design it is a feature that makes him unique in comparison to other mascots like Mario whose just an italy boy with an artificial mustache.
gaming,AAA survival game would be full of microtransactions and shallow gameplay. Ark and rust are probably the best we are ever going to get. Sadly
gaming,His original comment that my response was to is asking whether the scar in the pic was a burn scar. Don't let his bs catch up to you too. Reposting things is one thing. Taking credit for somebody else's permanent injury and cover up tattoo is damn close to stolen-valour.
gaming,That was a good game. The original XBOX. That was the peak right there.
gaming,Minecraft: 2009 / Fortnite: 2017

gaming,"&gt; What’s so important about that day?

BTW, it that a quote from Raiden? Somewhere from the beginning of the game, you sneaky sneak!?"
gaming,"Warframe by far one of the best, no need to spend a single penny and they keep coming up with more and more content (Weapons, Maps, Enemies, Characters and so on). Better Gameplay than most loot n shoot"
gaming,"Same shit, different day."
gaming,So what do you use your vita for exactly? I've always seen them and considered grabbing one for cheap but I've never heard of any must have games on it.
gaming,[Look at me. I am de pit dog now.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HOP7cQDmz4)
gaming,Oh I get you bro. Well hopefully someone suggest a good game for you.
gaming,"I had this debate for long time, but I bough PS4 PRO and I never regret it since."
gaming,"Have you tried minecraft with the mod packages? 

I.e sevtech, FTB, Infinity. (250+ mods modpacks) they are definitely NOT kid friendly. 

Besides that, I cant think of much. Played all the games and i have to agree with you."
gaming,Nope. Just a Woodforest Bank and a Cost Cutters... a man can dream.
gaming,"Not going to lie, ET is genuinely less jarring."
gaming,I just a title don't be too literal a bout it

It’s super-disturbing!"
gaming,Thank u well I hope so too
gaming,How many years did you waste?
gaming,"Yes, new phone's autocorrect isn't up to par. 
I recommend turning your autocorrect off for a bit and seeing how you do."
gaming,Add in a mini farm with few vegetables and animals with a mini fridge and freezer and you don’t need to go grocery shopping anymore
gaming,"Same for me , hollow knight is my favorite game of all time , and I play lots of great games but it was the best."
gaming,"I hear this all the time but it's never been my experience on either NA or EUW. The reality is that only a minority of players ever play ranked, so for many people normal is the only mode they ever play. I don't find my normal games are any worse than my ranked on average, the real problem in normals is if someone who only plays ranked comes in and has a wildly different normals MMR, but that's pretty rare."
gaming,"While I do enjoy assassins creed,  their open world has been getting kinda stale.  Problem with a lot of open worlds I played,  it's not very interactive. Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2 made the world more lived in and made it more fun to explore. Like I would find small stories and unknown side missions in red dead I would never have seen unless I explored and that's what made it exciting. Witcher 3 did some things like that,  where exploring ended up finding unknown side stories.  (Also I loved the side quests in witcher 3. They never felt like a chore since I was so into their stories) Assassin creeds side stories and exploring aren't exciting. You're  finding the same thing over and over and side stories are bland."
gaming,That puts a smile on my face
gaming,I love how every villain in 80's toy cartoons had super shrill voices.
gaming,Because kids with lots of money certainly don't like video games...
gaming,"I was Team PC/computer since the early 80s. Picked up an Xbox back in the day and simply found it easier to chill in the recliner and play on the TV.
Picked up a 360 then PS4 Pro w/VR and love them both. I have a PC with wireless keyboard and mouse on the TV but use that mainly for games from GOG.
It’s a personal choice with no wrong answer."
gaming,I’m sick of the games that they choose to make open world. But the open world isn’t the problem.
gaming,"Three words, Castle Miner Z"
gaming,"I don’t think I was better at any other video game than this one.

k."
gaming,"here we have the league virgin, meanwhile us dota chads THRIVE"
gaming,Lol is a broken ass game. It's just snowballing
gaming,Fortnite bad minecraft good
gaming,"Pikachu looks just like his source material though.

This is stylized to make Sonic look more... human?  He just looks bizarre and disturbing."
gaming,He’s probably hard stuck Plat.
gaming,No joke that actually looks really cool. Ignore the sperging fucks who downvote.
gaming,Man some of those games are great. Who doesn't want to romance pigeons?
gaming,I found scythe to be sort of a crapshoot in balance based on combinations of abilities and boards.  Fun long game but a bit overhyped.
gaming,"Keep in mind render farms we use in the industry also farm out groups of frames across dozens to hundreds of machines. From personal experience, I would say an hour a frame is pretty common, but have seen render times from a few minutes to almost 24 hours depending on the software and complexity of the fx rendered.

A lot of people brag about those times, like they're breaking ground with their massive render times. In reality it's usually a sign you're overcomplicating a simple problem..."
gaming,lol. bro... experience counts WAY more towards success than youth.
gaming,"My mother plays Solitaire and cheats at it.

There's no explaining why some people do what they do."
gaming,It makes no sense for him to have white fur on his body and peach fur on his face. It's a terrible design.
gaming,I meant this in regard to those negating such reactions. I probably should have made that clearer...
gaming,"this game has crazy potential but if it ever reaches that potential remains to be seen, and it is going to take years and years to reach it."
gaming,the left picture doesn't even look like human its so fake
gaming,"Thanks for the heads up. I loved every single assassins creed game, but this one, yeah, it’s just a bunch of chore. 

Do you know if Oddesy is any better?"
gaming,"I have never had such big problems with downloads on a ps4 so I reccomend buying that of you don't want to get a pc, but I think it would be overall better to buy a pc"
gaming,Man I feel you there I hate when I get into a rut like that we’re u just spend more time thinking about what to play then load up a game just to back out an try another to no avail lol. What I do is go back an jump on an older system for example my ps2 or xbox 360 an play some of my old fav games an sometimes have like a game night with my buddies an play tons of split screen games on the old systems an have pizza an shit lol
gaming,"Agreed. I work in design, and after a while of beating my head against a wall, I just give in and do whatever they say and take my paychecks. I can be an artist when I'm off the clock."
gaming,"I wanna upvote this twice, haha."
gaming,Sounds like what they do in the front room of the Esports Arena in Vegas.
gaming,"Yea, I googled it and it's basically that."
gaming,If you don’t have internet your computer would be useless.
gaming,"Had to google this cuz all of you confused the crap out of me. I only ever knew him as Dr. Robotnik.  


""**Robotnik**"" is the character's real name while ""**Eggman**"" is a ""common name taken after his shape.""   


WTF internet...."
gaming,"Mine has one as well. You will notice that every computer inside them is Cyberpower. The premade gaming PC brand that Walmart purchased some time ago.  It is not an abbertition.

EDIT  Walmart owned OVERPOWERED, not CyberpowerPC. However, the business model is not only at his store, and has appeared in more than just this one location.  Same business names, (seemingly) same hardware setups, and super similar schedules for specific games on specific nights.  Sounds like they are following SOPs of some sort, indicating a larger business venture than just a single location small business. etc."
gaming,You ever tried The Forest? Not a AAA game but it is a very good Crafting Survival Game. If you haven’t checked it out I’d suggest giving it a look.
gaming,"For a dedicated troll account, you’re a really shitty troll.

Absolutely no wit involved, no build up, and no substance to the act. You just come out the gates swinging against the first person who you can argue against... that’s not trolling, that’s just being an abusive prick."
gaming,That side mouth though
gaming,Fortunately the developers are in no rush to release a half finished product just to appease some corporate bloathead that wants his cut.  It may take years but it’s going to be a fantastic game when it’s ready.
gaming,Thank you for the reply. I’m going to go buy RDR2 now.
gaming,"This what I have come to. Consoles will just be streaming boxes for games u really don’t even own. Ppl download games but don’t own them. U are paying for a long rental basically. The company can take it away from u but legally they can not. It happened with far cry 4 , anyway I’ll just getting  a pc in the 9th generation."
gaming,That has more to do with it being a different pose.
gaming,a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
gaming,i remember late nights when i was like 5 or 6 sitting in the living room with my sisters trying to beat aladdin. good memories
gaming,"cosplay doesnt mean ""store bought suit"""
gaming,The only conclusion I can come up with is that some producer on is still pissed about the Super Mario Bros. Movie from the 90's and they would be damned if Sonic got a better movie 30 years later so they did everything they could to try an sabotage it.
gaming,"It's pretty far from a good experience, but free is free.

You can hardly even mine right now, there's a critical bug which crashes the game after a few minutes of it."
gaming,What are the four elements?
gaming,Are you asking a question?
gaming,This still looks better than Sonic...
gaming,Play Minecraft but without much armor
gaming,"Finished Professor Layton and the Azran Legacy last week so I’m doing some of the extra content. Definitely buying Layton’s Mystery Journal once I find it

Also this is kind of embarrassing but I still never completed The Perfect Run from Super Mario Galaxy 2 so I’ve been doing that whenever I’ve gotten the chance 😅"
gaming,I always feel like I have too much to play
gaming,"I can only guess 3 - magic, guns (defense) and seeing the beast. No idea what the fourth is"
gaming,"A mini golf game for the wii. Don't remember the name, cuz i threw it away almost immediately after playing."
gaming,Like you guys have a ton of food but aren’t allowed to eat it rich
gaming,What is this app
gaming,I mean you can't even tell she's latina with the amount of make-up she's using.
gaming,That’s how it is with me and Super Mario Galaxy. I have a ton of games I haven’t beaten and it’s mostly because I always go back to this game
gaming,Sounds  good to me. Thanks
gaming,Finally started Super Mario Odyssey last week and I still can’t get enough of it! I am having a serious amount of fun playing this game
gaming,"Yeah, it's really handy and not that expansive, especially for someone like me, who always travel or not at home and have time to kill. I play and recommend Darkest Dungeon, Killzone, Persona 4, XCOM, SAO games, Dragon Ball, One Piece, some puzzle rpgs like Danganronpa. Honestly, there's a big choice of good games"
gaming,"Yeah sounds cool 
Its exactly the same for me
I open a game i feel like i wanna play and then close it right after haha.
Actually I am looking people to play with 
We can play like lol fortnite or literally anything lol"
gaming,This one confuses me because I’ve played the actual game and it’s not bad? I mean it’s your standard base-builder game with a little more polish. They don’t need to lie like this.
gaming,"Jesus Christ. My friend showed me the trailer yesterday, but I never noticed just how badly Sonic fits. It looks like he was photoshopped in by someone with my skill level (by which I mean no skill at all of course)"
gaming,But don't worry the mods of /r/gaming have got her covered. Shit post allowed by shitty mods. They've even removed the ability to enter your reason for reporting a post so that people can't call them out for their shitty moderating. No need to listen to the community if you just mute them.
gaming,Any updates on this project?
gaming,I have tried changing the pcconfig.txt-file and making sure the game is running on the Nvidia processor but it's still unplayable
gaming,"They don't... when you finally find out in Dragon Ball Z. But until then literally no one ever made the suggestion that he's an alien. If Dragon Ball Z didn't exist, Goku would be ""just"" an human with a tail. This little whirlwind of strangeness is usual on anime protagonists, or anime characters in general. There's nothing there that says Goku isn't human. You just think that in hindsight."
gaming,Nier Automata. Hands down one of the best games of this generation. Also check out Sea Of Thieves which just had a content update. There is no character progression other than cosmetics but it’s great fun.
gaming,"Minecraft is actually a good game. Fortnite is like the music you listened to when you were 12, you don’t realize how shit it is yet."
gaming,"I have come to the realization that the Sonic movie has the same plot as Transformers.

An alien species lands on earth and tries to stay secret, but the army wants to capture them so they can use their advancements for militaristic reasons. To escape capture the alien befriends a young boy and girl that have a distant friendship that the boy actually has interest in but cant move forward with to vut with the help of the alien becomes closer as a whole. They elude the army, and with the help of each other carve out a place for the alien to live amongst the world in secret. They must fight robots and have a ton of cgi explosions and win In the end, but UH OH theres now a bigger bad guy on the loose because the alien was introduced to the world. Come back next year for the next movie and pay us."
gaming,Thanks I hate it
gaming,*laughs in 30 army strong Risk*
gaming,What's the con?.....  This post makes no sense.
gaming,"There’s is a drastic difference between movie Sonic and game Sonic. The body, arms, legs, head, face... even the color is different in places! Meanwhile you’re having to nit pick tiny details here and there on the Pikachu design. That a big difference."
gaming,Exactly.  My first grader is *pumped* for this thing.
gaming,"A day later and I still have a visceral reaction to those fucking teeth

&amp;#x200B;

Also: ""WHAT IF \_\_\_\_\_\_ CAME TO THE REAL WORLD??"" is the fucking worst plotline. It's what happens when you hand the franchise to a writer/director who don't know anything about it and care even less."
gaming,I would say the story is is more interesting but overall for me it is a very similar experience. It’s a huge open world with lots to explore but I got burned out rather quickly.
gaming,"Your word, if not your opinion, is honorable. Good man."
gaming,"The game is called Mordhau, and I made the clip.

Edit: I'm now aware that this was posted before I made my post on /r/Mordhau"

gaming,"Well let's have a quick look at the account. Yup.

1 month old, shit ton of post karma, barely any comment karma. 

They're like carbon copies of all the other accounts doing this."
gaming,"Makes me a little sad because when I see her face and how blantant the ""whiteface"" is as it reminds me of that poor cosplayer who did the apex medic ""blackface"" and got swarmed. I am guess the same won't happen to his girl because double standards and all that. Wish people could just cosplay how they wanted with the same standards."
gaming,I love people with opinions this strong it just makes me laugh
gaming,"It only became that way because Riot started actually banning people for flame. The community didn't improve, it got bullied into submission (which is overall a good thing)."
gaming,"DAMN that's a tough one. It'd probably be a Sonic game of some sort, but not 06. That's too easy. Nah the worst for me is Secret Rings. For as bad as 06 controls, the ones in SR are a fucking farce. Tilt the wiimote forwards to move forwards, but not TOO far or you'll go backwards. Tilt left or right to steer as you go down a linear corridor. Press 1 to skid across the ground, press 2 to jump and then thrust the wiimote forward to do an air dash. It is MISERY. And the game looks bad, being on the Wii and all, the scenery is nice but the story is pretty bad and lacks any real stakes. Like they'd SERIOUSLY consider even potentially killing off Sonic in the story, literally after 06 and that fiasco with Elise. I guess I hate Forces more for it's horrible story, cynical nature and just overall lack of polish, but Secret Rings is the worst to play, for me, period.

Outside of Sonic, the other worst would likely be Medal of Honor: Warfighter. I'm generally quite tolerant of mil shooters if they have good controls, but Warfighter is the most boring game I've ever played. I fell asleep playing it, no joke."
gaming,"Dont forget to make dumb decisions, and have lame dialogue."

gaming,"It was the character remakes that made me quit.  Started drastically changing classic characters instead of just putting those ideas into new characters.    I didn't care that they (""sucked, were boring, not playable, not viable anymore,  blah blah blah""- league community)   i loves and played them all.    The challenges of trying to win games against players of characters with better/newer skill sets gave me a fun challenge.   Once all my favorites got revamped,  i hated the game.   It started with kat.    I came back for a day, with even intention to look past it, but once i saw they did it to irelia, galio i was done.   
   
Never again will I return unless they give the option to play characters as they were intended."
gaming,Quaffing infinite potions from your inventory that don't have a cast time or cause the horrors to get any closer.
gaming,That’s how you get your game uninstalled instantly
gaming,"The fact that they were able to raise a quarter billion dollars and have still produced next to nothing feels almost like these developers were able to exercise an almost ""cult-like"" influence over their backers.

I mean honestly, I never played Wing Commander as a kid but a lot of people with a lot of disposable income must've loved that shit.   I admit I'm an outsider.  I don't know these devs, I didn't play their games, I didn't back the project.

And I appreciate the crowdfunding concept and I think we've seen some great games come out of it.  But honestly how does a group of people just hand a guy (who BTW hasn't made a game in 15 years) a quarter billion dollars for what is essentially a promise?   Something about that seems outrageously crazy to me."
gaming,Maybe overused characters like cthulhu. He's everywhere right now and it's boring

gaming,This trilogy is fantastic.  Play it yearly.
gaming,Yeh they pay third party companies to make the ads the companys just slap together any old bullshit
gaming,"So, for something like this to happen they need to begin with a concept art. Usually there are a lot of concepts and they'll narrow it down until they find one they like for testing. They'll take those concepts and model them and test some basic animations and lighting to see which ones work and which don't. Once all that's done, they'll take the chosen one and do some test renders to see if it fits alongside the world they made.

This is a months long process and at no point did anyone say ""Y'know, maybe this isn't going in the direction we want."" Which means they made it all the way here, and every step of the way whoever is in charge of decision making on this project said ""Yes, this is exactly how I imagined it.""

Should be a good film."
gaming,"Most champions in the game are really only balanced to be played in one role. This is particularly true for junglers and supports. Essentially, you were handicapping not only yourself but your entire team by playing (presumably) lane Nocturne.

It's not really your fault though. League does an atrocious job with its new player experience (and it's way better now than it used to be. Champion balance is never clearly explained nor is jungling even properly introduced in a real way. You'll end up facing experienced players very early on because smurfing is so common--after several games each smurf will be recognized as such and pushed up into smurf queue, but that doesn't help the genuinely new player who is getting dumpstered in the meantime. The barrier to entry for the game is just too high now unless you have a friend helping you along the way."
gaming,I see what you did there...

5 years in, its a pretty calm response to dying. I pictured this guy basically doing an exorcism on himself when he died and its ""Oh no I died to a zombie"". Wasnt at all what I thought he was going to say or do. Also, jumping down into an unlit cave with no idea whats down there, when you could have stood two blocks up and just pecked at everything.

Yeah, he wanted to die."
gaming,It's even the SAME ACTOR
gaming,"Me. I'd totally want to warn anyone coming after and I'd also totally be panicked enough to fuck up and go ""dont dead open inside"".  
ALso I'd be that npc who for some reason scatters diary pages everywhere and ends his last note with ""aaargh, I die"""
gaming,No it's deeper than that. There's tons of maps and the talent choices and game decisions are a lot more nuanced than new players realize.  Especially ones who come from Lol or DotA with a lot of xp in those games and have set expectations about how they should play
gaming,Yep this is fine. The only problem i had with sonic boom was how stupid knuckles was. Other than that everything was pretty good
gaming,Looks like for the majority of a game of eclipse. Take your fucking move!
gaming,"100 star systems - not a single one finished yet. 2 MOSTLY complete planets. 

Not saying this is a scam, but 300million and nothing yet? Maybe invest in a bigger dev team for starters idk"
gaming,"I don’t think so. There are a lot of people like me, who know sonic tangentially from playing games, but I’m not invested at all. My reaction was “wtf is this why did they make him look like a genetic abomination”. I might have gone to see it but it honestly just looks slapped together"
gaming,Dude got perma-banned for being toxic
gaming,"I just wish games would have options for the tutorials.

I don't need to spend 10 minutes learning how to move around, aim and shoot in an FPS game or how to move the camera and build units in an RTS.

Just give me a tutorial that tells me what's unique/special in your game."
gaming,This is almost the full subreddit
gaming,So are quality posts by the look of it
gaming,"Cringe. I swear, this sub gets lamer every day."
gaming,Its not the BEST game out there but its definitely a cool one.
gaming,The large tear in the back completes this image.
gaming,Someone on Twitter said it needed lips so [I made v2](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D5fcRBcWAAE_T_Y.jpg).
gaming,And then people didnt read the manual and were like: how do i play the game?
gaming,"I'm out of the loop, who is this and what did they do?"
gaming,Not showing up means Activ-llizard still has nothing of interest to reveal for the gaming community and they're continuing down the path of creating trivial mobile products and milking their existing diluted IP.
gaming,Cry 5 days gone?
gaming,Don't link her. that's half the point of these posts. I'm sure she's got a patreon or something somewhere.
gaming,I'd find the list to be questionable at best. Especially if the criteria for being a good looter shooter is being called Borderlands.
gaming,"Oddly enough, to some people, being merely average is somehow worse than being the absolute worst or best. Perhaps because of the whole negativity bias thing, stuff that is genuinely appalling/amazing sticks around in our minds longer. Consider something like Hatred, a game that tried to use this to its advantage and was as shocking as possible in order to get itself in the history books. But people forgot about it almost instantly because it wasn't complete shit - it was crass and incredibly boring. Merely...well, average. We brainless apes like extremes, no moral ambiguity, so we don't have that small niggle on our minds about the bad things that may otherwise bring our experience down.

Frankly, when a game comes out, I want to know three things. 1. Is the game good? 2. Is it worth the price they're flogging it at? 3. How bad is the financial side of it (DLC, Pre-Orders, Microtransactions, Lootboxes, ect)? It may be less impressive when a game does nothing new, but if it does it extremely well I don't really care."
gaming,It’s funny that the virgins making fun of Fortnite kids are the virgins who played Minecraft
gaming,Talking about game journalists eh?
gaming,So is making a clever post that people will actually like
gaming,"Duh. Where else can I get my hair cut, new glasses, then DOTA my day away."
gaming,"only reason for this is because minecraft can be run on shitty computers and fortnite cant. i bet you if you gave most of those minecraft players a decent build they would leave minecraft and moVe to a new game.

edit: anyone who says fortnite can be played on mobile so my comment is invalid well you can play pubg on a fucking phone too but go buy a consumer PC at walmart and try running pubg let me know how that goes."
gaming,what kind of moron actually pays attention to those ads (or any ads)
gaming,"Full disclosure:

I'm a former backer that put a pretty penny into the game, and when I finally realized this project is likely to be doomed it was too late to get a refund.

CIG's official stance is ""wait for a refund specialist"". It's been well over a year...

I went from being a very active contributor on the /starcitizen sub to a regular on /starcitizen_refunds 

I had an incredible amount of faith in this alleged game.

Over the years I didn't preorder EA games (or other games), I bought games on sale and I spend my extra disposable income on Star Citizen. (ok I lied I pre-ordered ME:A because how can it possibly fail - lesson learned).

Everything I saved by buying other games at 80% off - I spend on Star Citizen, and believe over 6 years or so it added up.

I ended up selling many of my ships on the grey market and recouped a lot of the cash back, so I got lucky that way, but many didn't.

Please people do not be a fool like I was. 

It sells nostalgia.  It sells a dream that is not likely to come true.
There are legions of backers who still think this is the greatest game (n)ever made and who'll defend it until the end of time.

Let them fund this thing to a finish line if they want to but don't get bamboozled our of cash the same way I was. 

Let me one last thing clear - I don't want this game to fail, I'd argue that 99.99% of the refund sub wants it to fail.  You don't spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a game if you want it to fail. (when you add what you spend on video games or micro transactions every  years you'll realize it's not actually that weird).

It's not a case of buyers remorse, because that doesn't kick in after you realize what you bought isn't coming.

I should have known better to buy nostalgia. Be smarter than me.

I'm sure I'll get labelled as hater, fudster, Derek Smart alt or some other nonsense by the white knights - so be it.  If I can save one person money by warning them, I'll take the down votes like a champ.

Edit: Spelling."
gaming,"Who forgets that, exactly?"
gaming,"No they did in fact Yoda ET.  Spielberg added scenes with a full on CGI ET and then he also edited all the guns out of the movie because guns offended him after 9-11.  It was so poorly received (much like Lucas' updates) that Spielberg walked back the updates (If only George had done the same).

&amp;#x200B;

If you go buy ET today, it's the same version you always saw.  But there was a period of time where there was a ET special Edition out there with really shit CGI ET scenes all up in it."
gaming,Well yea guess I have to
gaming,"I've seen the needle sway from left to right like an old generator as well.  I gave the game some time (it was indeed slow to start) to mature after I read a review of it on Bloody Disgusting. They mentioned it took about 10 to 15 hours before things started to pick up.  They were , at least I felt, fairly accurate with that.  Now I find my self doing every side mission, hunting for food for the camp(s)-o-choice to boost rep to gain access to better weapons and bike upgrades and of course killing massive groups of zombies along the way as I progress the story.  Totally digging the game and its characters...it is also beautiful looking!"
gaming,"This is going to be unpopular, but i like how Sonic looks. I have a hedgehog, and he looks like a anthromaporfic hedgehog."
gaming,"I tilt when I play league. Really hard. I couldn't tell you why. I didn't used to, I can't even say exactly when it changed. But I've reached points where my body is physically clenched up or even shaking over a league game. I've called my best friend some pretty terrible stuff, and in the heat of the moment I meant every word of it.

I've been pointedly playing less league lately. If I start getting tilted I switch games. I've also been exploring stuff that I haven't played for a long time and I've been reading more. But it doesn't take more than a couple bad league games in a row to put me right back in the tilt zone. I love the champions in league, I love their lore and their worldbuilding, but boy is that game bad for me."
gaming,"Because this ""basic game option"" is still a novelty that is rarely used."
gaming,I can dere-lick my own balls thank you very much
gaming,"This game is all about the combat system and its intriquacies. Controlling your weapon in VR would nullify all of the carefully laid out mechanics and turn the game into something completely different.

I'd still want to see it, though. :)"
gaming,Sonic with a dad bod?
gaming,"What I do for multiplayer games online is just send a bunch of friend request to people in my squad or that are up there in the leaderboards with me an some game have some really awsome an fun commute play with, and or I go on Reddit to one that’s dedicated for that game an make a post looking for people to play with on what system I use an usually works out.  Now I have an ever growing amount of people to play with on most of my online games an usually always atleast some one is on to play with"

gaming,Are severs still full on old BF?
gaming,The forest but I have a splint on so I can't play it for a week 🙁
gaming,"I kind of felt like the ET updates were buried under what George had already done to the Star Wars.  People were already so pissed about Star Wars they just didn't care as much when Spielberg did it to ET.  

&amp;#x200B;

Spielberg had the good grace to dial it back."
gaming,"when you start the game, hit all the buttons on your controller to figure out what they all do.

People don't do that enough when they play new games."
gaming,Grove Street... Home...at least it was until he fucked things up.
gaming,"I think you're right, whenever I've had the opportunity to reference multiple, I've always said 'Nintendo 64s'"

gaming,I smelled that comment and gagged.
gaming,"That is the definition of ""keeper"". Just be as vigilant in caring for her as she does you."
gaming,I primarily play on PC. Only use consoles for the exclusives.
gaming,"yeah.. i mean.. what exactly did people except ? i mean they just wanted to make like the best sci-fi game ever where you can do stuff that you could never do before or stuff that you could do before but better, with better grafics and better everything..but with less experience then the biggest studios. i bet nobody ever tried that before. who cares..

btw, if someone got too much money i want to make a game like morrowind game of thrones the witcher 3 and skyrim combined. it will be bigger and better then all of them combined with better looks and everything. i just need money you know"
gaming,"I thought this was a joke, sadly I had been misinformed."
gaming,Knights of Pen and Paper
gaming,"Sonic The Hedgehog: ""Hold my beer"""
gaming,The Witcher 3. Started it twice but got distracted by other games.
gaming,"Borderlands 1 enhanced, ff7 with new threat mod, forza horizon!

The currently playing but not actively playing list is longer. God of war, spyro trilogy, crash 2 and 3, persona 5... I abandon too many games, it’s a big problem."
gaming,This is so accurate
gaming,The lipstick looks like Peach borrowed the suit.
gaming,"I think unless consoles start becoming modular, they'll get pushed out of the market space by increasingly cheaper pre-built PCs in &lt;15 years."
gaming,"Can't blame them tbh, imagine seeing something you love getting mangled and spit on constantly."
gaming,Fuck little Timmy hes a little shit anyways
gaming,"I mean, apply it to other consoles. Nintendos Wii, Microsofts Xbox, Segas Dreamcast. Doesn't work as well, the N64 just sounds better because pluralizing a number sounds weird."
gaming,Just learned female slavs exist
gaming,"Well, it’s interesting. The movie doesn’t have any overt pro-gay messaging, but to a particular era of, mostly, gay men, it really resonated. Characters like the cowardly lion and Dorothy and their struggles seemed like metaphors for the real life struggles and hopes for a lot of gay men, and combined with the super campy style it quickly became a beloved and mythologized work in such communities.

I doubt it carries quite the same weight to gay men and women of younger generations, but it still retains its landmark status. My observation is that the stylistic depiction of Sonic and company combined with the overall arc of the movie is likely going to resonate with a lot of people who identify as furries—I’m not particularly bothered if a tiny subgroup of people get off to dressing up as animals or what have you, but prepare to potentially see a lot of furry shenanigans centered around this movie.

Or then again, maybe it turns out to be *beyond* bad and no one speaks of it again."
gaming,When lovecraft did it this was all new and a fresh take. It was scary because it was a new way of seeing horror that wasn't religious / mythology based.
gaming,"Thanks for the tip. I really loved assassins creed 4, and this feels like a major step down. I’m also missing the multiplayer from the assassins creed that takes place during the French Revolution (my second favorite A/C game) if you don’t have it, you can buy it in the bargain bin. People still play online despite how old it is 😊"
gaming,"yeah, tentacles just remind me of hentai"
gaming,"Fortnite is fun for a day maximum, Minecraft is forever"
gaming,Only some people forget.
gaming,"no, it does not"
gaming,Clearly we disagree on the matter. Your inability to afford a better GPU does not affect a major movie studio.
gaming,Yup in your opinion what's the best weapon?  Fully upgrades
gaming,Oh I'm not saying they *succeeded* - just that they put a bit more effort into trying than the person I replied to inferred.
gaming,The internet is so weird. It’s literally impossible to tell if this is meant to make fun of Notch or praise him
gaming,"I had a similar experience with a large game of Munchkin. About 10 players, most of them new-ish (only played at most once before) to the game. Took about 2-3 hours for someone to get close to level 10.

I was closing in on level 10 and one person ahead of me got me killed in my combat. I played Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies ( **Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies**: Play after you lose a combat. Everyone else loses a level. Exception: If you DIED in the combat, so does everyone else. ). Everyone groans and just gives up."

Don't kill my brain trying to make him look like something out of jamunji."
gaming,Shantae.  Bought it several months ago and haven't finished.  Horizon zero Dawn's dlc.  Spiderman 2018s dlc.  Diablo 3 reaper of souls
gaming,"I'm 48,age hasn't affected anything as far as I can tell. My choice in games have changed over the years,might play a bit more strategically than but that comes with experience anyways, other than that I don't feel it's any different.

But then, I've been a semi-pro musician for the past 30 years(started playing guitar/bass between ages 8-10) so that might give me a slight edge in hand/eye coordination over the normal 40+ gamer maybe?"
gaming,That's very toughful of you.
gaming,I highly recommend The Forest if you haven’t tried it
gaming,"A lot of people thought that for some reason...   it was a great game, I really enjoyed it."
gaming,"You can spend 10 million changing the design, delay the film by 6 months, only to have your box-office numbers still go to hell due to the existing negative reception, and the delayed confusing release schedule. At this point it's smarter for them to just cut their losses and get the project out."
gaming,"Kid: “Dad, I want to play a shooting game”

gaming,Its ok when you can skip it
gaming,"Deadpool, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption, I've been addicted to Overwatch, Forza Horizon 4, and Dragonball Xenoverse 2."
gaming,"Its mismanagement. There's lots of reports of how Robert tries to micromanage everything, throws in new ideas all the time and keeps scraping stuff already deep in development.

He has no idea how to manage a big project like this, publisher's pressure was certainly the only reason why his previous games even got released at all."
gaming,"I think a big part of this is game choice too. Going from Odyssey to Sekiro was a trip. In Odyssey, you just look at enemy position and dodge wherever you want to go. 

In Sekiro, you need to see position, attack animations, patterns, timing, etc.

When I went back to Odyssey to get to the DLC, it was a cake walk even though I kept making mistakes with the different button layout."

gaming,"Congrats! With souls I would suggest playing cautiously and taking things slow until you have enough to level up a time or two, then cash in. Don't be scared to Homeward Bone back to a bonfire if you're in a tight spot and don't want to lose souls. When approaching a new area or a boss fight I would recommend you farm some kills until you can level up and get rid of those souls, as you will learn that when you have no souls is the most free you can be in Dark Souls lol. Before doing an exploratory run into unfamiliar territory or attempting to learn a new boss fight I would always try and get rid of my souls so death wasn't such a pain in the butt. 

Anyways, congrats, good luck, and praise the sun! Most of all, have fun"
gaming,So now we know what Sonic looks like after chemo
gaming,Wtf are you talking about? I think you need leave internet for a time.

gaming,"In his mind, look deep in his eyes you can see a glimt of that extraordinary dance."
gaming,Yea there being cut down at an alarming rate
gaming,Not even kidding. The winner of the event got access to special cash store items. People at the top spend tens of thousands on the game like it's nothing.
gaming,"Hell yeah this game was awesome but LISA: The Joyful was kind of hard to play.

The story dropped all comedy and became Nihilistic and the difficulty was insane. Items have a new value to them and I ended up fucking up my save file because I ran out of food"
gaming,"If I buy a midrange GPU and render 60 FPS, then yes, I can buy a high end GPU and render say, 120. But at the end of the day I'm increasing my processing power to render the same thing. The complexity of the process hasn't changed. In this case render times would decrease.

In the real world we keep increasing process complexity, which requires more resources for the same equivalent performance.

Movie studios are increasing scene complexity, which requires more processing power. Give them more processing power, and they'll saturate it with even more complex problems because they can."

gaming,"The only thing that comes to mind was from my CAD/Drafting class in high school.  
The teacher gave everybody the list of assignments on the first day, expecting each one to take roughly a week. Most of the kids in the class finished the entire course of assignments by week 4, and we still had at least a little over 2 months of class.  
We asked him what else he wanted us to do and he said ""just do whatever you want.""  
What we wanted turned out to be loading original Counterstrike on every PC in the room and spending the class playing over the LAN.  
He was fine with this, since we finished the whole term's worth of assignments and were basically just waiting for the term to end.  

One day near the end of the term, the principal walked in while we were playing, and asks the room ""Ummm...What are you all doing?""  
I start explaining to her that we're testing a game that we worked together to make in the class, and we're checking to see if we can find any bugs we need to fix. She seemed skeptical until another kid in the class took my cue and started to narrate the match from a tester's perspective, and he and I basically just played off of each other's bullshit until she left the room satisfied.  
The teacher thanked us for saving his ass, and when the next marking period rolled around, he gave us a smaller list of assignments because ""I owe you one, and you guys already know how to run Autocad."", and we basically spent all but a week or two of that term playing Counterstrike."

gaming,"Honestly even if this game was the greatest game ever made, and actually was released on time, I would never play it because of its massive pay to win structure. I feel bad for OP and others who got suckered in by this format."
gaming,"Worse in other ways though, because folks on set were using a different scale standin to act beside. No actor is looking at the right height or making eye contact with him suddenly. Shots are framed too high to have him in frame. Now the fx studio AND the live action crew are both back on set reshooting things."

gaming,"Heh, funky bootleg Famicom cartridges. I wonder what the actual games inside are. I remember I once found a Famicom ""Yoshi's Island"" cartridge... It was just the OC mario bros."
gaming,Blizzard never shows anything until it is near completion.  This is nothing new.
gaming,If you have any questions at all feel free. Me existing openly is a political statement nowadays so I don’t mind helping someone understand lol
gaming,"3 hours?

We've never taken so long."
gaming,I started talking like Arthur in RDR2 after putting about 100 hours into that game.
gaming,Bring him to me
gaming,"Oh, no. I never wanted to start looking for mirrors! Reality is poison!"
gaming,that must be a really stretchy suit cuz dang
gaming,"I'm sure he will give us his best. That's not necessarily a dig a Carrey. But this script WILL be atrocious, he's a poor fit for the role, and he's already erratic in his personal life in a way Hollywood tends to shy away from. If this had been a GOOD movie it could have relaunched his career."
gaming,"Missed opportunity to write ""L'Otters are not afraid"" as an Easter Egg"
gaming,"What you said is not correct.

I am testing it right now. I played for the last time 1 day and 7 hours ago. That is around 31 hours. But It still says just ""Last seen 1 day ago"""
gaming,Mario and Sonic face off once again to see who can have a worse movie adaptation.
gaming,"Seconded, free to play, lots of grind, tons to do. It’s fun but very confusing for newer players, if you do play I recommend staring/bookmarking the wiki for questions."
gaming,"The Division 2

The depth in that game for a game that hasn't been out 2 months yet is astounding. Ubisoft nailed this game, it's going to have a very good future."
gaming,Found the fortnite fan
gaming,"Reposting other people's OC?

Yeah, I guess so."
gaming,"What you said is not correct.

I am testing it right now. I played for the last time 1 day and 7 hours ago. That is around 31 hours. But It still says just ""Last seen 1 day ago"""
gaming,"Anyone knows how to un-see  something, like forever ?"
gaming,"It was a fairly decent game, but it released the same day as phantom pain so it got overshadowed really bad"
gaming,Start looking into it more and u will see why the game is a awesome tech demo till now and will be the most important game of the next 10 years. The things they achieved till now are crazy and prove that they can archive the goal.
gaming,This sidequest where you save the cows from aliens and watch the sisters have an exsistenal crisis in the face of inevitable death.
gaming,"Civilization V is the better game but its only on PC. If you really want to play on Switch get Civilization 6, which is also pretty good. I was never into these strategy games - in fact I would make fun of my friend for playing them. Then I tried this game out one day and spent 11 hours straight playing it. It makes me wonder about all these people who stick to their Battle Royals and online FPS games, what if they branched out a little to other genres. They're missing out on so many unique experiences. 

But yeah, Civ 5 and 6 are really addictive and enjoyable games."
gaming,I have the base PS4 and the fan is loud enough people can hear it in other parts of the house when I'm playing any games even after taking it apart and clearing out all the dust
gaming,dont play neither but its pretty common sense minecraft can be run on ANYTHING unlike fortnite
gaming,Poor horse! Git gud and shoot the guy next time!
gaming,I did. I played the game. Doesn't mean I am against an easy mode so more people can enjoy the game the way they want.
gaming,"history doesn't repeat itself, but it sure does rhyme"
gaming,"No, it really wasn't. 

When the market was new, pretty much everything was premium purchase or ad supported. It has been progressing this way since a year or two after the App store opened, though. So it's been bad and getting worse for a long while."
gaming,I really don't have the patience for competitive online gaming anymore I find. Leaning more towards co-op that I can play with my RL friends I don't get to see often. Right now a bunch of us are playing The Division 2.
gaming,"Exactly. I don't know why this is odd to some folks.

Back in the 90's it seemed like every Walmart had a rental store right by the doors."
gaming,"Gaming's very own MLM.

Lets see how long until someone posts their referral code..."
gaming,"I was waiting for someone, anyone to bring up ol' Sega Sammy after that trailer dropped. He needs to make a comeback to give us his reaction(s) to this trailer."
gaming,In another few years this whole paragraph is going to sound like nonsense to kids.
gaming,"Oh yeah, I played that game. I don't know what happened to it... I know that one day it just didn't work anymore and it was black."
gaming,"Actually being able to deal with them, generally speaking.  Alien Isolation was a clinic in how to run a horror show (especially for the poor bastards trying it with VR), RPGs aside."
gaming,Most of what I can see in your trash bin is recyclable. Please do not send this to a landfill.
gaming,"Honestly, still sounds like a pretty cool date"
gaming,Basically netflix and chill
gaming,I sleep in a big bed with my wife.
gaming,Literally me anytime I play
gaming,Thank you very much! Really helpful thanks!
gaming,I wanted to like it but I couldn't get over Max's bogan accent.
gaming,Glad to see people shitting on this post
gaming,"Okay, wo would you say the game is fun to play?"
gaming,It was revolutionary at the time. Everyone thought it looked amazing back then.
gaming,Karma train is not going off the rails for you sir
gaming,You can buy single joycons. You've always been able to
gaming,"Umm.. Yeah. Yeah, it’s an Andre 3000 reference. Don’t you worry."
gaming,Case swap your rig into something sff so you can move it from desk to tv with minimal effort and play on the couch when you desire.
gaming,"Sounds a bit negative, so do you think I shouldn't waste money on this game?"
gaming,"Simple. Bad art direction and dumb-asses in charge of major projects.

It's the same reason that Disney is doing [this](https://td-u.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/td-u-the-lion-king-scar-cgi-featured.jpg) for their ""remakes"" instead of [this](https://cdnb.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/009/821/939/large/alex-alvarado-2a14a44a-8a5d-4c37-9d5a-02fe88bfe036.jpg?1521062588).

Bad art director(s) at Square-Enix think that converting [this original concept art](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f8/e6/f0/f8e6f0f0a621424b3c80198e6d5201a0.jpg) and [this old CGI artwork](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/finalfantasy/images/7/75/Barret-ffvii-battle.png/revision/latest?cb=20120415142658) to a ""modern"" era means doing [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/11/06/97/1106974d64b4a9551985d9cc395f0e7f.jpg) or [this](https://s.pacn.ws/1500/rx/final-fantasy-vii-remake-play-arts-kai-no-2-barret-wallace-502889.1.jpg?oi5n6t) to it... instead of the correct thing... which is [THIS goddamn masterpiece](https://cdna.artstation.com/p/assets/images/images/013/165/108/large/hunter-mortenson-screenshot000.jpg?1538382079). And just because it's criminally underviewed... here's a [video of that same character sculpture animated](https://youtu.be/q5cSTJj7mhA)."
gaming,Is it good or bad then?
gaming,"Maybe it’s time we all collectively quit.
5 years and I don’t know how many hours I have given to this childish game."
gaming,My two favorites right now are Siege and Destiny. Destiny is a great looter shooter with tons of hours that you could invest into it and siege is just about as comp as you can get. If you on Xbox at some point hmu and I can show you the games.
gaming,"I don't think he's a poor fit for the role. He's wacky, expressive, over the top without being unbearably hammy, and has proven he can play a good villain/antihero.

If I want sure he just happened to park his RV on set and the director said ""do *not* stop filming him"" I would call it a great choice, probably the only great choice we've seen so far."
gaming,Was it always like that? Mine is coming up on 6 years old later this year and is silent when the fan is on. The loudest thing is the disc drive but I stopped buying discs (I download games) so that isn’t an issue anymore
gaming,Actually I think what Detective Pikachu got right is they kept all the cartoon proportions then just figured out what textures the Pokemon needed. You probably could keep all the Sonic textures if you went back to him having big eyes like in OPs picture.
gaming,"Love It, Live It, BREATH IT"
gaming,"I think you would get better advice from a fallout76 sub. This sub is full of whiny people who complain about every single little thing. And don't appreciate the time, money 💵 effort that go into making games. And then complain when the game makers try to make money or the game has glitches."
gaming,Fantastic! One of our girls is to bring a more fluid site that's easier to navigate. Getting people to what their looking for more quickly without the useless stuff
gaming,And if this guy knew what he was doing he would have put a layer of black down first which is one of the only things an artist can do to keep a water color tattoo from being ruined sooner rather than later.
gaming,"Right? I mean, jeeeezus people. Get real hobbies."
gaming,Ahhhh understandable then. Thanks for the info
gaming,What's the best weapon in the forest?  In your opinion?
gaming,Everybody knows that Smite is the superior moba
gaming,Can a father be proud? You must be fun at parties.
gaming,"What have been seen, can't be un-see"
gaming,That's a funny meme. But no not really.
gaming,Don't forget the barrage of insecure people complaining about something just to get upvotes.
gaming,"I hope will play Gang Beasts this evening, so funny game"
gaming,Understandable I suppose. But with a massive dev team you'd think more than two planets would be done idk
gaming,"Yeah I think they want to give you fun games, you can sink some time in."
gaming,It's been like that ever since about a month after I got the console and it was brand new
gaming,You look like a young Tom Cruise
gaming,"I wanna give it the benefit of the doubt that the initial reactions are overblown just like Will Smith's genie in the Aladdin trailers, but man...this movie's going to need some Oscar-worthy performances and effects to get past whatever that abomination is."
gaming,How did this get platinum?
gaming,Np it’s also been a minute since I’ve played since I beat the main story but it still recommend
gaming,Just think for a second what the implications of posting your underage child on the internet might be. You must be the stupid one at parties.
gaming,What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
gaming,I'm actually surprised how many fan edits look better than the design they went with. Shorter legs? Looks better. Longer legs less torso? Looks better. They somehow managed to screw up every aspect of Sonic's design just enough to make it horrible.
gaming,Golf with your friends is a good time killer when we don’t want to play any competitive games.
gaming,Because thats where you can find the information?
gaming,"WTF is wrong with her face, jesus."
gaming,Board Games Alone  &gt; Drinking Alone
gaming,Put this on r/softwaregore
gaming,I'm surprised they didn't ask for my firstborn
gaming,"Yeah, most movie rental had systems and games you could rent. It was probably $30 for 2 days and 2 games or something."
gaming,"That’s super interesting, now I need to speak with some clan mates to see if theirs is the same. I have initial release in my office, and the destiny taken king PS4 in my living room. I can’t hear either of them. Maybe I got lucky?"
gaming,damn gaming before isn't that a big of a deal back then. We used to play outside and have fun and interact with your neighbors. Now we are surrounded by these gadgets that we don't even go outside anymore
gaming,"Metro exodus ! I haven't had enough time to beat it yet and been enjoying it so much. 

Also kingdom come deliverance is another game I've been having lots of fun with but it's not for everyone"
gaming,Let Mark Wahlberg rest a bit
gaming,How is it selfish when I don’t even know what jungleing is? Selfish would be if I knew and chose not to. You must be another one of those elitists that thinks everyone should know what you know and play how you want.
gaming,"Don't worry, I'm sure someone is coming up with a story right now. Some cute white girl disappearing. Terrorists in our backyard. Video games are turning children into brainwashed super soldiers. Something something religious nonsense. Some political scandal that no one's really surprised about. Drugs are literally the devil, followed by an ad for alcohol. 

You know, the usual."
gaming,I never even heard of this game it looks massive... I'd play Magic: The Gathering again if I could find a place to play where I wont be judged for it...
gaming,"They said dark chocolate, dark chocolate has less sugar than normal chocolates"
gaming,"Hi Everyone! I’m new to Reddit (a friend told me I can get great input here on games). I am contemplating buying The Witcher 3. I never played but I had a blast in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. What are your thoughts on it? 

To contribute to this thread, Octopath Traveler is an incredible Switch game if you haven’t tried it"
gaming,Looks just like the movie
gaming,That is a thing of beauty.
gaming,Like just let him be a cartoon.  Are they trying to convince us hes an actual hedgehog?  Cause they failed that too.
gaming,"That's because there literally hasn't been a better one made since lol. That's just the cold hard truth. There's a reason why there's so many articles and posts about ""I just played Borderlands, what game is like this??"". Spoilers, NOTHING IS. lol."
gaming,"I think this must be from the ""narrative loot"" mod"
gaming,"Both those guys are the exact same person, this is the same dude in two wigs, clearly photoshopped.

/s"
gaming,"When I did it it took less than a month, playing casually, from the start"
gaming,"I've got a decent laptop and fortnite doesn't run that well.

To say you can run it on almost any laptop or computer is wrong."
gaming,$8/week?  This is obviously a predatory ploy to sneak recurring payments in through children who don't know better.  Fuck these people.
gaming,"Ps4 is WAY louder than my 360. It is the loudest console I own, and i own a lot"
gaming,"I mean thats what you want from a loot n shoot right? You can always do stuff, there are so many mechanics, so many frames and weapons to play, to master, achieve rivens for, open world, with an without active bounties, bosses and so on. I got 1000 hours and ye i still dont know some things."
gaming,"Me too, but when trying to make him look ""realistic"" it's basically the most unrealistic part of his face. 

I'm also not saying it should be set in stone that you remove it. 

I think they probably produced hundreds of designs and failed on picking any of the good ones. The eyes are far too small and need to be larger before we even start debating whether or not the uni-eye is necessary. 

I mean, you're trying to make a cute furry animal character, why give him spooky little beady eyes? That's like character design 101."
gaming,Biggest scam in history of video games ...I don’t know how people are still backing up this nonsense
gaming,People who play Fortnite don't deserve rights tbh
gaming,So I saved this post for later to look at the comments and what people thought of it. There was a lot of discussion when I went to bed and now there's nothing here... what happened?
gaming,That looks like movie Sonic :D
gaming,Mount and blade warband or mordheim
gaming,Can someone give me a quick rundown of this game?
gaming,"&gt; It was always like this.

Maybe if you're still a child, then that's true...

Mobile gaming was actually decent at first, then scumbags realized that they can make *shitloads* of money off of children and/or gambling."
gaming,When you got 67 hours to spare.
gaming,I think theres a bundle for old valve games rn. I'd say borderlands 2 but that's just me
gaming,"i agree i've never played a board game, and im 28 and a mega nerd, makes me sad lol, damn small towns"
gaming,"Nobody, op just wants a reason to get his daily dose of circlejerk. Just downvote and move on."
gaming,"I didn’t forget, I have a T-shirt signed by everyone who was modeled for the game. 

Forward, Down, Forward, High Punch"
gaming,literally the only good thing about the trailer.
gaming,"same thing happened to me when trying out Dota 2, got flamed hard lol."
gaming,If they fixed his eyes and made his arms the color of his stomach it would look 5x better.
gaming,"Mine doesn't currently. But the McDonald's inside closed down and the space hasn't been sold yet, so heres hoping"
gaming,He drives no different than actual drivers
gaming,It's not. I just started playing and its fun. People are very friendly
gaming,I personally have been playing alot of dying light. It's an older game but is still pretty fun (and of course multiplayer)
gaming,I'm guessing this would function as more of a gaming cafe then anything else; name is just branding.
gaming,"Treasure no sir, masterpiece yes!"
gaming,"Gang Beasts is fun to play with friends, and goes up to 8 players"
gaming,Friday the 13th can be enjoyable with friends
gaming,"And here I thought *Eldritch Horror* had a lot of fiddly little pieces of deal with, apparently my friends and I are still not into the deep end."
gaming,"If you can get it for less than 30 bicks, then it’s probably worth a shot"
gaming,COD Blackout is a blast with friends.
gaming,"I remember every console’s version of Sorcerer’s Stone being so discouraging as I could never do the sneaking parts well, even as an adult. Gah. I’ve been playing Prisoner of Azkaban on my gameboy and GameCube on repeat for years because the 1-2 sneaking parts are fairly easy. 

Does anyone know if there were sneaking parts on the computer version of the S’S? I was so young I can’t remember much except having to make those patterns for the spells with the mouse. Sorry I’m down a nostalgia hole now 😍"
gaming,Why the heck does this makes sense
gaming,"I actually do want it to fail. Star Citizen community's mentality has already been compared to that of cults. I really don't think a product backed by this kind of unhealthy behaviour should exist.

Heck, look at yours ""I'm sure I'll get labelled as hater"" segment. It speaks to the kind of reaction that your completely fair criticism would get among the SC fanbase."
gaming,Is any of them really good storywise or can i skip them for backlog reasons or are there few which are worth playing?
gaming,"Rainbow six siege is teambased, Rocket league Really fun. both of the games are Competitive."
gaming,Best weapon for me is crafted club with feather upgrades. It swings really fast and it blocks every attack.
gaming,"Whenever a board game looks like it takes an hour to setup, I stay very far away. The rules tend to be way too complicated, and too much to remember"
gaming,Don’t forget to loudly describe the weather at random times.
gaming,Hehe! Be careful I might click on your head too ;)
gaming,"Mechwarrior online.  Not the greatest game,  but best one out right now."
gaming,This is exactly the reason I lost interest in Days Gone. I felt Days Gone started off with a relatable and well paced story and then suddenly it was an open world grind that quickly felt like a chore. Honestly some games handle story pacing with an open world in the missions like Dying Light and Arkham City and it feels less like a chore and you can get back along the narrative with ease.
gaming,I know I really wasn't aiming for the poor horse that's the worst part
gaming,"Which of the 4 ladies did you want to see naked? Or just nude scenes in general, like a sexy naked ghost?"
gaming,Haven’t played Dwarf Fortress but I’ve seen someone else play it. This is not Dwarf Fortress
gaming,Was his backup just some random mallet? Why'd he whip that out and not his sword?
gaming,"How is clean up and storage with scythe? 

I know with gloomhaven they didn't really supply any type of containers or anything to keep all of the little bits in and organized."
gaming,Where pc gaming began for me when I was 4
gaming,"MechWarrior Online still has plenty of players, and it's free."
gaming,I mean for honour is fun...depends really on what ya tastes are a bit more info would help.
gaming,"Of the myriad games that use the whole press Y to counter thing, MM was the only one that nailed it. Made every fight into an enjoyable movie like satisfying encounter. Sleeping Dogs was cool too."
gaming,"A free browser game everyone can play is called krunker.io. We all play it in uni and it’s pretty funny. There’s no proper way to match with friends so you have to go on server browser, find a server with room like 0/8 and state the server name so everyone can find it and join. I’d recommend going on custom games and selecting infect mode (infect will be in the server title) as that’s the best one"
gaming,They don’t deserve the glory of defeating those bosses if they need easy mode.
gaming,Why? You're the very first person I've ever heard say they didn't like that game.
gaming,Could this be why we're suddenly getting huge amounts of messages from random bot accounts on xbox?
gaming,"Yeah honestly that’s how I did it, just go fast and try to be accurate with your jumps, honestly I kept falling off of the ropes and couldn’t stay on any hahah"
gaming,I never disagreed with that.
gaming,"How do they get the 400 dollar? On the steam site it says that the headset only is 539 euro and the headset+ controllers+ base stations is 1079 euro (1 dollar =  0.889  according to google)

Edit: I misread the title i confused the oculus with the valve"
gaming,"I remember playing this game when I was 11-12, didn't have a memory card, so I replayed the first bit over and over.  You would think, by the time I got a memory card I would have known what the sphere grid was, I ended up quitting at Sin Spawn until a few months later my friend was confused on how I couldn't kill him, I told him I was grinding so many levels, and it didn't make a difference.  He then asked how far I was on the sphere grid, confused, I asked what he was talking about, he explained.  I got home, and was then overpowered for the next half of the game.  I miss the times of middle School, PC gaming, and the thrill of getting home for the weekend with a brand new game to play.  The feeling I had playing my first MMO (Guild Wars), with new expansions, will never be recreated.. and it hurts knowing that."
gaming,"Heroes always protect people from harm, even if those people don’t know it. Have a wonderful day, sir."
gaming,the white people that want to build a wall need to see these latinas
gaming,Can we please stop making these women famous when they put literally zero effort into cosplaying?
gaming,"I'm 48...been gaming since Pong. The two main things I've noticed over the past couple years are:

1. My tolerance for bullshit (poor level/game design, grinding, etc.) is at an all-time low. If a game annoys me, I'll bail on it rather quickly...because, realistically, my time is more valuable and there are a plethora of other options.
2. My hands and fingers will cramp up playing old school SHUMPS specifically. Gotta take ""pause"" breaks every 15-20 minutes or so."
gaming,"Interesting, Might pick it up in the future when the price drops."
gaming,&gt;I am the Swarm
gaming,"Not taking any sides but you could most likely vow for FN having more hours played.

I know a lot of people playing both and unlike FN, a good amount of MC players do it on a semi regular basis.

Though the MC players actually enjoy their time 😊"
gaming,"Pressing Y now, sir"
gaming,I was surprised my parent POS Gateway could run it.
gaming,11 year old you would go straight edge out of spite after seeing this.
gaming,"I’m actually laughably bad at rainbow six lol but I’ll check out rocket league, thanks"
gaming,No problem :). Not trying to be a dick but alloud and could of are some of my pet peeves
gaming,seek emulator for old mechwarrior games
gaming,No console is THAT loud that you literally can't hear your TV. Maybe loud enough to hear the fan come on and maybe annoy you slightly if you're going out of your way to listen for it but it's not like you've actually got a helicopter in your living room. I've got the base PS4 and it's never gotten so loud that I notice it when I'm focused on a game.
gaming,You're completely missing the point I was making.
gaming,"I still believe also...  such a shame that it was rushed out, the Mario Galxy came out the next year..  poor bastard didn't stand a chance."
gaming,Pick up a temporary job like being a waiter or something until you can find a new better job. It’s not that hard to find one. I would know because I’ve done it.
gaming,I actually remember that game. Didn’t a new dlc come out for it like a year ago?
gaming,"I remember Gateway PC's being the bomb, #CowBoxes"
gaming,What did I just see
gaming,"I totally forgot about MechWarrior Online, geez. I'll definitely be playing it and hope there are other mech games available."
gaming,"Not a child, but only got a smartphone fairly late in life. However,  i remember hearing this kind of criticism about mobile games as far as 2011 or so."
gaming,"If people get angry at each other for playing a competitive game, and taking things over the top, maybe they aren't fit for that type of game. I know its frustrating at times, but having cool-headed comms with friends while playing together and enjoying the game is not an impossible thing. The more you play with each other the less you would get into those frustrating situations."
gaming,"No, no he didn't"
gaming,The tittle should say rest *
gaming,"Writing a realistic, healthy, relationship is way.. *way* harder than writing a girl who becomes enamored and sleeps with you one night"
gaming,"wtf, I haven't played a game in under an hour and 30...ever...With setup, it normally gets to 2 hours, even with friends who've played multiple times. My longest game was 6 hours because we were teaching a nooby."
gaming,"I honestly don't remember, I got it a few days ago and have been having a blast.

Edit: Looked it up and a big dlc released in 2016"
gaming,It's almost like people upvote what they want to!
gaming,Check out BatteTech if you like tactics and squad management games.
gaming,This makes my pp hard
gaming,"Yeah I got it yesterday. There is 56gig update if you get physical copy. I bought mine used for 10euro. There are still people, you will notice Early on there are glitchy things and technicality's on a regular basis. Mostly redundant. The people are very friendly and there are plenty npc's as robot and allot of ingame exploration; noted, maps ect. 

It feels allot like fallout 4 and is pretty decent. There is also a cool Miami mod you can check out, if you are looking for a more immersive structured story experiance. Immersion is surtenly in fa76 and there are allot of mission (lvl10 now)

Also in November there will be private servers with mods."
gaming,"Here's the thing: I'm going to act like you're dead serious just so I can talk about how lame even his damn shows are.

All the design possibilities in the world, even different branding and licensing opportunities... And THOSE were the best you could come up with? You're telling me something like the Sonic equivalent of [these $900 Dolce &amp; Gabbana Shadow the Hedgehog shoes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DglsJw1U0AEuvs2?format=jpg&amp;name=medium) or even the actually really, really real [Nike Ultra XTs](https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/248/9086/10h/origin-d5.scene7.com/is/image/sneakerhead/snusa-detail_20_zoom?$2356$&amp;$img=sneakerhead/nike-ultra-xt-819671600-5) which look like they were made to look like Sonic's shoes wouldn't work??

The same goes for the gloves. Some cool [freerunning gloves](https://thebestparkourgear.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Seibertron-Mens-Black-300x241.jpg) or something akin to those albeit with the fingers covered? Nah, just give him exposed hands that *happen* to be whitish and also make his stomach fur match the whitish color of his hands so that his mouth can be an entirely different color."
gaming,I proudly do not own an ironing board
gaming,I’ll edit it to have a bit more info. Just interested in what other people enjoy aswell really :)
gaming,ye same i have 0.5 kd i am just pain in the ass for my friends
gaming,Equally unpopular opinion: it's the worst Arkham game (including Origins).
gaming,"Sadly, you are wrong"
gaming,"I've played and 100% completed every AC game since the beginning up to Origins. I'm love the history and story but I'm pretty sick of how long it takes to play the games. I feel like I have to play the games for a year to beat it. It gets old opening chests, collecting flags, and animus glitches.

I wish AC games were more like Tomb Raider style."
gaming,"Yeah, I really enjoyed fallout. Let’s hope they update the engine and gameplay for fallout 5!"
gaming,Thanks I can help a bit more (I'm a PlayStation geek...-_-)
gaming, Do you have the 2nd part on page A7?
gaming,"Unfortunately nothing comes close.  I've had the same itch for some time now.  And i like mechwarrior and all,  but the game gets old after awhile. Can't seem to find anything else worth playing."
gaming,"That was my original point. You were the one who said Epic games is making people buy into their cosmetics micro transactions and they’re not. It’s the people buying them that are the problem, not Epic."
gaming,He’s actually better than I am.
gaming,"portal 2 if teamwork is number 1 goal,  path of exile if you want a casual game to play while you bullshit (it's also free) and farcry 5 if you just want some pew pew."
gaming,He’s twice as good as me.  I’m rubbish.
gaming,"Yea and this is where accurate language is important. Is it 6 seconds per frame for a single machine, is it 6 hours per frame for the entire render farm. There's a massive difference between the two and using that language for the first case is extremely misleading IMO."
gaming,One of the few PC games in the last few years that I played to completion.  I enjoyed the ride (drive) and the setting was great.  Good game from every angle.
gaming,I use to play this and the Rugrats game as a kid. Thanks for taking me back!
gaming,Watch out. Its Squantchy
gaming,"Love how You refer to Yourself as a mega nerd haha.

gaming,"Unfortunately for some gamers on here the only games they play are ones advertised on billboards and online ads. Outside of that they can't comprehend the existence of fun/quality games. We call them the ""basic gamers""."
gaming,Well some stores do that. Like Lowe's. They're all identical.
gaming,Can you upgrade your system to have them?
gaming,"I can’t be the one to do that for you, you’ll have to wait for a worse man than I to come along and tell you, sorry."
gaming,"They should cut sonic from the movie, and just show Jim Carrey being eggman for 90 minutes."

gaming,Nintendo movies sucked too
gaming,"overall it's a good game. i'm just a fan of the old ghost recon games and it's not a very good ghost recon game. If you enjoy ubisoft open world games like assassins creed or far cry and like shooters then you are more likely than not to enjoy playing it. more so if you have some friends to play it with.

also regarding the story: it's extremely weak, mostly because the ghosts are never the actual protagonists of the story, the NPCs are, so there is no reason for you to care. but again, if you play with friends, the story will be secondary and doing cool stuff like stealing a plane and paradropping into the middle of a base and gunning everyone down or sneaking into a base with a buddy on overwatch with a sniper keeping your back clear."
gaming,Pre show is in few min game pl play reveal is in half hour
gaming,"The new mc 1.14 update has a ton of great new game improvements, chief among them the village/villager changes! u/create1ders made a [great graphic](https://i.redd.it/7gjfbk7ci1v21.jpg) summarize them!"

Plenty of times I have tried a game and liked it despite the reviews.

You know what you like, don't let others tell you. :)"
gaming,"That and mount and blade are both installed on my xbone even though I haven’t touched them in over a year. I really wish mount and blade would have been multiplayer, and I wish Chiv had more than ten people on at a time otherwise I’d still be playing them regularly."

gaming,"The original is a classic, scary in parts and goofy in others, it’s one of my favourite especially since I’m not a fan of scary movies it is nicely on the line of scary, goofy, funny, and in parts kinda touching"
gaming,"Because small dot-like eyes are what hedgehogs actually have, so it fits. Unlike, say, two rows of molars."

gaming,No one gonna mention that 9gag watermark...
gaming,Wait for private servers and mods. Then moders will fix the game and make it enjoyable because that's always what happens with Bethesda games.
gaming,"Yeah, mine has a Rally's and Auntie Anne's in the front."
gaming,Pre-show is starting at 9:30AM PT and the actual gameplay reveal starts at 10:00AM PT.
gaming,"Crikey, that's a thicc boy."
gaming,"Ark, the survival game with dinosaurs kind of reminds me of Minecraft and No Man’s Sky.  It looks fun, but I haven’t gotten to try it."
gaming,"I agree, I used to love them, but now... the only one I truly enjoyed is GTA5"
gaming,"I would be. It just wouldn't look right. Now if the whole movie was animated (CG or traditional), then fine. But a cartoon character in a real world is just jarring. You need to pick a style, otherwise they clash. Unfortunately they seemed to have picked horrifyingly ""realistic-ish"" as their style."
gaming,Rise of the robots on Panasonic 3do
gaming,"The graphics during the sandstorms, and the fact that was a real ""front"" headed your way was gorgeous. The driving wasn't bad either. I did get a bit bored with the fighting, I wish weapons were permanent to give more variety perhaps."
gaming,"yo, moron, please point out where did i ever say that the movie sonic design was good! and please hold your breath until you write those words"
gaming,"Yeah, Dying light got it absolutely right! Even the DLC was incredible!

As for the Batman games..... the riddler missions are the absolute worst, especially in Arkham knight.  But other than  amazing games!"
gaming,I even read that in dunkey's voice.
gaming,Lol just thru it at the recycle bin at work. Sorry...
gaming,"A slightly more complete explanation: His original japanese name is Dr. Eggman, but western versions renamed him Dr. Robotnik. In Sonic Adventure (1998) they tried to unify both names by havin sonic call him eggman while still referring to him as robotnik.

From Sonic Adventure 2 onwards, the Robotnik named was dropped and all versions called him Eggman. The official explanation by Sega of America, backed up by Sonic's creator Yuji Naka, is that his birth name is Ivo Robotnik, and Eggman is just his supervillain nmae. However, that doesn't hold true for the japanese canon which never called him robotnik ever. However, in Sonic Adventure 2, his grandfather is named as Dr. Gerald Robotnik, even in the japanese version, implying Robotnik is the real family name.

Some will say his name was originally Kintobor, but that's something added to early tie-in media like comics and books, and has never been backed by the games"
gaming,I feel there should be a subreddit for mobile games that don’t do this. The rare ones that still operate like they used to. It would make finding them a lot easier.
gaming,That's an awesome skin! What is it??
gaming,Maybe that’s what’s gonna happen in the sonic film...
gaming,Have you watched it? It's reaction time and decision making is near instant
gaming,Same for me. Also Tonka Racing
gaming,"Ang Lee's version, with Eric Bana?"
gaming,"Canada, i call myself a mega nerd cause i love star wars, star trek, World of warcraft, all that stuff lol"
gaming,And still a sneaky stealth archer I wager?
gaming,I bet his contact lenses must hate him
gaming,Yes but this is a 'live action' film so you'd think he would actually look like a hedgehog for once. IMO he looks nothing like a hedgehog in the games or in this film lol.
gaming,"I still need sauce tho, despite the comments"
gaming,"Warframe is always my go to recommendation.

Free to play (and I mean *actually free*, everything in the game can be gotten by playing, incuding the premium currency by trading with other players.)

No pay to win, nothing you can spend real money on will give you any kind of advantage over anyone else.

Tons of content. The game already has a metric fuckton of stuff to do and it's constantly getting more.

Edit: pain meds were making me type like Hellen Keller."
gaming,That's a fun word to try and say out loud.
gaming,"I have an XBONE S and I absolutely adore it, all my media consumption happens through it like Netflix, Prime, Stan, YouTube, Blu-ray 4K discs and Spotify etc.

I grew up with a PS2 and wanted to have a PS4 but it was a bit out of budget maybe one day I'll be able to play PS exclusives but for now I enjoy my Halo, Forza Horizon and Sea of thieves."
gaming,A truly incandescent post
gaming,"A friend of mine worked on a film with a cgi robot main character. He overheard the director ask the VFX consultant how much it would be to add a shot of the robot touching a chair and testing its weight before he sits down. The robot was already walking up to the chair and sitting down. This is just for the patting.

""hmmmm.... about $38,000.""

That was for an existing model to just be animated for a few seconds. They would have to remake the model and reanimate the entire movie. You're talking about tens of millions."
gaming,"colony wars iirc is psygnosis, that was an amazing game and series."
gaming,"some interesting choices for skill point distro, speaking of points now you need to legendary them to get all the skill points in every one. that's the true ocd. 

Depending on how badly you a abused the alchemy/enchanting thing and if you're using any mods that could take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours."
gaming,Where can I get this?!?!?!
gaming,Same soup just reheated
gaming,It's a shame. The more options we have the better &amp; it's not much to implement.
gaming,I am guilty of both of these
gaming,For reals! You know this guy just pounds whiskey and smokes like a chimney.  That Sonic has a darkness in him.
gaming,That one on the bottom left is thicc
gaming,So that's what Dunkey drives.
gaming,"""Its like 200 points"" XD
Looks cool, hope it was fun to make!"
gaming,He obviously lost his plat promos.
gaming,Finally someone acknowledges it was the OP zombie and that damn creeper
gaming,Also have the 700 for my ps. There's a TINY reset switch on the USB stick. Needs to be picked with a paperclip or something similar.
gaming,Those are names I haven’t heard in a while
gaming,"Fortnite is a very easy game to run, that's one of the things going for it against other battle royale games actually: the very simple cartoon style of the game does not take very complicated assets, I'm sure a shitty laptop with a 960M and 6Gb of RAM can run it decently.

Minecraft on the other hand, it eats RAM like chrome, and while vanilla runs well, the whole point of this game is either Redstone or mods (there's only so much you can do with the default content even for building), and either of those two will start making the game run poorly.

Out of the two, minecraft is probably the hardest to run when used at it's maximum potential. So no excuses there."
gaming,"Yeah that’s so awesome lol, I’d have to say I’m the same kinda nerdy but with different things haha. 
&amp; That’s cool, what’s Canada like? I’m from Australia."
gaming,What really show me
gaming,maybe ask a coworker? :)
gaming,Moms who will let their kids sit in a gaming cafe for 30 minutes instead of them being annoying while shopping. Same reason there were always arcades at malls.
gaming,Definitely a fun play.  Slightly repetitive but no worse than Assassin's Creed or Shadow's of Mordor
gaming,Minecraft with shaders lol
gaming,Thank you kindly! Just got my psv 2000 import yesterday. Got a 32gb memory card coming today. Can't wait to get it all my games on it!
gaming,"Yeah, and it’s the only one that makes traveling fun! I can’t wait for GTA 6!"
gaming,Uh I updated and can still play Alcatraz. They even changed a few things on the map.
gaming,"Actually, even if it makes sense I can totally un-see it. I look back at the top panel and I still see the two big eyes."
gaming,"55 and still going strong. I'd have to say my biggest issue is my eyesight. I don't use glasses when playing but perhaps I should as I know my eyesight isn't what it used to be and sometimes I have a hard time seeing stuff. I'm also colorblind but that hasn't really been an issue that often I don't believe. I've tried using the colorblind modes in games and never really noticed any difference so not really sure it's that big of a hinderance. 

I really don't think my motor skills have declined that much but I never was much of a competitive player anyway so if I was a top player I might have noticed a bigger difference with age.

I would echo what someone else said earlier which is that my tolerance for childish stuff is at an all time high. I don't get angry I just leave. Get off my lawn you kids!!!!"
gaming,"I get what you mean and agree, although i still feel as though there's a limit to how much unnecessary shit someone can take."

gaming,You can also leave the community if you think it's so terrible
gaming,Borderlands 1 (GOTY Remastered).
gaming,AC Odyssey is a good one

gaming,"I PUT YOU INTO THIS WORLD, and well you know the rest"
gaming,This is one of those things that’s either gonna surprise everyone or start a riot.
gaming,This is the point where you go browsing rings buddy
gaming,Don’t get gamepass because it’s not worth it. You have backwards compatibility so that more than makes up for it.
gaming,I know! It still feels weird. But I think dirt is still the same...
gaming,The whining in this sub whenever there’s some cosplay chick is unbelievable. It took you more time getting your panties all twisted and posting a comment than it would’ve taken you to just downvote and keep scrolling. If someone could somehow harvest the energy generated by angry neckbeards on the internet we’d finally find that perfect renewable clean energy.
gaming,That sounds awesome! Congrats

gaming,"Ah Scythe

So much fun."
gaming,"Dinosaur egg! Really rare drop rate, that's awesome Op"
gaming,"Changed ""chew"" to ""eat"" cause that makes more sense. This post is garbage for lonely 16 year old social outcasts to upvote"
gaming,"No I got your point loud and clear. Why do you think gangs come out with remastered versions? Because our standards have increased, and the older versions look shitty.

Take for example Sega game gear. When i played that as a kid it looked incredible, well i still own it and let my 5 year old play sonic. And he asked why it looked like that and was it broken. Nope not broken just cant compare to an iPad he was used to."
gaming,Still looks better than movie sonic
gaming,"If you dont mind older games then Saints Row 2 in co op is brilliant, Divinity Original Sin 1 and 2 are also up there in terms of brilliantness, Resident evil 5 and 6 are fun co op games (maybe not the best resident evil games but my friend and I sure had fun.) 7 days to die is scary fun with friends, Ashen is pretty good also, Saints Row 3, Dark souls 3 is fun with a friend, Dead Rising 2 is also a blast, Far Cry 5 is funny as hell if you dont take it seriously, My friend and I played through all the Gears of War games (Avoid 4 its was awful compared to the three we ad just played.) , Payday 2, Diablo 3, Path of Exile, Any of the Borderlands games. 

Sorry if that was a bit long."
gaming,My guess is that he has a nictitating membrane.

gaming,It also didn’t help being released the same day as MGS V
gaming,Mine has an arena where heavyweights battle it out for Bigmacs and chicken nuggets

It just gave me a bad vibe of this sub crossing a weird threshold."

gaming,"I can't speak for anyone except myself but I handed Chris Roberts my money because I was one of those people who loved Wing Commander and Freelancer back in the day. I'm also sick and tired of these 'AAA' studios just pushing out minimal effort 'Live Services' crap year after year just because their publisher/investor wants a quick buck. :P

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, Star Citizen may fail but that's always a risk. At least CIG and a few other development studios are taking a chance at trying to push the gaming industry forward instead of the current complacent 'AAA industry' where investors are forcing safe minimal effort stuff out the door before they are even finished just to hit a quarter on a spreadsheet with a ""We'll fix it later...maybe"" policy just to get a quick return on their investment. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that's just me... ;)"

gaming,Had to upvote for the sarcastic response.

gaming,The guy on the cover looks like Kronk
gaming,How is it for roms / emulators ? I had a PSP that I lost a good while back and I really miss just playing old NES/SNES etc roms on it whenever I was out on a trip.

gaming,He looks so much more friendly now
gaming,"My guess is lots of people you know like board games, but they associate ""board games"" with the garbage they grew up with instead of the vibrant industry that exists today. My group of board game friend started small, but gradually grew to encompass everyone because there is absolutely, without a doubt, at least a couple games out there that each person will enjoy. There are so many different kinds of games that the uninitiated have no idea about. Organize a Board Games and Booze night for some friends. Lure them in with the booze and hook them with the games. Settlers of Catan is a great gateway game."
gaming,"Vampyr.. Just started playing last night.. So far it looks like a pretty decent game. Atmospheric, dark and it's drawing you in. 
Only downside is that the combat is a bit clunky - maby it's because i just finished Sekiro shadow die twice, that game have a awesome combat system.."
gaming,"I’m a fan of Borderlands, but it’s gameplay is exactly like the other 3. What would be the difference?"

gaming,"I work in IT for a major university and was tasked with setting up Hololens for use in the medical school

I didnt get to play minecraft, but everything I have seen demonstrated in their Ted Talks and advertisements is 100% how that thing operates.

Literally mind blowing.

Now the med students are doing full anatomy and dissection courses with holograms"
gaming,"Yes! Great idea, thanks for the idea!! &amp; I love Catan, one of my favourite games."
gaming,"Dno, I kinda liked the trailer but in the same way I like grade Z horror movies from the 80s"
gaming,"As someone who set them up and deployed them for the medical department of his university, this is simply not true. The FOV was more than practical and accommodating for medical applications like working on cadavers

gaming,"My guesses are: there’s a first time player that needs rules explained as they go, they’re taking turns individually, people are paying too much attention to other players turns and not thinking of their next move, and if you combine all those into a five player game it’ll take a while. I find Scythe is better 2-3 player game just so the action keeps going for people playing."

gaming,"I used to drive past a Wal Mart every day on the way home from work. Whatever I needed, I could run in and get it, which is great since I never plan ahead and just cook for supper whatever I am in the mood for that night. Wal Mart has far better meat than Kroger does, especially steak, so it was great.

Now I work in a different place and the only grocery store I drive by is one of Kroger's affiliate stores called JayC which is like the Dollar General store of grocery stores. They specialize in never having the one thing you need the most."
gaming,"Yeah, there’s tons of games coming out with sonic in them, and a popular TV show.

Example, I'm latino (Cuban) yet I would literally burst into flames (insert loud whooshing sound here) if I stepped out onto the midday Miami sun, that's how pale I am.

Remember: Race (edit: to clarify, I mean racial traits by this) comes from genetics, Ethnicity comes from culture."

gaming,Still looks better than the movie
gaming,"That's not what I said... As my comment stated, the design houses are indeed usually in the US. But it's very possible that the actual creation of the 3D model and the animations are indeed outsourced.

I'm a 3D modeler from Argentina and I know of several schoolmates of mine that did modeling work for hero assets in AAA games. They are designed in the US but the concepts and schematics are then send to an outsourcing studio to produce the assets. It's very common for games and films."
gaming,"I’m 43 and I find that I’m a lot more patient. I don’t get frustrated as easily. And while my hand/eye coordination isn’t the same as it used to be, I do very well. When I was younger I’d rush through things...and inevitably miss things...so I slow down more now (goes back to patience)."

gaming,"I was surprised how well the game was able to capture the feel of the car chases, especially in first person. As much as this gets over used, I really felt like I was in a mad max movie chase."
gaming,"Actually sea of thieves just got a big update, there are grappling hooks on harpoon launcher things at the front of the ships so boarding a ship and doing sharp turns is now possible, and you can fish. This update makes everything before it seem like an early access technology demo. I feel sorry for anyone who put significant time into the game before this update. And I'd even recommend holding off another year for the arena modes to be fleshed out and more cool stuff to be added, it'll be the ultimate pirate game. But right now is a good time to start playing too."

gaming,"Wal mart was trying to get into the PC game, they had a halfass built higher end PC in their stores. This could have been a good deal to further that idea."
gaming,"Solutions to this problem:

1.	Claim the movie was actually based on Sanic the dead meme, which explains the horrible design and even the blue arms, and probably even the terrible script and production values
2.	Make the bad design part of the plot. Say Eggman shot Sonic with a human ray and made him part human, or have the plot be that he fused with a human kid and they have to learn to work together in the same body to fight Eggman and return to normal (mix between ""kid gets superpowers"" and ""Sonic in human world"" plots).
3.	Fucking cancel this and redo ALL of the CGI, including adding more chub onto Eggman

Or just release it, let it bomb, and leave a scar on a beloved franchise like Ghostbusters 2016"

Post that issue at the steam forum, they can help you with it."
gaming,"Yea I used to use detail view above the others but then realized it helps to see the cover of a game to keep appeal for it. I have so many games and giving it a face gives it more value in a sense so I started using the grid view. Detailed view made the games just a list and just words in a way. Thats just me obviously but yea, thats why it bothers me so much lol. Plus my OCD for having all 7 games I have installed all on one line looool."

The locked 60fps (as in actual ingame 60fps, not just displayrate 60fps like N64 [and many consoles] did but 30 variable [usually sub-30fps with Goldeneye on N64]) is new as well.  This is basically like a PC port that allows proper 60fps and M&amp;K support."
gaming,"F76 isn't nearly as bad as all the hype.  It has tons of issues, or at least did when I last played it at a couple months ago(not a testament to the game, I just dont have time for games like that).  But there's still plenty to like.  Anthem?  Haven't tried it, but apparently it's already mostly dead, so why bother?"

gaming,"Well I'll start off with saying I don't want you to get me wrong, I really do hope the game comes out to be an incredible work of art.  But nothing I have seen has made me stop and think, ""Wow, this game that was supposed to release four years ago is blowing my mind.""  A lot of what I've seen (admittedly I stopped really keeping up with it a while ago, but still follow the big points) just seems to be stuff that's tacked on for the sake of showing how great it is.

A perfect example of this is (and this was one of the early points of the game) something like the ships being 100% physics simulated, with each thruster point being simulated and things like the fuel lines in the ship being 'real'.  I think that's super cool, but when it comes down to it, they could just fake all that with much simpler systems and you would never know.  There comes a point in the development of games, especially a crowd funded game, where you have to weigh the benefits of spending years developing systems that people wouldn't really notice to begin with."
gaming,"Just finished up crackdown 3, suprisingly found myself having alot of genuine fun."

gaming,"The real reason I play switch is to play Skyrim at school, besides that I don’t play it much"
gaming,"Thanks, I hate it

Sonic without his “goggles” terrifies me."
gaming,"Because Epic is creating 3rd party exclusives. Steam doesn't.

&gt;1st party exclusive VS 3rd party exclusive

&gt;The only titles truly exclusive on Steam are Valve games (1st party), for obvious reasons (unless you buy a CD of one of their older titles). This is similar to how the only exclusives on Origin are EA titles.

&gt;No one cares if the company that owns the IP wants to hold their IP on their own platform.

&gt;Other developers/publishers that release on Steam have always been free to distribute their game elsewhere, which is why some of them show up on GOG or whatever. The fact that most do not choose to sell outside of Steam is on those specific publishers/developers and customers should take it up with them, as to why they are removing customer freedom.

&gt;The issue with EGS is that they are seeking deals with 3rd party developers/publishers that they don't own or have any stake in. Epic is restricting customer choice. Sure, it's timed but the fact remains. People are worried that this will become common practice in this industry if they are successful, which leads to a whole lot more issues including increased ""piracy"".

&gt;Note that everyone is generally okay with Division 2, because that was released on UPlay as well."

gaming,"People like to point the finger at Nike, but I'd honestly bet that the execs saw that this beloved character was in games that were loathed and tanking so they thought mixing it up would bring back the numbers. The problem is there was never an issue with Sonic himself, and just the ""vehicle"" he was put in was lackluster.

gaming,Epic takes only 12% from sales. Steam 30%-25%-20% depending on sales.
gaming,The spider finished him off though..
gaming,Except Spongebob doesn’t actually have human skin or ears like that. So no.

gaming,"ok i never seen the spongebob one, but im almost 100% certain its gonna hunt me in my dreams at some point...thanks...i guess..."
gaming,"Those are both good. Bloodborne is a gothic horror based action RPG akin to Dark Souls, while Persona 5 is an amazing JRPG with a deep story and turn based combat.

Witcher 3 is also great if you haven't tried that either. It's a huge open world RPG with meaningful dialogue choices and skill trees. Highly recommend that one as well"
gaming,"There is no such thing as a game that is only on steam: You can buy a physical copy, buy a game key on a plethora of websites, etc etc.

The epic store is exclusive. You can only buy those games through the epic store and nowhere else. You can't buy a physical copy and add it to the launcher with a cd key. You can't buy a digital copy and activate it on the launcher using the key. You must buy it ONLY through their store, by inputting your payment information on their software, and agreeing to their questionable terms of service."
gaming,"I'll do my best to break down all of the hate into a few easy points:

1. PC gaming has NEVER had 3rd party exclusives. 1st party exclusives make sense - why would EA sell Battlefield on Steam, or Valve sell Half Life on Uplay? Epic is BRIBING publishers (often against the will of the developers) into 3rd party exclusives.

2a. Epic Launcher skims data it shouldn't be looking at, and no one knows what they do with it. A huge chunk of their funding is now coming from TenCent, a Chinese company that is known for shitty practices. China is also known for some bad shit, technology wise, so this adds up to a lot of questions, a lot of scary guesses, and no answers.

2b. Epic Launcher has barely any core features we have come to expect from game launchers on PC, and many people refuse to use something so sub par.

3. Epic recently shelved many good 1st titles of theirs to fuel the Fortnite fire. People are justifiably pissed that some of the titles they looked forward to were killed just to keep a crappy kids game going.

4. Fortnite sucks."
gaming,Show me this answer on google. Cuz I cannot find it.
gaming,"There has been controversies over the placement of ""penises"" in Disney movies for almost as long as there have been Disney movies.  I suspect that this is a refernce to that but tries to give the in univers explanation that yes, Mickey has Penis Fingers."

gaming,"The headline is dumb but the actual idea some of the people who get into streaming platforms might not be new to gaming entirely and will jump ship from existing setups such as PCs or consoles is entirely reasonable.

If you find this personally offensive maybe don't define your personality by which box you play games on."
gaming,"Her whole circle of friends are similar. They were just very outgoing girls growing up and literally paid no attention to video games. The only games she likes are the Wii Mario Party games or Mario Kart Wii. Games without motion controls are too hard because she never developed the muscle memory to use a controller.

Knowing who Sonic is for her is about the same as knowing who the quarterback for the Patriots is by memory (If you know nothing about sports; I know I don't know that by memory). People would express the same amazement you just did."

That's like saying nolan north has no business in uncharted.

Charles Martinez has no business being in Mario.

Mark Hamill has no business being in batman."
gaming,Nobody gives a fuck
gaming,Because of the partnership they have selling their PC's. Which are just shit PCs cheaply made and over priced.
gaming,"Sonic, having goggles, would run into the issue that he would have stuff smash into them continuously.

He’d have to have a system, like F-1 pilots have, so that he could peel off a layer.

Also, it’d probably be a good idea to keep his mouth shut..."

gaming,more like someone had yasuo on their team
gaming,The point is if you start with shit no matter how much you polish it its' still a turd. If they would have put just a little more effort in capturing Sonic's look they wouldn't be in this position.
gaming,"Still, i didnt make the title to the video"
gaming,"Only for 6 months. If it was exclusive for ever, then I think things would be much worse."

gaming,It’s there. I’ve had my arm cut off. I figured it out after my character lost his weapon and was only holding up one hand and screaming.
gaming,"What’s your budget?

Hyperx cloud 2 is a great set of cans and a pretty good mic. Good all-round and can’t go wrong. 

Sennheiser Game One is one of my favourites and so comfortable. Great sound and mic! Detachable cable. 

Arctis Pro + Gamedac is pricey but the best sound out of all my sets. 

Arctis 7 if you want wireless. Sound not as good as the arctis pro, but still pretty good and wireless."
gaming,There are some proper drawing apps if you have cfw.

gaming,"I understand heat dissipation just fine, but my comment was more about air flow and direction than about heat dissipation. I realize that just because I'm liquid cooling, the amount of heat being generated by my CPU doesn't change, but what does change is the way I'm dealing with that heat. With a massive heatsink + 140mm fan, it was always just pushing all of that hot air directly out of the back and top of the case.  With liquid, the heat is transferred to the front radiator where it is dissipated. The difference is the heat is dissipated at the front of the case, where the intake fans pull cool air over the radiator. The warm air coming off the radiator, for the most part is now exhausting out of the top of the case instead of the back. 

With my graphics card, prior to liquid it had 3 fans that would push hot air directly down towards the bottom of the case, which would pretty much end up just rising upwards, and being split between exhausting out of the top/back. After installing a 140mm rear mounted radiator for it, almost all the warm air dissipating from it goes out of the back now. 

My point was that if he went liquid cooling, he could be possibly be transferring the heat to a top mounted rad and exhausting out of the top of the case where there is a lot more room for the warm air to dissipate once it leaves the case."
gaming,Basically it's the company that created some nasty zombie viruses. That's why a lot of people here are advising to stay away from this thing.
gaming,"Yes. I have it on n64(with the expansion pack), where the buildings and units are 3d models.
I also plan on getting the freeware release and the fan upgrade.
I have a PS3 so I could also get it on that.
I still love the classic game. It's timeless."

gaming,This is what happens when you have free health care.
gaming,How does this compare to Chivalry? Looks exactly like it. Id like to avoid spending countless hours fighting lag/glitch swingers that do stupid unrealistic crap. Bend backwards 100% with an over the head forward slash that cant be guarded against for example. Or the padded armor dagger spammer who kills a full plate guy because you cant get a swing off. Chiv was awesome until all those turds took over :(
gaming,"Eh, supposedly a mini version is due this year, and an upgraded version is due next year. I love my switch, but if you’re not truly sure I’d wait. Hell, you might realize you don’t want one and save yourself some money"
gaming,"It had so many good elements, but it is let down by dumb design decisions that made it less than its parts.

Why is there *no loot* other than generic junk resource?   
Why, in a game that's all about driving a car, are nearly all upgrades locked behind story missions and clearing areas, rather than findable or craftable?  
Why do the cars control so poorly, especially given you need to race them from time to time? It's almost impossible to control the car while braking, for example.  
Why is there a bad, unfair, mandatory race in the middle of the game?  
Why is Max such an absolute, unlikable jerk -- not an antihero, but simply a jerk?

Even if they fixed the first two things, if they'd only added some cool parts or loot to be scavenged from the wasteland, something to look forward to while clearing out places, it would have been such a better game."
gaming,We had arcades though.
gaming,"The problem with Twilight Imperium is that there's tons of people that love the game and want to play it, but most of them don't know each other."
gaming,"Arctis pro+ gamedac. 

Excellent mic and there is side tone which lets  hear your voice as you speak. Customizable sound profiles and 7.1 surround that can be turned on or off. And it had an output for streaming. 

Volume and mute controls on the headset itself. 

Great set but a bit pricey"
gaming,bruh the prices in india 💀 (ik its inflation)
gaming,Well it's like how people don't listen to R Kelly any more because of what he did in his personal life. It's hard to separate the artist from the person. In this case though that isn't really an issue as her acting is bad in the game.
gaming,"most fun thing is to drive full speed into a short cliff just under a sniper, hit the nitrous as soon as you hit the vertical part, you will launch into the air, then smash the button to have chumbucket auto-lock onto the sniper and shoot... you will destroy the sniper in midair and the fall back down to earth and drive away"

gaming,"Yes, but they used her voice acting as well. That's why the mk fans don't like her. I mean it's not an issue to stop playing the game, add I don't think anyone I spoke to cares about what he's done outside of the game or anything we just take the piss out of it. It's really that bad."

For some reason, to me it just always looked like it should have been a patch for Insurgency (even though I know they rebuilt the game in Unreal Engine 4, leaving HL2 engine behind), but it just doesn't appear to offer me enough new stuff to justify a $40 price tag. If it ever goes on sale, I might pick it up, but until then (if ever) I'll just keep playing Insurgency when I get the itch for realistic war shooter."

Gearbox and 2k could literally build the game by sacrificing babies and you'd still get at least some people who are hype for the game.

gaming,"Regarding Red Dead Redemption 2...

Really?  Lots of people on here talk about how good the story is but how boring the open world is.  It’s actually kept me away from it because that’s how I felt about GTA V (actually the story was only adequate for me, but that’s neither here nor there).  GTA V has nothing to do but explore samey locations, play golf, do yoga, and invest in the stock market.  There was lots to see and some stuff to interact with but it was separated by lots and lots and LOTS of generic scenery.

I dunno...AC Origins was a better experience for me than GTA V (and Odyssey was a better experience than that), because at least there were some interesting historical fantasy secrets and locations to explore.  GTA V just had terrain and yoga and skyscrapers.  Which doesn’t give me much hope for RDR2 (which I will probably play at some point).

It’s probably also fair for me to point out that Origins was my first real foray in to Assassin’s Creed, so if others “did it better”, I am not aware."

gaming,I'm pretty sure it's dankey kang.
gaming,"Of course I don't think that they own Doritos.  But I do know that if it is sold in a Walmart physical store, is a desktop computer, and is meant for anything above the average users needs for computing, it is a Cyberpower PC. I also know from working in a Walmart that they are systematically replacing as much 3rd party product they can with alternatives wholey owned by Walmart, to increase profit margins.

I did however confuse the CyberpowerPC brand with the Overpowered brand.

My main point, however, is that this is not a one-off occurance in the front of OP's store.  This is a concentrated effort by Walmart to place these eSports venues in (some of) their stores."
gaming,They dropped another trailer for Detective Pickachu. A day after that Sonic trailer. Coincidence?

I,am disappointed T-T"

gaming,"Cause it’s a game reveal lmfao 

Remember when apex was number 1? Yeah that definitely lasted long didn’t it"
gaming,No offense but why does yours look infinitely better? Like seriously all offense to the company that is making the movie. Fans shouldnt be able to grab screenshots of your trailer and make something 10x better in what... 2 days ( just being generous) but ya know whatever. I never even joked about watching it.
gaming,Advice for the feed at  the main page you should add titles like movies games
gaming,not a bad game but resource gathering was such a grind...like 2 scrap metal for a mission and I was like WHAAAAAAAA? FUCK this nonsense!!! and grabbed cheatengine to get more money
gaming,"3D design, physics engine programming, storyboarding, voice-acting the list goes on"
gaming,Yep this totally makes sense. Not sure if there is easter egg to this in the new movie
gaming,Jax legitimately looks like a situation where he'd need to get custom tank tops made with velcro down the sides like stripper pants because he's not getting those arms into/through anything.
gaming,"In terms of the amount of xp it takes to get to level 99, level 92 is half of that xp."
gaming,That sounds nauseating in terms of VR.
gaming,What were you playing?
gaming,Too much. I checked how much i spent on steam through a link that they provide and the amount gave me nightmares.
gaming,0 money and most of my time  😂
gaming,"This looks like Catan on steroid.  

I'm equally scared and intrigued."
gaming,"You actually don’t have to be intelligent to use it. 
Perfect example: Look at you on here using reddit."
gaming,"I agree, its cool that mk11 wants to use a popular name for marketing but there are thousands of quality voice actors in the world looking for a gig.    

There are also thousands of better female fighters looking to get some recognition but the difference is that unlike Ronda, they do it by fighting and not by giving up and starting a different career."
gaming,I understood that reference
gaming,"Sorry, misspelled aberration.  It means ""a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically one that is unwelcome.""

So probably not the most precise term to use, as the eSports venues may not be ""unwelcome"", but it seemed right at the time"
gaming,"Thousands of people complained. But the editor said they were wrong....because it looked fine to him, on the most advanced screen in the business.....Now we know why great music producers listen to their work on an average car stereo before releasing it."
gaming,I know what my Walmart looks like and this is definitely not it.
gaming,That's crazy. We normally get one or two quick games of something else in and then one of two of something long like scythe or civ. I suppose the game gets way faster when you get better. I've played a total of like 10 times only
gaming,"Sorry buddy, seems like they went Dark because if theyd shutdown a statement would come from them, so patience."
gaming,A young Sean Penn looks wearily across the table.
gaming,It actually looks better then the Sonic I've saw at the official movie's trailer
gaming,I don’t get it
gaming,"ItS a GaMe TrAiLeR. Not like people know it’s going to be good.

-Edit: keep downvoting pease you bipolar bum fuckers."
gaming,I wanna play games like this (sad face)
gaming,"Yeah your right, but these things could be in the game for free but they arnt, and we are not benefiting from buying them but at the end reaciving a loss so why should we keep supporting them?"
gaming,"Don't know why people think otherwise. In gaming, it doesn't matter if something does 99.9 damage to you, it's whatever took the last .1 of your health that did the actual killing."
gaming,Like literally nothing. I'm usually playing Games with gold. Rarely buy standalone games
gaming,"Honestly I agree with that fur thing (though his back should be more quill-like since he *is* a hedgehog).  It looks a bit uncanny valley-ish, but I think that while it takes some getting used to, it looks better in the long run and allows the characters to blend in with the world a bit better, which if you are going to do a live action movie thats kind of the point.

But uh...  theres a lot more issues with Sonic than just the fur.  Taking some liberties is all right when it comes to stuff like figuring out what textures and such the various colored bits of a cartoon character should have, or how certain physical traits should be presented, but they took some pretty massive liberties.  The Pokemon Movie is a good example I think of how the process should be done properly, most people were originally a bit put off by the designs realism but I think for the most part have grow accustomed to the designs because they are still fairly faithful the the characters.  Sonic though I don't think is going to be well received in terms of design... probably ever.  Changing stuff to be realistic is allrgiht with this type of movie, but they didn't really even stay that true to the character.  Honestly it looks like they just used ""anthropomorphized blue hedgehog"" as a guide without even really looking at any references."
gaming,"Just stop. Stop playing pay to play games yes. But everyone needs to stop bitching about cosmetic micros. They don't hurt you, they dont affect you, people will always buy them they arent going anywhere. Theyre not a big deal and people need to grow up and just ignore them.  Theyre not forcing you to get them."
gaming,Had the second one and it was fuckin fire.

gaming,Someone tell BW that this is how you make a looter shooter
gaming,I love how you added 4 XDA
gaming,So awesome! Whose the white masked person?
gaming,What have you done...
gaming,Oooo voice acting sounds fun
gaming,"I mean, when you consider Tails is a mutant freak with two tails, maybe they thought they were being true to the source material"
gaming,"Yes. It's great. There are a lot of fake reviews out there, alt right lunatics who think the game has some how offended them with a non existent ""sjw left wing agenda""."
gaming,*The new movie looks great

gaming,Sundered and Dust: an Elysian Tale might be of interest to you if you're into Hollow Knight. Sundered is personally one of my favorite games in recent memory.
gaming,"Twitch is the place to be, as long as you know which channel the event is on. Any specific games you interested in?"
gaming,I love the part when the fox farts out a green gas cloud and it puts Noel to sleep.

gaming,"To be fair I never knew this, even though with hindsight it should be obvious."
gaming,Its not on google smartass
gaming,Ludicolo is really almost as bad as Sonic. He's supposed to be a pineapple... instead he's all beard.
gaming,"Your right there are not forcing you,that's what a free market is about being able to pay for what you want, what I'm trying to point out is the bad effects it has on the gaming market as a whole as a consequence of paying for these"
gaming,what if the end of the sonic movie has sonic put on these goggles and suddenly looks good? i also hope the final/post credits scene is skinny dr eggman stuffing his face because of his failure
gaming,Can we also talk about the mobile games that have ads of gameplay that isn’t even from that game
gaming,"""Fox, get these guys offa me!"""
gaming,ofc the obligatory ass shot. whores are on a whole different level on the internet.
gaming,"Yeah their ""realistic"" depiction of Sonic looks more like mutated human than a fictional hedgehog."
gaming,That baby zombie was fucking brutal.
gaming,I liked that game for about an hour until I hit a glitch that allowed the zombies to run straight through my walls. Pissed me off so much especially when I found out that the developers had stopped working on it or even responding to complaints many months before I gave it a shot.
gaming,How do Tails’s tails spin without getting tied up?????
gaming,then i shall steal it again.
gaming,I'll take all of your stock thank you
gaming,I mean that literally can be done with a patch.

gaming,"Story and story quests, more important than graphics or the system as the Story is what will make players come back again and again to play it; Fallout Series, Assassins Creed, Oblivion/Morrowind are examples"
gaming,Yeah I thought so. Gonna get it. Thanks. 😬
gaming,That's a feature I liked in battlefield. If you did like 80% of the damage you'd get the kill credit iirc.
gaming,Ludicolo looks the least horrifying
gaming,but I thought you were my friend sonic :(
gaming,This thing looks stressed man
gaming,Depends for me personally a great story is very important but if the gameplay is bad I can’t enjoy the game. Personally a great story with good gameplay is the most important for me.
gaming,"This game looks amazing! I would love to play! Sadly I’m among the many with friends who don’t have the stomach for strategy board games.

I bought the Game of Thrones board game and I have yet to make it past turn 3 without people quitting. Maybe one day I’ll get to play a full game..."
gaming,You mean the onion?
gaming,"That's a matter of perspective, I buy most of the skins for battlefield V, I don't feel wronged at all. I know quite a bit of work went in to making a new skin. It's whether or not you decide to support the developer, it doesn't mean buy everything they put out, though. I know battlefield delivers everytime they push out a game, so I support micros for them, but I also love Fallout, but seeing the direction 76 went, I refused to even buy the game after the beta. To think people actually spend money on a developer that doesn't even care anymore.

That's the big difference."
gaming,"They have a store locator for officially sponsored stores (there are a lot btw) and most stores run events at least every friday if not friday + two-three other nights a week. 

You will find basically everyone there has come to play a game so they can't judge you (although people are silly for judging others based on their hobbies, you do you fam)

Magic is probably THE most popular physical game fyi"
gaming,Too bad their own brand of gaming PCs is overpriced trash
gaming,Would love to see something like this again in a Pokemon game. Last chance was with Gen 5. Don’t think they’d do it

Maybe, uh, the internet can do the same thing for the Sonic movie, and the Sonic they showed can just be a dream Sonic has from eating a bad chili dog???"
gaming,My favorite part is playing the song of healing for the mummified dad. That dialogue between the dad and daughter was so sad to me as a kid.
gaming,We even do game if thrones.  We did enter spider verse.  We do a shit tonne of animation.  Pixar only left us because taxes for them increased slightly
gaming,What is this. I used to play talisman and miss it so much.
gaming,"I’m sorry, you’re complaining about this *why*?"
gaming,"This is just wrong on so many levels lol. EA peddles &gt;$50 worth of dlc for every game they make. I didnt even know pokemon dlc existed. You know exactly what you are getting if you buy a pokemon game. You NEVER know what bullshit ea is going to pull with dlc/blocking content with loot boxes/season passes. EA also has been killing people favorite franchises since forever, i don't really remember gf doing that."
gaming,I’m disappointed in all of you
gaming,SHOW ME THE MONEY
gaming,How about that Tonka search and rescue
gaming,"The gameplay has to be fun.  I don't care how amazing the graphics are, how well written the storyline is, or how emotionally moving the soundtrack is.  If the game isn't fun to play then I won't see most of the art assets, won't finish the story, and won't hear the full soundtrack."
gaming,I like to watch battle royals because they have a lot of stress involved. But I also think overwatch and csgo are really fun
gaming,"Ok, if you type ""system restore point"" into the start menu, you should get an option for ""Create a restore point"".  Click that. It should open the System Properties dialog to the System Protection tab. 

Click the System Restore... button to choose a restore point from before you updated your drivers.

gaming,Lords Blade Ciaran from the DLC
gaming,tbh it's depressing to me see riot no invest to increase the scope of the game or not even giving fun modes. Everything is about competitive play and marketing. This also create a super toxic community.  I haven't played in 3 years unless urf is on.

gaming,Totally not worth it I bought one a year or so after launch and regeted it has a few games but for the most part it's just a waste of money. The switch has been coming down in price recently and so have the games maybe have a look on ebay for a cheap one?

Also I like more multiplayer games, I liked single player before but multiplayer now all the way"
gaming,Excellent game and I too thought it would be a mindless cash grab. Instead I was engrossed in the world and the stories of what it was before. Driving into the airport (the game calls it something else making it mysterious at first) was quite nerve wracking as I recall. The worst decision was getting the best car at the end... When there was no need for it as everything was mostly done.

I definitely wouldn't classify it as a ""game as service"", since it doesn't have a mandatory subscription, to the best of my knowledge. And again, not a player, but it is possible to play offline, yes? So presumably the game will function just fine after the servers are shutdown."
gaming,"I’m aware of that, I’m simply saying people willing pay for the same game every year for stuff that can be changed in an update.

It was more a of rebuttal to the people who defend it with those kind of statements.

gaming,"I think you have missed the point I made and maybe responded to the wrong post because you seem to have straw-manned the wrong argument. 

You summarised the point - 'if they own the store, they don't have to pay anyone else a cut for distribution'. This means they are willing to risk the overheads of operating their own store, whilst also willing to risk the overheads of creating intellectual property.

People are angry at Epic for offering big cash money to pull games (which were already agreed to be in other stores, even to the point of pre-order), in order to make other peoples' intellectual property exclusive to their store.

My point was that you cannot compare what blizzard's store to epic's because it's their own intellectual property they are vendoring from their store. If Epic made a store which only sold [these](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_by_Epic_Games) games, there would be no outrage."

gaming,#moist molars. His teeth are fucking MOIST.
gaming,"The struggle is the entire point of these games. They don't have an easy mode for the same reason Silent Hill 3 doesn't have a non-scary mode.

Like I think team easy mode got the wrong idea from watching too many lore videos and they think there's this epic RPG buried beneath the difficulty instead of the video game equivalent of a haunted house with the lights turned on."

gaming,"Not surprising, Activision in general seems to have pretty much nothing planned this year.  That restructuring a while back was due to them coming to that realization that they had no new IP's and of the two games as a service cashcows they were riding on, Destiny 2 flopped so hard Bungie is no longer part of Activision, and the current WoW expansion is hemorrhaging subs.

They simply don't really have anything to talk about to build up hype.  It's better to be quiet during times like these, a lesson Blizzard learned the hard way with Immortal."

gaming,Horror games like Dead Space are pretty easy to spot for that they are though. I have never played Doki Doki Litterature Club but I never had any idea that it was a psychological horror until someone spoiled it for me. Kinda the same thing with the anime School Days. Half of the horror in those is that the horror is unexpected.
gaming,"Abzu. It’s basically a underwater exploration. Unique visual style with beautiful underwater scenery. No real objectives so you just move at your own pace. Some simple puzzle solving (really simple). Mellow soundtrack and simple intuitive controls. 

Elite:Dangerous. At least the exploration aspect of the game. Some grind to get to a solid exploration ship but once that it accomplished its off into the black to explore a 1:1 scale model of the Milky Way      
Nothing more calming than chillin to some good tunes as you travel thousands of light years to visit black holes,neutron stars solar systems and nebulas."

gaming,"To be honest i just wanted to get one for the games, do you know if the online services for the games are still up and running e.g. mario kart 8"
gaming,"Yup. Screen says ""Killed by Spider"". The game literally told the audience that the spider was in fact the thing that did the killing. It struck the killing blow, so it was in fact the killer.

The zombie did the wounding, but wounding is not killing, otherwise we'd all be dead because we've all been wounded. But we are all not dead, so we can say whatever has wounded us has not killed us.

The spider did the killing. It did not wound - it killed. It took the player from the state of being badly wounded to the state of being dead. Ergo, he was killed by a spider.

We could argue that the zombie put the player in the position to be killed by the spider - this is basic cause-and-effect. There is no doubting that the zombie caused the player to die. In this context, the meme works, because the zombie caused the player's death and ruined his run. But the zombie did not kill the player. The spider did."

gaming,Oh so that's why his eyes are so small in the Sonic Movie
gaming,"I'd disagree.  Siege requires more skill across the board.  This is mostly due to the dynamic nature of the game that comes with operator gadgets and destructibility.  There's an immense amount of problem solving and numerous ways to approach any situation.  CSGO relies heavily on mechanical skill which is good, but so does Siege in higher levels of play ON TOP of everything I mentioned and extensive map knowledge.  There's literally thousands of angles and what not on any given map.  I'm constantly seeing people find new things on old maps too along with strats being developed....especially as new ops are introduced it opens the door for even more possibilities.  I'm sure people will disagree....but having played both games and playing Siege on PC at diamond level I think it takes more skill beyond mechanical skill and map knowledge of static maps."

gaming,"I had Tonka Construction, Tonka Construction 2, Tonka Raceway, Tonka Garage, Tonka Search &amp; Rescue, Tonka Space Station. For some reason, in Tonka Garage I had an issue where in certain parts of the game everything on the screen was black outside of certain tools’ outlines. Little Kid me just assumed that’s how the game was supposed to look and even if I had no idea what colors I was painting the cars, it was the most mind blowing thing in my gaming career at that point to see cars I designed in Garage to be playable in Raceway (I would not witness anything like it in any other game I have ever played until Save Importing in Mass Effect 2).

There were other games I had similar to Tonka that I cannot remember the exact names of. One is a game from Catepillar where you would take their tractors to different points in time and would help the past, such as paving the Roman Colosseum with pavement. Another came with a keyboard attachment where you could hammer a nail, saw a log, etc. I swear Tonka Joe was in it but I can’t find the game via google to know for certain. I also had a game from Matchbox that I thought looked absolutely amazing back when I was 5 where you would patrol the city as a cop, paramedic, or a firefighter and once you did every job once, you would upgrade your vehicle to another one (red fire truck became a bigger yellow one. Police car would become a police motorcycle, and a small rounded Ambulance would become a bigger box one where if you take a sharp curve the doors would open and you see the other paramedic holding on to the cott for dear life)"

gaming,"The issue was them hyping up the product.  They were clear no Diablo 4, but they were talking about a big Diablo project sure to excite fans.  All year they were letting hype build up for it, it was being presented in such that there would be a major Diablo annoucnment.  And sure enough, come Blizzcon, there was a Diablo event lines up *on the main stage!*  The slot at Blizzcon thats used to announce new major games, WoW expansions, or even new ip's had a Diablo project lined up, with a lengthy Q&amp;A right after!

That hype is why it flopped so hard in terms of announcements.  They took a minor side project (that Blizzard barely even had a hand in developing, the damn thing is an outsourced Chinese mobile game with a reskin an minor changes) and hyped it up to an incredible degree, and then through it at a hungry audience that they should have known would probably not care.  

It was a massive flop in terms of marketing.  Bethesda for their faults shows a good way to drop a mobile game while even getting people potentially excited for it, both the announcements for Blades and Fallout shelter went well because they were treated as a side announcement not the freaking centerpiece of the entire conference.  I understand that Blizzard didn't have really *anything* super major to announce, but they could have at least picked something that their general audience would have cared about.  Swapping the Warcraft 3 reforged announcement with Immortal for example probably would have adverted this entirely, with the conference just coming off as a bit light instead of laughable.

They also should have picked better people for the Q&amp;A, the guys running it were not prepared to deal with said crowd.  That Q&amp;A is the reason those memes are repeated, they wern't made by gamers, they are quotes from the Q&amp;A."

gaming,"I disagree. Scale changes in particular are pretty dicey. This change would affect every level of production, from the live action shoot where shots were framed and actors eyeline is based on a standin's height, to modelling, rigging, surfacing, new cameras, new anim, any sort of finaling. Rendering would just be a part of a much bigger undertaking. At least the renders have had lighting setups established, so the renders could essentially be one and done, because they already know the renders in the scene work okay and look decent. Well decent might be an overstatement. 

But the fact remains, I bet half the crew at this point is ramping down. The live action crew had probably fucked off entirely. Are they going to try and bring everyone back? Rebuild tore down sets? I mean, you could try and half ass the change for cheap, bit then you're replacing shit, with different shit, which at that point, what's the point?

I've worked on full CG productions where our main character had to be recast for voice acting last minute, and all it involved was a skeleton crew to redo lipsync and small anim tweaks. For something like that, you'd be right. This would be much much messier."
gaming,Too much but I don’t regret it. Video games is such a beautiful Media. Of course you shouldn’t spend all your money for it 😂
gaming,"With DDLC? Honestly, I don't think so. I knew that it was a horror, and it still messed me up seriously, because it's not really the usual kind of horror (and I'm not just talking about jumpscares) it's much much more psychological. I wasn't ""scared"" at all during the time I played it (which is good because I usually hate horror and have never understood why people like feeling scared, even though I know that it's supposed to be the thrill and stuff) it was much more of a gut wrenching feeling, seeing how fucked up everything is, etc. School Days is similar as well, there might be a bit of an extra impact from not expecting the first instance of horror, but after that it's much more fucked up than that, at least what I've seen of it."

gaming,But can he see why kids love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch?
gaming,"Ah I see, but I guess first impressions is going to be hard to deal with as most people will assume that's how long the game will last. Maybe I'll try it when I get some extra money after the end of term. Who knows, the department might enjoy it like what happened with secret hitler last term."
gaming,At least that would have been so far off the cuff that I would have been like “hmm... quirky.” The middle ground is just weird.
gaming,"Well people are literally streaming it rn so go watch, looks better than borderlands 2 so far"
gaming,Bored of OC? Repost the same shit we've seen for years.
gaming,I was twelve hours into a Flatcore game yesterday and died in a much less foreseeable fashion than this and was considerably more upset. I restarted and died in ten minutes where I slept in a blacksmith shop and woke up standing in the lava chamber. My longest session I faced the wither and failed. I was depressed for a couple days over that one.

gaming,WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS
gaming,"I agree, Ryan Reynolds is just doing a PG Deadpool"
gaming,"If you're willing to part with $12, do the current Humble Bundle and get this and like 6 or 7 other games. You can definitely get a good grasp of it that way."
gaming,Bloodborne or Witcher 3

gaming,That Spongebob one is...ITS EATING MY SOUL
gaming,how the campaign in BO3 btw good story?
gaming,Oh you mean two player? I used that maybe once on my Wii U . Do you use yours for that? Which games ? I’m curious if I’m missing something
gaming,Gameplay is first but story is a close second. Graphics are pretty low since i can still have a blast playing n64 games but nicer graphics obviously help
gaming,Oscar does NOT have a beak. I draw the line there!
gaming,Underground-Carbon was the last good era for Need for Speed

gaming,"Love this game, had a session with 5 at easter but it took more than 5 hours which sucked a lot of interest out of the game (learning and distractions made for a painful experience for some people).

&amp;#x200B;

Where did you get those swank boxes?  All I got were the shitty plastic bags, yeah they work but not nearly as nice as all the little cardboard boxes you have?  Is it a different revision of the game?"
gaming,"I've met other people on Discord Servers that i regularly play board games with online via Tabletop Simulater (costs about 20$ on Steam).

If you watch Twitch Streamers or Let's Players on Youtube, they probably have their own community server that you can join."
gaming,"How much they spend on cosmetics for themselves should not effect your gameplay and you have no say over that. The community is horrible though, the game itself is actually pretty decent"
gaming,"Still wouldn’t happen. Publishers make 70% of their revenue from micro transactions so a publisher that doesn’t have them will receive substantially less money from their games. And will not be able to be as competitive People need to understand it’s about incentives and money. Until it gets to a point where micro transactions are losing them money, which won’t happen, they will stay is a business model"
gaming,How is that being a prick?
gaming,because of the way it is
gaming,"Plenty of videos on her IG show shes quite real. Sure you could edit that aswell, but as far as I know she has no patreon, and only sold some photosets some time ago, so i doubt that is worth video editing stuff. Not whiteknighting, but its mostly makeup and posing angles. YOu can see on more candid shots shes a real girl with fat in the right places."

gaming,"The campaign isnt really fun in BO3, Zombies, in my opinion, is its crowning achievment"
gaming,You probably should move out bro.
gaming,"Technically that's not bad for you. They still don't know there's an arsonist and all the guys you were after are dead. I mean, would it be better to have the survivors doused? Sure. But you play this as an executioner who's already got his target while dousing the remainder of the town, with little risk of being hanged."
gaming,This is ... really creepy lol!
gaming,That game has like 2 people who still play because of bots.

No, gamers doing what they always do, blow everything out of proportion."

gaming,"Try forgetting to save on a legend, accidentally killing it, and having to reset, putting you three gyms back. IN HOENN!"
gaming,"You can try searching online.  Most Q/A jobs are temporary so you may be better off finding a temp agency to work with.

Keep in mind the job may kill your love for games, we are talking about playing the same game for 6 months at various levels of finished doing the same remedial tasks in game in an attempt to break things.  You're not just playing videogames, it's a structured process"
gaming,"a HOT DOG ON A STICK rents out space in a WALMART???

how does he pay rent"
gaming,"Your definition of real games must include only dark souls, counter strike or some “classic” then?"
gaming,"I don't know, this man seems to know his wild sonics."
gaming,I disagree. He doesnt want to support that. Nothing wrong with that.
gaming,"For Honor, a game one of it's kind. Year 3 but there are still lot of new heroes and updates to come and it is under 10€ for the cheapest edition wich is definitely worth it"
gaming,"I literally just bought a switch like a week ago and I'm just started playing BOTW. It's worth it dude, the portability of it is nuts. If your back starts hurting from sitting in a chair while playing docked, take it off the dock and lay in bed or on the couch and continue playing."
gaming,Lol it killed me at the guy was a midget
gaming,"Wow.  Looks like a fat guy with skinny legs, painted half blue running for the toilet."
gaming,"I agree completely!

Could it have been better? Yes.

Was it fun, and fairly connected with the original world? Yes.

The game I want to see them make a movie of, is Zelda.

But with the remake of Aladdin, and horror of Sonic, I pray they pick a great director for it!"
gaming,"Never played the campaign or multiplayer, but it’s nothing extraordinary from what I’ve heard. I only play the Zombie mode/maps, since you can play it split screen or ko-op"

gaming,"There is a premium box you can buy, which these guys have, and it's pictured. It makes setup and cleanup so much better."
gaming,"Oh hell this gives me flashbacks of trying to dive for pearls, getting massacred by a giant crocodile thing (I forget the name), then spending way too much time diving AGAIN AND AGAIN grabbing my loot bag and just trying to get a little bit closer to the surface before dying each time.

Then going to get my frog tame thinking ""oh yeah hes fast in the water he'll be able to outrun shit and protect me during the 10s it takes me to get my bag and re-mount"" until OH GOD A SQUID JUST DEVOURED MY FROG. Eventually I tamed up a whole team of high level frogs just for the sake of ocean massacres. I got my revenge."
gaming,"You realize they’re compensated, right? They aren’t some lot of altruistic heroes."
gaming,....I thought that was Day Man. I'll show myself out.
gaming,"Haha yep, that's accurate."
gaming,Because no one wants a PS4
gaming,"""he had seen **everything**"""
gaming,"Game of Thrones is *very* fiddly, especially combat. It's also very backstabby (by design) and requires a lot of subterfuge and unofficial alliances. Then there's all of the different universal things that need to be resolved after everyone's turns (all of the tracks) and votes.  


None of that is in Scythe. Scythe is a total point salad engine builder + area control game. Each player has a board with 4 possible actions, and each turn, you choose which of those actions you do, with the caveat being you can't do the same action twice in a row (with the exception of one of the nations, whose special ability is to do just that). The great thing about it is that everyone can play to the strength of whichever nation and player board they received, as there are tons of ways to earn points in this game (opposed to there being only one way to earn points that everyone is trying to do, like GOT).  


Additionally, once you play through a game, the likelihood of anyone needing to refer to the rule book more than once or twice in a game is *very* low. While with GOT, you're going to need the rule book to reference until you've played probably 4 or 5 times.  


I could get more granular, but want to keep this high level, as a good part of this game is discovering it!"
gaming,Where are these dates?
gaming,"Yeah, our fast time has slowly cranked up over a long period. We all sort of know what we're doing at this point and there's like a whole meta to it now. Amazing that it never gets old."
gaming,180+tax usd. Its a Seagate drive that Microsoft sells
gaming,My gaming has can to a halt due to no new socom.

gaming,Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
gaming,I haven't. Looks amazing.
gaming,"huh, another mystery solved"

gaming,"It's actually not that bad, it's basically the same mouth, only centered and follows perspective properly instead of shifting left and right because of 2D animation. His hair shapes are the same way. I forgive these easily. 

The eyes and body proportions are unforgivable."
gaming,"Valve did though, at least that's the excuse I heard for them not makkng HL3"
gaming,"If they didnt work so many hours, would you have made this post?"
gaming,I guess this explains the bad cgi sonic
gaming,"They shouldn't be downvoting you.   If the guy was shot by multiple guns, the gunman that made the killing shot is the murderer, everyone else is an accomplice."
gaming,You can never be too safe.

gaming," You probably should embrace it, bro. get a beer and a cigarette"
gaming,Those gloves were a god damn lie.
gaming,This is what ALL my friend were thinking after the trailer came out😂
gaming,I'm not sure why your being downvoted for literally describing the thing that happened to you.
gaming,"""And of course, a lack of game parity—where coveted titles never make it to the PC—has vexed the PC on occasion.""

If anything... PC ports are more common now than ever.

""Indeed, Pollack told PCWorld that 20 million is just 3 percent of the estimated 550 million people who “game” on PCs. And that 550 million is a conservative estimate—other analysts estimate as many as 1.3 billion PC gamers. As difficult as that is to believe.""

Oh nevermind, just a clickbait title."
gaming,"overwatch does the same thing, but they don't seperate them out, so a lot of ""love tap"" players think their god send tracers when they never appear in the kill feed."
gaming,I can confirm the radical attitude
gaming,"The graphics quality I thought was a major upgrade from GTA, which came out a year before."
gaming,That happens at a place near me
gaming,"Can I just say that asda Morrisons sainsbury and tesco are fucking years behind you lot.

Years."
gaming,"I hate motion controls in general,  so i always disable them.  Played Zelda with them,  but couldn't stand them.  i move around a lot lol
Edit: and honestly,  after thinking about it,  the powerA controllers try to connect every time a button or trigger is pressed,  which kills the batteries pretty easily. I don't like that.  But i use rechargeable batteries,  so it's not a big deal,  just annoying"
gaming,Check the guild for more quests.
gaming,They're paid so fuck off
gaming,Wha wha we wow!
gaming,"Well, something similar to Sims... really don't know. But if you want playing God then ""Black and White"".

Also maybe you could check out ""Stardew Valley"" or ""Cities Skylines"" or ""Planet Coaster""."
gaming,"but they advocate and implement live service models in all of their AAA titles along with Activision, so yes"
gaming,New to me at least I was unaware untill recently.
gaming,"That’s the thing. If we know we’re gonna lose, we start doing some dumb shit to ease the blow of losing and make us laugh. (Provided that we aren’t playing with some poor random) 

just last night, we started to lose an aram pretty hard to a tankish team and all my friends were ad and I didn’t really know how to play the Zoe I got. So all my friends changed from building ad to ap on-hit. And I built full tank with a Bork and a witts end . We ended up winning since the whole enemy team only had armors."
gaming,I don't think they did. And the reason they're not making hl3 is because it'll never live up to expectations of it were released today. It'll be such a letdown considering the amount of hype behind it.
gaming,"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

&amp;#x200B;

this is more cursed than the movie"
gaming,Where can I get this
gaming,That thing doesn't obey the law of physics at all.
gaming,Truly the darkest timeline
gaming,"I’ve played a few of these. Rimworld is definitely up there for me as it’s a colony management game where people have unique roles and skills they excel at be it growing plants, doctoring, hunting, crafting, etc. people have their own traits and quirks and their stats level up the more work they do in that field so you can totally get invested into a group of them. They even need recreational activities, and ways to manage stress and other stuff. 

That being said though, the end goal is to escape the planet so it isn’t an everlasting thing like the sims. But you can have different settings to spice up the game and it can be quite a challenging survival or suited to be a base builder. 

Quite a few mods as well if you’re into those to spice it up even more.

Edit: if you have any questions feel free to ask!"
gaming,Good lord this is gonna cause a lot of creepy DMs
gaming,If the movie actually did that I would be slightly more okay with how Sonic looks in it.
gaming,"What are you gonna do, bleed on me?"
gaming,"I personally say story. An interesting and well-written story will keep the player on the game for much longer, and the player would most likely forgive/forget most of the other faults in the game unless they are very noticeable. But, this is all just my opinion."
gaming,It’s confirmed my friend
gaming,The boy legs scare me the most
gaming,It’s called freedom to spend how one wants.
gaming,your friend looks like he was more your brother's age
gaming,Still better than what they did in the movie
gaming,"In that case, and with a 4 GHz quad cpu (with hyperthreading is even better) or higher, and 1070 gpu or higher and at least 16 GB of RAM will work fine for that range of gaming, and more than enough for student work unless you edit 4k video as part of school. Hard to recommend a specific laptop, but Asus is a great manufacturer."
gaming,There bE LOads of ways you can do it
gaming,Online dating is terrible and soul crushing.
gaming,I got both and I honestly prefer my Xbox one. The PS4 literally just sits there collecting dust until an exclusive that interests me comes out.

gaming,I think it's okay if you have knockback as well.
gaming,They are.  Some of these gay men and women went through a time when they were hated for it.  Now pedophiles act like they are the new victims of persecution.
gaming,"Jim ""Eggman ""Robotnik"""" Carrey is going to capture Sonic and imprison him for years, causing his arms and legs to atrophy. Meanwhile, without an enemy to best him, Eggman is free to experiment and develop his robot army. Part of that will be replacing a number of his limbs, including his legs, with cybernetic prosthetics. Now no longer moving under his own power, Eggman will quickly gain weight. He will also perform genetic experiments, fusing animal and human DNA along with a splash of Sonic's to create the Furry race. A war almost immediately ensued between the Humans and the Furries.

Overtly, Eggman was supporting his creations, but near the end of the war, after it was clear the humans were doomed to extinction, it came to light that he was selling weapons to both sides. The Furries, feeling the deep sting of betrayal, broke ties with their creator. He does not take this well, and swears to capture them all and roboticize them.

A group of freedom fighters break Sonic out. Despite his atrophied limbs, he is able to retain his speed, but needs the use of goggles to run without hurting his eyes now.

After they bring the malnourished and half-blind hedgehog to the grove, a celebration is held. He can't eat much because of his state, but his first bites of real food come in the form of chili dogs. They were rather subpar, but to him they taste like freedom, creating a lifelong passion for the simple food."
gaming,"I know split screen is, but is there proof of it on PC? Usually people have to mod it in."
gaming,"What drive should i choose before clicking system restore? (btw, will this delete everything from my computer)"

Just make sure it’s not a gambling parlor."
